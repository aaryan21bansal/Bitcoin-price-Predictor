French police launch manhunt for horse mutilators,"More than 30 horses have been killed or mutilated around France in recent months Police in France have launched a manhunt for two suspects after the latest in a spate of horse mutilations. Forty officers have flown by helicopter to the town of Losne, near Dijon, after a horse was attacked on Sunday morning. Dozens of horses have been killed or maimed around the country this year, prompting public outcry. Police do not know why the animals are being targeted, nor whether it is the work of one person, or if initial attacks have inspired copycat killings. During the latest incident, the horse's owner called police at around 02:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Sunday after seeing lamp lights in his meadow. The Dijon prosecutor's office told local media that the horse had been injured in its flank, although the injury was not very severe. More than 30 other cases have been reported in France, with horses being left with their ears and genitals cut off. Another was found disembowelled. As part of their investigation into one attack in Yonne, north-west of Dijon, last month,police released an artist's impression of an alleged perpetrator spotted at the scene.,external Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie later pledged that those responsible for the attacks would be brought to justice. ""All branches of the state are mobilising to get justice done,"" said Mr Denormandie during a visit to Saint-EusÃ¨be, in central France, where a horse's ear had recently been cut off. ""There is clearly a professionalism, people acting with a certain level of technique,"" he added. Serge Lecomte, president of the French Equestrian Federation, accompanied Mr Denormandie during the visit. ""It is cruel savagery of a kind we have rarely seen before,"" he told AFP. ""Is it a cult? Cruelty towards animals is the precursor to cruelty towards humans"".

More train services restored as schools reopen,"Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase. Trains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work. Rail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures. West Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were ""big changes"", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems. ""If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,"" he told the BBC. ""And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing."" One passenger told the BBC: ""I think you just have to get outâ¦ and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears."" Another reported there was plenty of space: ""I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed."" Jacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were ""doing everything they can"" to reassure people travel was safe. The group said no service was reported as ""close to social distancing capacity"". Coronavirus: Rail passengers to be warned when trains are busy Coronavirus: Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Train operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren. Where possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room. Staff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children. ""Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,"" said Ms Starr. Over the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. They want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. Up to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. The railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. During the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. So there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return. Train companies are now working to manage passenger flowsby warning people if a particular service is busy. Some modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board. Southeastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train. The Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times In particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of ""wear and tear"" on railway infrastructure, the effects ""knock-on delays"" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station. ""Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,"" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC. Mr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: ""The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares."" He said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. At the end of August,the government launched an advertising campaignencouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. However, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place.

Mystery seeds prompt Amazon US policy change,"The unidentified seeds appear to have been posted from China to US addresses Amazon says it has banned foreign sales of seeds in the US after thousands of Americans received unsolicited packets of seeds in the mail, most from China. The online retail giant told the BBC that it will now only allow the sale of seeds by sellers based in the US. US officials said gardeners should not plant seeds of unknown origin. The packages are believed to be part of a global ""brushing"" scam to gain positive reviews for online selling sites. Amazon's new guidelines, in effect since 3 September, also prohibit the sale of seeds within America by non-US residents. It added that sellers may be banned if they do not follow the new guidelines. But the retailer has not confirmed if its ban will extend to other countries. News of the policy change was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. At least 14 plant species have been identified among the mystery packages, including mint, lavender and roses. Amazon says it will only allow domestic sales of seeds in the US Unsolicited seed packages are also being reported in other countries, including the UK.Last month Scottish authorities advised people not to handle the seeds, for fear they could damage local ecosystems. In an update on 11 August, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said experts analysing the seeds found few problems with them, and that China was assisting with investigations. But the USDA has warned people against planting the seeds, saying they could be non-native species or carry pests and diseases. So-called ""brushing"" scams involve sellers sending out low value items such as seeds or rings. Each fake ""sale"" then generates an online review that appears to boost the seller's legitimacy.

Crime agency under fire over bank signature forgery,"The National Crime Agency in Westminster, London The National Crime Agency is facing criticism for failing to investigate reports alleging that banks forged signatures and fabricated evidence in court actions to repossess homes. MPs urged the NCA a year ago to investigate the matterfollowing a BBC News investigation. The NCA has received at least 19 boxes of evidence relating to 362 incidents. But anti-corruption campaigners and MPs say victims haven't been contacted and no investigation has been started. The NCA says it is making a ""thorough assessment"" of the material submitted to determine whether a criminal investigation was necessary. ""We are continuing to assess the material, including additional information supplied in May 2020,"" said an NCA spokesman. ""Together with partners in the FCA and SFO, we are making a thorough assessment to determine whether there are grounds for a criminal or regulatory investigation."" Government-owned bank 'forging signatures' in repossession cases MPs call for inquiry into alleged forgery of signatures In July 2019, an investigation by the BBC set out evidence of signature forgery on court documents used by banks and their representatives to repossess. Handwriting experts confirmed that in many cases sent to the NCA, signatures used over the same name could not have been signed by the same person; and that the same signature had been signed over different names.

Following the BBC investigation, the Treasury Committee urged the NCA to investigate the matter. MPs say the extensive documentation submitted to the NCA supports allegations, denied by the banks, that evidence has been fabricated or concealed in court actions to recover personal and business debts. But anti-corruption campaigners say not a single complainant has been contacted by the NCA among hundreds of victims. In one example, Anna Britton, 49, from Portishead, was forced to sell her home and move back with her two daughters to her parents' two-bed flat after a dispute with a bank over business debts. The three had to share a room and were homeless for more than three years. Anna says the trauma led to her then-12-year-old daughter becoming severely anorexic. Anna Britton was forced to sell her home after a dispute with a bank over business debts ""We have been to hell and back. When I realised that I'd been put through that using a fabricated document, you think - you gave me 12 weeks to sell my house. You sold my furniture, you sold my clothes, you sold my children's teddies. You left us with one bag each of clothing. You've destroyed every hope and dream we had. ""I've watched my daughter being tube-fed. She was hospitalised for three months, her heart rate was at 33, her sugar levels dangerously low - we almost lost her. She's now 14 and still recovering from what she's been through."" As the bank pursued the business debts through the courts, it relied on a personal guarantee document which Anna says she never signed. Personal guarantees allow banks to pursue individuals' personal assets, including their family homes, to repay debts owed by a business. No original was produced of the personal guarantee document. Instead the bank's lawyers produced what they said was a photocopy of the original document, showing a Â£47,000 personal guarantee dated 26 October 2012, appearing to bear her signature. Ms Britton says the signature must have been photocopied and pasted on from other paperwork. The document was purportedly witnessed by her financial adviser. However, after the judgment against her had been given, the financial adviser confirmed that he had stopped working for her by that date - and had flown to Spain on 21 October for a two-week holiday. Flight tickets proved that he could not have been present on the date the document was signed. Like many defendants in bank disputes, Anna couldn't afford legal representation and instead represented herself, eventually losing her case against the bank's highly-paid team of solicitors and barristers. Since the Treasury committee's letter to the NCA last year, it has received 19 box files of documentary evidence accumulated by the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign to support customers' allegations, which they say amounts to serious, organised criminal activity which must be investigated. Yet campaigners say in the year since then, the NCA has failed to contact any of the victims to investigate their claims, ignoring calls to act from anti-corruption campaigners including Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld. Steve Baker is calling on the NCA to investigate now or explain its reasoning to the Treasury ""I find it extraordinary that the NCA has received so much detailed evidence of forged documents and signatures by banks. They were asked by the Treasury Committee over a year ago to investigate this but they have never even embarked on an investigation,"" he told the BBC. ""And to talk about making an 'assessment' is an excuse they keep giving. You can't 'assess' for 15 months. There has to be a proper criminal investigation."" In a letter to the NCA last year, the Treasury committee urged the NCA to engage personally with the online pressure group, the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign, which has accumulated a large body of documentary evidence suggesting forgery and fabrication by banks and their representatives in repossession actions. The campaign's founder, former KPMG partner Julian Watts, says NCA director general Lynne Owens has repeatedly withdrawn from four pre-arranged appointments to discuss the evidence. ""The NCA seems to be ignoring calls from the Treasury committee and our local police and crime commissioner to investigate the forgery of signatories at banks,"" said MP and Treasury committee member Steve Baker. ""These forgeries could have cost my constituents and people across the country their homes. It's really important for faith in our institutions that the National Crime Agency gets on and investigates these very serious allegations. ""But the NCA hasn't investigated properly. That is not good enough and I'm calling on the NCA either to investigate now - or to explain why not."" Asked for a statement about the evidence, the bank trade body, UK Finance said: ""Forgery is a criminal offence and banks will continue to be vigilant against such types of fraud. ""We urge anyone with evidence of forgery taking place to report it to their bank as well as the relevant authorities.""

"Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say","Hundreds of thousands of people may wait until 2022 for justice despite a government announcement to speed up work in the Crown Courts, lawyers warn. Ministers unveiled measures - including holding suspects for longer in England and Wales - in an attempt to manage pressure on courts amid the pandemic. But critics say delays in criminal courts are entirely of the government's making and pre-date coronavirus. More than 9,000 trials have been put back since the UK went into lockdown. What powers do the police have during the pandemic? Locations of the 'Nightingale courts' in England and Wales revealed Minister warns over court case backlog from virus On Sunday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it wants Parliament to pass temporary legislation to extend the time that defendants can be held in custody in England and Wales while awaiting trial. The law is one of the most important wheels of the criminal justice machine because it ensures that justice is as swift as possible for both suspects and victims. At present, defendants can only be held for 182 days after their first appearance in court, before there has to be an application to a judge to keep them inside for longer. Under the government's proposal, from the end of this month that will be two months longer. In practice, this decision builds more time into the court system - and it is part of a package of measures to manage the impact of coronavirus on the courts. The Ministry of Justice's main offices in Westminster will house a temporary court to ease the backlog Judges and court managers are struggling to find enough space to safely manage the social distancing of hundreds of people who would normally come into their buildings every day. But criminal barristers say that the government's case is disingenuous. They say the delays to justice are of the government's own making, not because of coronavirus. They accuse ministers of taking a political decision to introduce yet more delay - which could lead to cases collapsing if witnesses withdraw cooperation - rather than finding the cash to get more courts operational. According to official figures, more than37,000 Crown Court cases were outstanding before the pandemic struck,externalthe UK. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA), which represents barristers who prosecute and defend across the country, says the backlog is now 43,000. In recent years, the number of courtrooms in regular use has fallen as part of cuts to the courts budget - and as the number of sitting days has fallen, the backlog of cases has grown. James Mulholland QC, chairman of the CBA, said that the delays to justice were damaging to suspects, victims and witnesses. ""You don't resolve the delays by incorporating further delays into the system,"" he said. ""The people you punish unfairly by this mechanism are not only those wrongly accused of crime, because not everyone in custody is guilty - but the witnesses who will have to wait even longer to be heard."" ""The backlog could have gone away if the government had allowed judges to sit. Then along comes Covid, and the crisis that they've created, they can't properly address."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government's wider package of measures will get the criminal courts system ""back to where it needs to be"". ""This temporary extension to custody time limits will keep victims and the public safe, and we should not apologise for making that our priority,"" he said. ""At the same time, the measures I have announced today will get the criminal courts system back to where it needs to be - reducing delays and delivering speedier justice for all."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? The latest plan includes installing plastic screens in often cramped and confined courtrooms to help reduce the risk of virus spread. The government has already opened 10 ""Nightingale"" court sites - additional facilities to help manage the burden. But only two are dedicated to criminal work. The Ministry of Justice has now pledged an extra 1,600 court staff and Â£80m towards more Nightingale courts for crime. But barristers say the money being spent on warehousing defendants could be better spent on getting existing courts operational.

Dozens arrested as Belarus cracks down on protests,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Hundreds of people have been arrested in Belarus following a fourth consecutive weekend of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. At least 633 people were detained during the unrest, the interior ministry said on Monday. Thousands more defied heavy security and rallied in the capital Minsk, where troops and water cannon were deployed. The demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after his re-election last month amid allegations of ballot-rigging. Mass unrest since then has seen at least four people killed and hundreds injured as the government tries to stamp out dissent. A number of opposition figures have fled the country. On Saturday, activist Olga Kovalkova became the latest to say she had taken refuge in neighbouring Poland amid threats of imprisonment. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest 'We can breathe for the first time in our lives' Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has accused Western nations of interfering. Protesters, human rights activists and observers say riot police are brutally suppressing peaceful marches in the former Soviet republic. Belarus borders Russia, on which it depends heavily for energy and with which it historically has close ties, as well as Ukraine and EU states. The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the republic. It said some 363 people had been sent to detention centres pending court hearings. Eyewitnesses told Russia's Interfax news agency that police began to make arrests in Minsk after the unsanctioned rally ended and people were going home. Video footage on Sunday shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. Protesters were chased with batons in Minsk Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces. ""They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Belta news agency. Sunday has become the key day for street demonstrations since the rallies began. In recent days, the security forces - dressed all in black with balaclavas over their faces - targeted university students as they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans. Protesters streamed through Minsk One protester in Minsk, who gave her name as Lyudmila, told the BBC earlier that the demonstrators were undeterred by the security forces. ""We are definitely not ready to get back to the life we had for many years now,"" she said. ""We finally feel like we matter because we've been living in apathy for way too long and now we just have this feeling of solidarity and we actually think that - well, I feel personally that - changes already are happening so that's definitely not the time to give up."" Protests have also been reported in other Belarusian cities and towns including Grodno, Mogilev and Gomel. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk Sunday's rally had several phases. The first was the tense and uncertain. Security forces had used razor wire to close off the obvious gathering points, Minsk's main monuments and squares, and were standing guard behind them. Would-be protesters stood awkwardly on street corners wondering where and when the march would start. Those in small groups were vulnerable and we watched as a man holding the outlawed red and white flag of the opposition was dragged into a car by security officers and driven away. Then, as the numbers grew, there were nervy stand-offs near Independence Square. As they grew in confidence the demonstrators approached, berating the riot police at the barricades that now blocked the road. At about 16:00 the crowd swelled exponentially as people marched out of the centre. This was no longer the brave early arrivals, it was Belarusians young and old. Some were in fancy dress, others wearing clothes that directly mocked the riot police, the Omon. There were families, children, dogs - someone even brought a goose. For the fourth Sunday in a row President Lukashenko's attempts to stop the protest against him failed. The activist said she had left for Poland as she would have faced a long jail term had she not agreed to leave Belarus. Ms Kovalkova said security forces had driven her to a border post where she was able to board a bus to Poland after the driver recognised her. A spokesman for Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country would offer support to victims of repression in Belarus. Opposition activist Olga Kovalkova (seen here on 22 August) has now left Belarus On Friday,opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has sought refuge in Lithuania, urged the UN to help halt the authorities' crackdown on protesters. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, represented the chief opposition to Mr Lukashenko in the election, entering the presidential race after her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, and another candidate were jailed. She said the opposition was demanding an end to the police violence, the immediate release of all political prisoners, and a free and fair election. Last month,EU leaders agreed to impose sanctions,external- including asset freezes - on as yet unnamed Belarusian officials involved in alleged election-rigging, brutality and imprisonment of protesters. The exact sanctions are still being worked out. The UN special rapporteur on Belarus, Anais Marin, said Mr Lukashenko's re-election as president was ""completely manipulated"" and ""people's votes were stolen"". This video can not be played A 73-year-old great-grandmother has turned into an unlikely hero for demonstrators in Belarus She accused the Belarus police of torture, citing as one example a 16-year-old who was ""so badly beaten up he was left in a coma"". ""The authorities must release all those arbitrarily arrested,"" she said. ""The government is waging an insane war against its own people."" Mr Lukashenko has denied any allegations of vote-rigging. He has blamed some EU nations, in particular Poland and Lithuania, of trying to force regime change. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. This video can not be played Lukashenko leaves helicopter wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle On Thursday, he indicated he was open to moving closer to Russia, saying the protests had ""prompted us to make relevant conclusions"".

More train services restored as schools reopenTrain operators will reintroduce more services on a new timetable catering for schoolchildren.Business,"Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase. Trains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work. Rail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures. West Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were ""big changes"", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems. ""If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,"" he told the BBC. ""And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing."" One passenger told the BBC: ""I think you just have to get outâ¦ and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears."" Another reported there was plenty of space: ""I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed."" Jacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were ""doing everything they can"" to reassure people travel was safe. The group said no service was reported as ""close to social distancing capacity"". Coronavirus: Rail passengers to be warned when trains are busy Coronavirus: Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Train operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren. Where possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room. Staff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children. ""Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,"" said Ms Starr. Over the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. They want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. Up to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. The railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. During the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. So there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return. Train companies are now working to manage passenger flowsby warning people if a particular service is busy. Some modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board. Southeastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train. The Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times In particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of ""wear and tear"" on railway infrastructure, the effects ""knock-on delays"" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station. ""Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,"" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC. Mr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: ""The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares."" He said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. At the end of August,the government launched an advertising campaignencouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. However, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place.

"Mystery seeds prompt Amazon US policy changeThousands of Americans have received unsolicited packets of seeds this year, mostly from China.US & Canada","The unidentified seeds appear to have been posted from China to US addresses Amazon says it has banned foreign sales of seeds in the US after thousands of Americans received unsolicited packets of seeds in the mail, most from China. The online retail giant told the BBC that it will now only allow the sale of seeds by sellers based in the US. US officials said gardeners should not plant seeds of unknown origin. The packages are believed to be part of a global ""brushing"" scam to gain positive reviews for online selling sites. Amazon's new guidelines, in effect since 3 September, also prohibit the sale of seeds within America by non-US residents. It added that sellers may be banned if they do not follow the new guidelines. But the retailer has not confirmed if its ban will extend to other countries. News of the policy change was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. At least 14 plant species have been identified among the mystery packages, including mint, lavender and roses. Amazon says it will only allow domestic sales of seeds in the US Unsolicited seed packages are also being reported in other countries, including the UK.Last month Scottish authorities advised people not to handle the seeds, for fear they could damage local ecosystems. In an update on 11 August, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said experts analysing the seeds found few problems with them, and that China was assisting with investigations. But the USDA has warned people against planting the seeds, saying they could be non-native species or carry pests and diseases. So-called ""brushing"" scams involve sellers sending out low value items such as seeds or rings. Each fake ""sale"" then generates an online review that appears to boost the seller's legitimacy.

"'It's not something you get over, ever'","This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' Lisa and Andrew Roussos say they feel as though they are stuck in May 2017. That's when their eight-year-old daughter Saffie was killed in the Manchester Arena bombing. Saffie was the youngest victim of the attack. A little girl with striking big eyes and a mane of dark hair, who loved dancing and making people laugh. Lisa and Andrew say she was a real live-wire who ""never sat still"". The pain of her loss is as great as ever. ""It's not something you get over, ever,"" Lisa says. ""Every morning you wake up. It happens again. She died that day, every day. ""That's just how it is. And we have to live with that."" Now the Roussos family and the other families bereaved that night are steeling themselves for a difficult few months. The public inquiry into the bombing, which starts hearing evidence on Monday, will examine every aspect of the attack, including whether it could have been prevented, the emergency response and the experiences of each of the 22 people who died. Saffie's parents say they still feel too raw to hear information about her last moments. ""I don't want to know about her injuries and what she went through,"" Lisa says. ""It's painful enough without knowing the details."" But the couple do have a lot of other questions which they want answers to. Andrew says the attack ""could have been prevented, it could have been stopped and Saffie and the others could have been here with us"". ""And that's what we want out of it,"" he says. ""To find out why there were so many wrongs."" Referring to the way the emergency services responded to the attack, Lisa adds: ""It was just complete chaos, nobody had a clue what to do, how to react. ""It was just a complete shambles. For those people that did make mistakes, the police, fire service, MI5, for them to admit their mistakes I think would be a good thing for them, as well as us."" Saffie's Ariana Grande ticket was a treasured Christmas present. She went to the concert with her big sister Ashlee and their mum Lisa. Andrew came to collect them, with Saffie's 11-year-old brother Xander and the family's pet chihuahua Binky in tow. By chance, a press photographer took some pictures of Andrew and Xander outside the arena, in the aftermath of the bomb. You can see the shock and bewilderment on their faces, Xander clutching the dog as his father searched for his wife and children. They came across Ashlee, sitting on the pavement outside the arena. She was bleeding but conscious, and being looked after by members of the public. Reassured by this, Andrew carried on looking for Lisa and Saffie. He says: ""It was just like a horror movie, there were kids screaming there were kids injured on the floor. ""There were people around and they were all crying, it was just... I have no words."" Andrew feels that the police were not in command. ""I asked every police officer that I went past,"" he says. ""They just said just keep looking. ""Nobody had control of it, because nobody gave me any indication of what to do, where the injured were. ""Nobody said to me, 'right stay here, let me make some phone calls let me get in touch with some people and see'. They just left you to just wander round."" Andrew and Xander spent all night searching. Eight-year-old Saffie Roussos was the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack They thought all of the injured had been brought out of the arena and had no idea that Lisa and Saffie were on the floor of the foyer just yards away from them. Andrew says: ""My daughter and my wife were lying on this floor. Do you know how that feels? ""I could have been with them, particularly Saffie. I could have been holding her hand, instead of a stranger. Imagine how she was feeling lying there?"" Father and son went to three hospitals before they found Lisa the next morning. Andrew says: ""They told me to prepare for the worst. If she was going to make it there was an 80-90% chance of her being paralysed from the neck down."" Andrew was exhausted and already at rock bottom. But he still had hopes of finding Saffie alive. He'd heard that children who were displaced at the arena were sheltering in nearby hotels. He grabbed a police officer at the hospital and pleaded again for information. Eventually it came. Fourteen hours after the explosion Andrew learned that Saffie was dead. After multiple operations, Lisa Roussos has defied the doctors' prediction of paralysis. She is a gentle person with calm determination - and she rarely talks publicly about the horrors of the attack. She tells me: ""The worst thing for me was - is - if Saffie could have been saved."" I ask her if it's something that she plays over in her head? ""I have done, yeah,"" she says. ""To think that, not just Saffie, the other people. How could they leave injured people in the arena for hours? It's just madness. ""I remember lying there thinking help will be here soon, and in the end it felt like I was lying there for hours. [I thought] 'why is nobody coming?'"" The Roussos family also have many questions for the security service MI5. They want to hear the detail of what was known about the bomber Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem who helped to build the bomb. But some of the hearings involving MI5 will be held behind closed doors, without the families or their lawyers expected to be present. They're being restricted on grounds of national security. Lisa says: ""Obviously you're having to put your full trust in the (inquiry) chairman. But this inquiry is not about trust, it should be about transparency, and I feel that we won't get that without having a representative in the room."" Andrew adds: ""We've got five or six law firms representing all the families, so let's have one barrister from each firm in that room. ""All I hear is lessons learned, but lessons haven't been learned, and lessons will never be learned, unless we get that transparency and honesty from the people involved to get the answers that we need.""

Inquiry into Manchester Arena terror attack opens,"The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more The public inquiry into the Manchester Arena terror attack has begun. The hearing comes more than three years after Salman Abedi set off a bomb as people left a concert on 22 May 2017, killing himself and 22 others. It was due to start in June, but was delayed by the trial of Abedi's brother Hashem, who wasjailed for at least 55 years for 22 murders on 20 August. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened. The Manchester Arena Inquiry wasestablished on 22 October 2019by Home Secretary Priti Patel with the aim of investigating the victims' deaths. Ms Patel said it was ""vital that those who survived or lost loved ones... get the answers that they need and that we learn the lessons, whatever they may be"". It will have a much wider scope than Lord Kerslake's review of the ""preparedness for and emergency response to"" the attack, which in March 2018concluded that there had been some failings in the response. The inquiry, which will be chaired by Sir John Saunders, will ""explore the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the terror attack"", according to its website. It will look at whether the attack could have been prevented, what happened on 22 May 2017, the security arrangements around the arena, the emergency response to the bombing and the radicalisation of Salman Abedi. The inquiry will also hear how each of the individual victims died and hear personal evidence about them from their families. The inquiry will look at a number of things, including the emergency response to the attack Speaking in October, Ms Patel said she established the inquiry aftercarefully considering advice from Sir John, who concluded that due to legal constraints, a ""full, fair and fearless"" investigation could not be ""achieved through the inquests and must be done by establishing a statutory public inquiry"". It will take place in two courtrooms in Manchester Magistrates' Court, which will mostly be filled with legal teams and ""core participants"", defined as ""individuals, organisations or entities with a significant interest in an important aspect of the matters to which the inquiry relates"". Social distancing guidelines mean a further two courtrooms will be available for members of the public - the majority of whom will be victims' families - and a small number of journalists to use. Further hubs will established in nearby buildings. The inquiry's website said the focus would first be on determining ""exactly what happened"" and then on working out ""what must be done to prevent it from happening again"". Public inquiries cannot determine criminal or civil liability, but do have the capacity to highlight where failings have occurred. Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing In the aftermath of the attack, the police conducted a criminal investigation, which culminated in Hashem Abedi being convicted earlier this year and jailed last month, while the coroner opened inquests into the deaths. However, following a ruling by Sir John that evidence from MI5 and the police should bekept secret on national security grounds, he called for a public inquiry, which would allow such testimony to be heard in closed sessions. The inquiry, which is expected to last for about four months, will hear testimony from a wide variety of witnesses, including some who were at the arena on the night of the attack and some who helped in the emergency response. It will also hear, in those closed sessions, from the security services about what was known about Salman Abedi and what steps were taken in relation to him. Those giving evidence will be questioned by legal representatives for the inquiry and for those with ""core participant"" status, which includes the emergency services, the Home Office, the victims' families, the arena owners and Kyle Lawler, an arena steward whoSir John previously said""may have played a significant role or may be subject to explicit or significant criticism"". CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up More than 900 people were injured in the blast and a group of those survivors made a legal challenge to be given ""core participant"" status. In April, Sir John ruled they would not be given that status and two months later, following an appeal and a judicial review,his ruling was upheld. Martin Hibbert, who was the closest casualty to survive, said the group were ""perplexed as to the ruling, given what we've seen, what we've heard and what we've been through"". ""We were there and we survived... so we've got a lot of information that we feel is imperative for a thorough investigation,"" he said. At the time, counsel to the inquiry Paul Greaney QC said many survivors would give evidence at the hearing and they were being encouraged to raise any issues with the inquiry team.

PM sets 15 October deadline for EU trade deal,"Finishing talks with the EU without striking a deal would still be a ""good outcome"", the PM will say Ministers are planning new legislation that could override a key part of last year's EU withdrawal agreement. The move could change the nature of new Northern Ireland customs arrangements intended to prevent a return to checks at the border with the Irish Republic. Downing Street said it was a standby plan in case EU-UK trade talks fail. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson said that, if a trade deal is not reached by 15 October, both sides should ""move on"", which would still be a ""good outcome"". Why Brexit is still a big issue Analysis: Fears for Brexit deal as talks near deadline What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Although the UK formally left the EU in January, it has continued to follow rules set in Brussels during a transition period - which ends on 31 December - while discussions over a long-term trade agreement continue. Another round of talks - the eighth - begins on Tuesday, aimed at securing a deal to allow companies to trade without taxes or customs checks. But Mr Johnson is expected to tell EU leaders it must be agreed in time for the European Council meeting on 15 October if it is to be in force by 1 January. ""If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,"" he will say. The UK has said it wantsa deal with the EU which resembles Canada's, which gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods traded. But Mr Johnson will say no deal means having a ""trading arrangement with the EU like Australia's"", using terms set by the World Trade Organisation. In practice, this would mean taxes on exports and customs checks. ""That would be a good outcome for the UK,"" the prime minister will say. During trade talks, the UK and EU have been at loggerheads over two issues in particular - the future of fisheries and state aid, the money given by governments to help companies. The EU says the UK is trying to give itself an unfair advantage by applying different rules on state aid, but the UK insists it should have control over this as a sovereign country. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, told French radio on Monday: ""The British would like the best of both worlds - export their products to the European market on their terms."" Meanwhile, the government will publish its Internal Market Bill - designed to protect trade arrangements between the four parts of the UK - on Wednesday. This could contradict the Northern Ireland Protocol, set up to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which many fear could be detrimental to peace. The protocol says Northern Ireland will follow some EU customs rules - meaning customs declarations for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, as well as some new checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland - after the transition period. The Financial Times,externalsaid the bill would ""eliminate"" the legal force of the Withdrawal Agreement, struck less than a year ago between the UK and EU, in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the proposed bill as an ""electrifying development in the Brexit process"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that she trusted the UK government ""to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law and prerequisite for any future partnership"". She added that the Northern Ireland Protocol was ""essential to protect peace and stability on the island and integrity of the single market"". By John Campbell, Northern Ireland economics and business editor The Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal, known as the protocol, was agreed in October last year. It is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland - or even any new checks at the Irish border. It does this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This will mean products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will be subject to new checks and controls - the so-called Irish Sea border. However the precise nature of these checks needs to be agreed by the EU and UK and this is being negotiated in parallel with the trade talks between the two. The government says it's still committed to the protocol but it could make its own decisions on how it is implemented if it cannot reach agreement with the EU. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Boris Johnson told us he had an oven-ready deal. And he fought a general election telling us he had an oven-ready deal. [This] now suggests that he was misleading people in that general election. ""And Parliament supported the Withdrawal Agreement earlier on this year. He has made promises and signed a treaty around these arrangements for Northern Ireland, and he now seems to be backing out of that."" Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltweeted,externalthat any threat of backtracking on the protocol would be a ""treacherous betrayal which would inflict irreversible harm on the all-Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid,externalthe move would ""significantly increase"" the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and the ""resulting damage to the economy will be entirely Tory-inflicted. What charlatans"". Government sources told the BBC the legislation was ""not intended to derail the talks"", and a spokeswoman said the UK would continue to approach talks with the EU in good faith. ""As a responsible government, we are considering fallback options in the event this is not achieved, to ensure the communities of Northern Ireland are protected,"" she said.

Policeman killed in 'terrorist' attack in Tunisia,"Security forces chased the attackers through the tourist areas of El Kantaoui Security officials in Tunisia say a police officer has been killed and another wounded in a knife attack in the coastal resort of Sousse. Three assailants were shot dead after the incident, which is being described as a terrorist attack. In 2015Sousse was the scene of one of Tunisia's worst attacks, when 38 people, most of them British tourists, were killed by a gunman. The latest incident comes two days after a new government was sworn in. The suspected militants rammed their vehicle into a National Guard checkpoint at a junction near the city's port. ""A patrol of two National Guard officers was attacked with a knife in the centre of Sousse,"" National Guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli said, according to the AFP news agency. ""One died as a martyr and the other was wounded and is hospitalised,"" he said. ""This was a terrorist attack"". The knifemen stole guns and a police vehicle during the attack before making off, Mr Jebabli said. Security forces took off after them through the tourist areas of El Kantaoui. ""In a firefight three terrorists were killed,"" he said, adding that two guns and the car were recovered. It is unclear if the assailants were tied to any particular extremist group, but the wider threat in Tunisia in recent years has been from dispersed sleeper cells composed of jihadists that returned from Syria, Libya, and Iraq, says the BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital Tunis. Thirty-eight people lost their lives when a gunman opened fire on tourists staying in El Kantaoui in June 2015. Thirty of those killed were British tourists staying at the Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba. The Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack by Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui. The situation in Tunisia has improved greatly since then, although a state of emergency is in place. Since 2015, successive governments have changed their counter-terrorism strategy by focusing more on prevention, rather than response, our reporter says. Countries like Germany and the UK have contributed to training security forces. This week Tunisia's parliament approved a new government formed by Prime Minister-designate Hichem Mechichi. Mr Mechichi appointed technocrats to his government rather than members of political parties as had been the case in the past.

Buttler batted throughout for his 77 from 54 balls as the hosts reached their target of 158 with seven balls left. After the loss of Jonny Bairstow, who hit his own wicket in the third over, Buttler batted patiently in a stand of 87 with Dawid Malan. Malan fell for 42, and Tom Banton and Eoin Morgan followed in a collapse of 3-29, but the assured Buttler held firm. With 18 needed from the final two overs, Moeen Ali hit 10 from two balls before Buttler sealed the victory with a huge six. A brilliant start with the ball by England - led by Jofra Archer and Mark Wood's searing pace - had earlier left Australia 3-2 and then 30-3, before the tourists scrapped to their total.

Here, when Malan holed out on the slog sweep at the end of an impressive knock, Banton top-edged to deep square leg and Morgan hit to extra cover, a similar twist was possible. However, Buttler provided what Australia lacked - a calm head to see the game home. He was not his attacking usual self for much of the innings. Although the right-hander found boundaries effectively with trademark reverse sweeps, England only took 44 from the first six overs of their chase.

One back-foot drive through the covers after the loss of Banton relieved pressure.

Finch played on to Jordan on 40, Stoinis departed for 35 when he edged Adil Rashid to slip and Glenn Maxwell became Jordan's second victim in the penultimate over after starting to find his range. The only negative from the bowling effort was that Archer's final over cost 18. He bowled three wides and was hit to six by Pat Cummins as Australia made it to a score that had looked beyond them. Still, Buttler ensured it was not enough. England captain Eoin Morgan:""When Jos Buttler is in the form he is, he really is one of the best players in the world.

"Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers sayBarristers warn thousands may wait until 2022 for justice despite a pledge to speed up the Crown Courts.UK","Hundreds of thousands of people may wait until 2022 for justice despite a government announcement to speed up work in the Crown Courts, lawyers warn. Ministers unveiled measures - including holding suspects for longer in England and Wales - in an attempt to manage pressure on courts amid the pandemic. But critics say delays in criminal courts are entirely of the government's making and pre-date coronavirus. More than 9,000 trials have been put back since the UK went into lockdown. What powers do the police have during the pandemic? Locations of the 'Nightingale courts' in England and Wales revealed Minister warns over court case backlog from virus On Sunday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it wants Parliament to pass temporary legislation to extend the time that defendants can be held in custody in England and Wales while awaiting trial. The law is one of the most important wheels of the criminal justice machine because it ensures that justice is as swift as possible for both suspects and victims. At present, defendants can only be held for 182 days after their first appearance in court, before there has to be an application to a judge to keep them inside for longer. Under the government's proposal, from the end of this month that will be two months longer. In practice, this decision builds more time into the court system - and it is part of a package of measures to manage the impact of coronavirus on the courts. The Ministry of Justice's main offices in Westminster will house a temporary court to ease the backlog Judges and court managers are struggling to find enough space to safely manage the social distancing of hundreds of people who would normally come into their buildings every day. But criminal barristers say that the government's case is disingenuous. They say the delays to justice are of the government's own making, not because of coronavirus. They accuse ministers of taking a political decision to introduce yet more delay - which could lead to cases collapsing if witnesses withdraw cooperation - rather than finding the cash to get more courts operational. According to official figures, more than37,000 Crown Court cases were outstanding before the pandemic struck,externalthe UK. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA), which represents barristers who prosecute and defend across the country, says the backlog is now 43,000. In recent years, the number of courtrooms in regular use has fallen as part of cuts to the courts budget - and as the number of sitting days has fallen, the backlog of cases has grown. James Mulholland QC, chairman of the CBA, said that the delays to justice were damaging to suspects, victims and witnesses. ""You don't resolve the delays by incorporating further delays into the system,"" he said. ""The people you punish unfairly by this mechanism are not only those wrongly accused of crime, because not everyone in custody is guilty - but the witnesses who will have to wait even longer to be heard."" ""The backlog could have gone away if the government had allowed judges to sit. Then along comes Covid, and the crisis that they've created, they can't properly address."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government's wider package of measures will get the criminal courts system ""back to where it needs to be"". ""This temporary extension to custody time limits will keep victims and the public safe, and we should not apologise for making that our priority,"" he said. ""At the same time, the measures I have announced today will get the criminal courts system back to where it needs to be - reducing delays and delivering speedier justice for all."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? The latest plan includes installing plastic screens in often cramped and confined courtrooms to help reduce the risk of virus spread. The government has already opened 10 ""Nightingale"" court sites - additional facilities to help manage the burden. But only two are dedicated to criminal work. The Ministry of Justice has now pledged an extra 1,600 court staff and Â£80m towards more Nightingale courts for crime. But barristers say the money being spent on warehousing defendants could be better spent on getting existing courts operational.

"Son sells 28 years of birthday whisky to buy houseMatthew Robson's quirky collection of presents from his father is now worth Â£40,000.Somerset","Matthew Robson was given a bottle of 18-year-old whisky every year for his birthday which is now worth Â£40,000 A man whose father gave him 18-year-old whisky every year for his birthday is selling the collection to buy a house. Matthew Robson, from Taunton, was born in 1992 and over the course of his life his father Pete has spent about Â£5,000 on 28 bottles of Macallan single malt. The collection is now worth more than Â£40,000 and has been put up for sale. The 28-year-old said it ""probably wasn't"" the best gift for a young boy but with ""strict instructions never to open them"" they had become a nest egg. Pete Robson said the whisky ""wasn't the only present"" he gave his son Matthew for his birthday Matthew said he was under ""strict instructions, never, never to open"" his whisky birthday presents ""Each year I received it as a birthday present,"" Matthew said. ""I thought it was quite a quirky little present as I was slightly too young to start drinking. ""But I was under strict instructions, never, never to open them and I tried my hardest and succeeded and they're all intact."" His father Pete, who is from Milnathort in Scotland, said the first bottle of 1974 whisky was bought to ""wet the baby's head"". ""I thought it would be interesting if I bought one every year and he'd end up with 18 bottles of 18-year-old whisky for his 18th birthday,"" he said. ""It wasn't the only present he got from us. It was just meant to be a unique present but it was a little bit of luck that we kept it going."" Whisky broker, Mark Littler, said has been ""a lot of interest already"" in the collection Since then, experts say Macallan has become collectable and Matthew is hoping to sell his collection for Â£40,000 and use the money for a house deposit. It is being sold by whisky broker Mark Littler, who has described it as a ""perfect set"". ""The value of Macallan has risen massively over the last five to 10 years,"" he said. ""To have such a vast collection of bottles is the real selling point of these."" He said there had been ""a lot of interest already"" in the collection, mostly from buyers in New York and Asia.

Young women and suicide: 'I felt like a shell',"When Lauren Watson was 24 years old, she thought she wanted to take her own life. She says grief and a ""toxic"" relationship after she had her daughter Codie at 16 left her struggling with her mental health. ""I didn't even feel like a human being,"" Lauren tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I felt like I was a shell, and someone had taken my soul and all of my organs out of me. I felt nothing. I didn't even feel like a person anymore."" Lauren and her daughter Codie When Lauren attempted to kill herself in August 2018, she survived. But others don't. New figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that across England and Wales, the number of women taking their own lives in 2019 was at its highest since 2004. Deaths of those in the age group 10 to 24 increased from 81 in 2012 to 159 last year. ""That figure doesn't surprise me at all,"" Lauren says. During lockdown, she and her friends went to local suicide spots and left notes with kind words on them. Lauren and her friends left notes in suicide spots ""We received a lot of messages from doing that, it made me realise a lot more people are suffering than we know. ""People that I knew personally, and never would've thought were having a hard time, were reaching out to say thank you."" Lauren says when she was at her lowest, she worried that opening up would make her look like she was ""attention seeking"". ""I felt like nobody would take me seriously, they'd just think I was having a bad day. ""But when I decided to speak to my friends and family, it made me feel so much better.""

Of the 5,691 people who took their own lives in England and Wales last year, about three quarters were men. The figures also show the suicide rate for men is at its highest for two decades. Throughout the pandemic, a number of charities have warned about the impact on mental health of added stress, with jobs and incomes up in the air, coupled with less socialising or being outdoors. There has also been a significant rise in the number of LGBTQ people seeking suicide prevention support during the UK's lockdown. Emma Carrington is a manager at Rethink, a charity that advises people who are feeling suicidal or struggling with mental illness. She says although it's important not to speculate about the reasons behind suicide rates, they have noticed more people calling for emotional support and advice about feeling lonely during lockdown. Two years on from Lauren's lowest point, she couldn't be more glad she survived. ""I learnt that it's a bad day, not a bad life,"" she says. Emma has four main pieces of advice she says she'd give to someone who is struggling: It can sometimes feel quite shameful when we have these thoughts and we feel like no one really cares. But actually, there are lots of people that do, whether that's friends, family, your GP or an advice line. It's about knowing what can make you feel worse. When we're down we do things like looking at the exes photos on Facebook, we listen to that sad song, we watch that movie that we used to watch with them, all those sorts of things. Don't do that! This is not a piece of advice that people always want to hear because when we're feeling low we often turn to this and feel better. But actually, they reduce our inhibitions. You are much more likely to act on suicidal thoughts if you're taking drugs or alcohol, so stay away from them. It can be a box,  a carrier bag or anything. It's something that you've put things in that make you feel better. It might be your favourite CD, a letter from someone you care about, your favourite jumper or chocolate bar, anything that makes you feel good. You can kind of pick it up when you're feeling really low as an act of self care. For information and support on mental health and suicide, access theBBC Action Line.

The first stabbing was in Constitution Hill at 00:30 BST then the killer moved south, apparently attacking at random, officers said. The stabbings did not appear terrorism related, gang related or connected to disorder, West Midlands Police said. Murder inquiry detectives said they were hunting a single suspect. Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"" The force urged anyone with CCTV or mobile footage to contact them. One man died, another man and a woman suffered critical injuries and five other people were left with non-life-threatening injuries. Ch Supt Steve Graham said the attacker went on to stab people in Livery Street, Irving Street and finally in Hurst Street, where the city's Gay Village meets the Chinese Quarter, at about 02:20 BST. Police said there was no evidence the stabbings were a hate crime. This video can not be played Nikita Denton told the BBC the victim she helped was alone and in a state of shock A woman who was out celebrating her 29th birthday described how she helped another woman who was ""on the street bleeding heavily"". Nikita Denton, of Edgbaston, said: ""My best friend Jay held her head and talked her through everything the whole time and wouldn't leave her side. ""She looked very dazed and confused, she couldn't talk. But she was talking to my friend with blinks."" When paramedics arrived they asked them for help. ""I got water and used the torch on my phone to help them see the wounds as they didn't have a torch at that time,"" she said. ""There were about four wounds."" She added: ""I'd hate to think if we weren't there that night as she would have been alone."" Police said it was ""not appropriate"" to speculate on the motivation Ch Supt Graham said officers - some armed - remained across the city centre to reassure people. He added they had received a number of descriptions of the suspect but would not be releasing any details for the time being. Follow live updates from the scene He said: ""The events during the early hours of this morning are tragic, shocking and understandably frightening. ""It does appear to be a random attack because we haven't found any links between the victims, either in their nature or in where they were socialising. ""Please be assured that we are doing absolutely everything we can to find whoever was responsible and try to understand what exactly happened."" Ch Supt Steve Graham said it was too early say whether a knife found in a city centre drain was connected to the murder inquiry Savvas Sfrantzis, who was working nearby, said he saw a man stab a girl multiple times but people thought at first he was trying to take her necklace. ""He was like very cold and he wasn't panicking and he wasn't reacting or anything. After he stabbed her between five and seven times... he walked off as if nothing has happened,"" he said. Officers earlier found a knife in a drain but Mr Graham said it was ""way too early"" to say if it was connected to the case. ""What I think it does suggest is the comprehensive nature of our inquiry - that already we've got people going down drains - we've got that level of detailed searches taking place,"" he said. David Nash, who was running the Village Inn in Hurst Street, said after a ""normal night"" he heard someone shout ""stop him - he's just stabbed somebody"" between 02:00 and 02:15. ""The bars were starting to wind down and the next thing we know the area is engulfed with armed response vehicles, normal police vehicles, police on foot, ambulances,"" he said. ""They just came from absolutely nowhere and the area was full of them and then the police helicopter was up."" He said he then saw paramedics treating two people who seemed to have been stabbed. This video can not be played Video posted on social media shows a number of emergency service vehicles, and parts of the city centre have been cordoned off Nathan Hudson, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said 14 ambulances attended and he was among 11 paramedic officers who were also sent to help. A team of St John Ambulance volunteers based at the Arcadian nightspot also treated casualties. The ""smirking"" attacker was seen walking past the Sidewalk nightclub shortly after stabbing at least two people further up the street Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"". He tweeted: ""All my thoughts are with those affected by the terrible incident in Birmingham last night."" Witness Cara Curran, a club promoter working in the Arcadian Centre, said it had been busier during the evening than it had been at any time since the start of lockdown. She said she had finished her shift at about 00:30 BST and was drinking with colleagues when she heard a ""loud bang and quite a lot of commotion"". Police set up a cordon at the junction of Hurst Street and Bromsgrove Street after the final stabbing The streets in the area had already been closed to traffic due to coronavirus restrictions. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) David Jamieson said police would be working with the council to see if there were ""any further measures that need to be taken in the city centre"", following the stabbings. A rise in violence was ""almost inevitable"" due to the pandemic, when people were suffering ""pent-up feelings"" and some were unsure of their futures, the Labour PCC said. Outside the cordoned-off area, much of the city centre, such as Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre and the Sealife Centre in Brindleyplace, is open as usual. Were you in the area?

"UK coronavirus cases rise sharply by 2,988","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We are concerned about this rise in cases"" A further 2,988 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the UK in the past 24 hours, government data showed. It is the highest number reported on a single day since 22 May and a rise of 1,175 on Saturday, according to the UK government'scoronavirus dashboard,external. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""concerned"" about a rise in cases ""predominantly among young people"". Two further deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, taking the total number of UK deaths to 41,551. Mr Hancock added: ""It's so important that everybody does their bit and follows the social distancing because it doesn't matter how old you are, how affected you might be by this disease, you can pass the disease on to others."" ""So don't pass the disease on to your grandparents if you're a young person, everybody needs to follow the social distancing."" Despite the sharp rise in cases, Mr Hancock said the government was right to reopen schools ""because of the impact on children of not getting an education"", adding that workplaces which have reopened are ""Covid-secure"". Scotland recorded 208 new cases on Sunday,its highest daily increase for more than 17 weeks. Wales recorded a further 98 cases, its highest daily rise since 30 June, and Northern Ireland recorded 106 new cases, its highest rise since 25 April. Overall, since the start of the pandemic, 347,152 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The number of daily reported cases has been rising steadily and some of that has been put down to an increase in the number of people being tested. Put simply, the more you test the more new cases you will find. But the jump of more than one thousand in a day is a significant new spike. The health secretary says the government is concerned and has renewed official calls for more vigilance on social distancing. What Matt Hancock and health officials are worried about is that the UK might follow the same path as France and Spain, where increases in infections amongst younger adults led after a few weeks to higher numbers of admissions to hospitals for older and more vulnerable patients. The number of people seriously ill in hospital with Covid-19 has fallen and there were just two new daily reported deaths. Medical leaders and ministers can only hope that the spread of the virus amongst younger people does not get passed on to the elderly and those with underlying health problems. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said ministers needed to ""set out what is being done to get testing back on track and bring case numbers down"". He said the increase in cases came on top of ""the ongoing testing fiasco where ill people are told to drive for miles for tests, and the poor performance of the contact tracing system"". Increased demand led bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system to apologiseafter it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up. Screening capacity was described last week as being ""maxed out"" - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again How do I get a coronavirus test? Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in outbreak response at the University of East Anglia, said some of the rise may be due to the system catching up after delays when it struggled to keep up with demand, but added it was still a ""marked increase"". ""Sadly it is beginning to look like we are moving into a period of exponential growth in the UK epidemic, and if so we can expect further increases over coming weeks,"" he said. Birmingham had the single largest increase in cases overnight, and the majority of new cases were in the north of England, said Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director. But she said no single area accounted for the overnight change, with broad increases in Covid-19 cases across England. The rise in positive tests came as tougher measures limiting household contacts were introduced in Boltonin an effort to stop coronavirus cases rising and prevent a full local lockdown. The infection rate in the area has risen to 99 cases per 100,000 people per week - the highest in England. Commenting on Scotland's increase, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""While this reflects the substantial opening up of the economy, it reminds us of the need to deploy counter measures."" She added that the ""first line of defence"" is to ""take greater care on face coverings, hygiene and distance"". SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, speaking earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the economy""needs to have people back at work"". Mr Raab acknowledged there was likely to be a ""bit more"" remote working in future. However, he added: ""It is important to send a message that we need to get Britain back up and running, the economy motoring on all cylinders."" Mr Raab also played down suggestions that coronavirus testing at airportswould help travellers avoid mandatory quarantine.

"UK 'not scared of walking away' from Brexit talksBritain will leave the transition arrangement in December ""come what may"", says David Frost.UK Politics","The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has said the government is not ""scared"" of walking away from talks without a trade deal ready to come into force in 2021. David Frost told the Mail on Sunday,externalthe UK would leave the transition arrangement - which sees it follow many EU rules - ""come what may"" in December. And Dominic Raab said the ""EU's best moment to strike a deal is now."" But EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""worried and disappointed"" by a lack of concessions from the UK. He was speaking after informal talks between the pair failed to find a breakthrough. An eighth round of formal negotiations begins on Tuesday. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Why Brexit is still a big issue May criticises PM for making Frost security adviser Both sides want a deal agreed next month in order to have it signed off by politicians on both sides of the Channel by the end of the transition period on 31 December. Differences remain on issues such as fishing and the level of taxpayer support the UK will be able to provide for businesses, also referred to as state aid rules. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the week ahead was ""a wake-up call for the EU"", adding ""the EU's best moment to strike a deal is now."" Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he said the questions of fishing and state aid were ""the only two points holding us back"". Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Barnier: UK risks no-deal unless it compromises On fishing, he accused the EU of wanting to keep UK access to its fishing waters ""permanently low"". He also said providing state aid is ""an absolute critical element of policy making"" which UK political representatives should have control over. The EU has said it wants full access for its boats to fish in UK waters in return for giving the UK fishing industry full access to EU markets. On state aid, the EU has expressed concern that it could give business in the UK an unfair advantage over their European competitors and Mr Barnier has previously said the EU will require ""robust"" guarantees in this area if it is to agree a deal.

Analysis by Chris Mason, Political Correspondent, BBC News The UK left the European Union in February but until the end of December it is in a transition period, where very little has actually changed. The time left to negotiate a long-term arrangement between London and Brussels is tight, and the language from Lord Frost is defiant. ""We are not going to be a client state,"" he says. ""We are not going to accept provisions that lock us into the way the EU do things."" While this is his first interview since the UK left the EU, officials in Brussels are familiar with his arguments. One described the remarks as ""unsurprising muscle-flexing"". Sources there say what they can't accept is the UK having the freedom to undercut businesses on the continent in their own single market. The time for compromise is running short. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but there's no guarantee it will. In the interview, Lord Frost said wanting control over the country's money and affairs ""should not be controversial"". ""That's what being an independent country is about, that's what the British people voted for and that's what will happen at the end of the year,"" he said. ""I don't think that we are scared of this at all. We want to get back the powers to control our borders and that is the most important thing."" The government was ""fully ready"" to trade with the EU without a formal deal, he said. In practice, this would mean taxes on exports and customs checks. It's a scenario which road hauliers say would cause ""severe"" disruption to supply chains, with border management systems not yet up and running to make sure consignments are cleared to proceed to the EU. Last week, theRoad Haulage Association said the UK was ""sleepwalking into a disaster"". Labour's shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said ""It would be the clearest evidence yet of this government's monumental incompetence if we ended the transition period without negotiating a trade deal with our most important market. ""As we enter an economic recession, ministers need to get a grip, support UK jobs and industries and deliver the trade deal with the EU they promised the British public."" Speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey accused the government of being ""very reckless"" and said failing to reach a deal with the EU would be ""a disaster for people's jobs"". And Gavin Barwell, chief of staff under Theresa May, hit back at Lord Frost's suggestion that the former prime minister's team ""blinked"" during EU negotiations tweeting: ""Given the withdrawal agreement and political declaration David Frost negotiated last autumn were 95% the work of his predecessors - and the 5% that was new involved giving in to the EU's key demand (for some customs processes when goods move GB to NI) - that quote's some brass neck.""

Son sells 28 years of birthday whisky to buy house,"Matthew Robson was given a bottle of 18-year-old whisky every year for his birthday which is now worth Â£40,000 A man whose father gave him 18-year-old whisky every year for his birthday is selling the collection to buy a house. Matthew Robson, from Taunton, was born in 1992 and over the course of his life his father Pete has spent about Â£5,000 on 28 bottles of Macallan single malt. The collection is now worth more than Â£40,000 and has been put up for sale. The 28-year-old said it ""probably wasn't"" the best gift for a young boy but with ""strict instructions never to open them"" they had become a nest egg. Pete Robson said the whisky ""wasn't the only present"" he gave his son Matthew for his birthday Matthew said he was under ""strict instructions, never, never to open"" his whisky birthday presents ""Each year I received it as a birthday present,"" Matthew said. ""I thought it was quite a quirky little present as I was slightly too young to start drinking. ""But I was under strict instructions, never, never to open them and I tried my hardest and succeeded and they're all intact."" His father Pete, who is from Milnathort in Scotland, said the first bottle of 1974 whisky was bought to ""wet the baby's head"". ""I thought it would be interesting if I bought one every year and he'd end up with 18 bottles of 18-year-old whisky for his 18th birthday,"" he said. ""It wasn't the only present he got from us. It was just meant to be a unique present but it was a little bit of luck that we kept it going."" Whisky broker, Mark Littler, said has been ""a lot of interest already"" in the collection Since then, experts say Macallan has become collectable and Matthew is hoping to sell his collection for Â£40,000 and use the money for a house deposit. It is being sold by whisky broker Mark Littler, who has described it as a ""perfect set"". ""The value of Macallan has risen massively over the last five to 10 years,"" he said. ""To have such a vast collection of bottles is the real selling point of these."" He said there had been ""a lot of interest already"" in the collection, mostly from buyers in New York and Asia.

Protesters defy heavy security in Belarus,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Hundreds of people have been arrested in Belarus following a fourth consecutive weekend of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. At least 633 people were detained during the unrest, the interior ministry said on Monday. Thousands more defied heavy security and rallied in the capital Minsk, where troops and water cannon were deployed. The demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after his re-election last month amid allegations of ballot-rigging. Mass unrest since then has seen at least four people killed and hundreds injured as the government tries to stamp out dissent. A number of opposition figures have fled the country. On Saturday, activist Olga Kovalkova became the latest to say she had taken refuge in neighbouring Poland amid threats of imprisonment. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest 'We can breathe for the first time in our lives' Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has accused Western nations of interfering. Protesters, human rights activists and observers say riot police are brutally suppressing peaceful marches in the former Soviet republic. Belarus borders Russia, on which it depends heavily for energy and with which it historically has close ties, as well as Ukraine and EU states. The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the republic. It said some 363 people had been sent to detention centres pending court hearings. Eyewitnesses told Russia's Interfax news agency that police began to make arrests in Minsk after the unsanctioned rally ended and people were going home. Video footage on Sunday shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. Protesters were chased with batons in Minsk Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces. ""They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Belta news agency. Sunday has become the key day for street demonstrations since the rallies began. In recent days, the security forces - dressed all in black with balaclavas over their faces - targeted university students as they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans. Protesters streamed through Minsk One protester in Minsk, who gave her name as Lyudmila, told the BBC earlier that the demonstrators were undeterred by the security forces. ""We are definitely not ready to get back to the life we had for many years now,"" she said. ""We finally feel like we matter because we've been living in apathy for way too long and now we just have this feeling of solidarity and we actually think that - well, I feel personally that - changes already are happening so that's definitely not the time to give up."" Protests have also been reported in other Belarusian cities and towns including Grodno, Mogilev and Gomel. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk Sunday's rally had several phases. The first was the tense and uncertain. Security forces had used razor wire to close off the obvious gathering points, Minsk's main monuments and squares, and were standing guard behind them. Would-be protesters stood awkwardly on street corners wondering where and when the march would start. Those in small groups were vulnerable and we watched as a man holding the outlawed red and white flag of the opposition was dragged into a car by security officers and driven away. Then, as the numbers grew, there were nervy stand-offs near Independence Square. As they grew in confidence the demonstrators approached, berating the riot police at the barricades that now blocked the road. At about 16:00 the crowd swelled exponentially as people marched out of the centre. This was no longer the brave early arrivals, it was Belarusians young and old. Some were in fancy dress, others wearing clothes that directly mocked the riot police, the Omon. There were families, children, dogs - someone even brought a goose. For the fourth Sunday in a row President Lukashenko's attempts to stop the protest against him failed. The activist said she had left for Poland as she would have faced a long jail term had she not agreed to leave Belarus. Ms Kovalkova said security forces had driven her to a border post where she was able to board a bus to Poland after the driver recognised her. A spokesman for Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country would offer support to victims of repression in Belarus. Opposition activist Olga Kovalkova (seen here on 22 August) has now left Belarus On Friday,opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has sought refuge in Lithuania, urged the UN to help halt the authorities' crackdown on protesters. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, represented the chief opposition to Mr Lukashenko in the election, entering the presidential race after her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, and another candidate were jailed. She said the opposition was demanding an end to the police violence, the immediate release of all political prisoners, and a free and fair election.

The families searching for answers,"This video can not be played Lisa Roussos: ''It should be about transparency'' Lisa and Andrew Roussos say they feel as though they are stuck in May 2017. That's when their eight-year-old daughter Saffie was killed in the Manchester Arena bombing. Saffie was the youngest victim of the attack. A little girl with striking big eyes and a mane of dark hair, who loved dancing and making people laugh. Lisa and Andrew say she was a real live-wire who ""never sat still"". The pain of her loss is as great as ever. ""It's not something you get over, ever,"" Lisa says. ""Every morning you wake up. It happens again. She died that day, every day. ""That's just how it is. And we have to live with that."" Now the Roussos family and the other families bereaved that night are steeling themselves for a difficult few months. The public inquiry into the bombing, which starts hearing evidence on Monday, will examine every aspect of the attack, including whether it could have been prevented, the emergency response and the experiences of each of the 22 people who died. Saffie's parents say they still feel too raw to hear information about her last moments. ""I don't want to know about her injuries and what she went through,"" Lisa says. ""It's painful enough without knowing the details."" But the couple do have a lot of other questions which they want answers to. Andrew says the attack ""could have been prevented, it could have been stopped and Saffie and the others could have been here with us"". ""And that's what we want out of it,"" he says. ""To find out why there were so many wrongs."" Referring to the way the emergency services responded to the attack, Lisa adds: ""It was just complete chaos, nobody had a clue what to do, how to react. ""It was just a complete shambles. For those people that did make mistakes, the police, fire service, MI5, for them to admit their mistakes I think would be a good thing for them, as well as us."" Saffie's Ariana Grande ticket was a treasured Christmas present. She went to the concert with her big sister Ashlee and their mum Lisa. Andrew came to collect them, with Saffie's 11-year-old brother Xander and the family's pet chihuahua Binky in tow. By chance, a press photographer took some pictures of Andrew and Xander outside the arena, in the aftermath of the bomb. You can see the shock and bewilderment on their faces, Xander clutching the dog as his father searched for his wife and children. They came across Ashlee, sitting on the pavement outside the arena. She was bleeding but conscious, and being looked after by members of the public. Reassured by this, Andrew carried on looking for Lisa and Saffie. He says: ""It was just like a horror movie, there were kids screaming there were kids injured on the floor. ""There were people around and they were all crying, it was just... I have no words."" Andrew feels that the police were not in command. ""I asked every police officer that I went past,"" he says. ""They just said just keep looking. ""Nobody had control of it, because nobody gave me any indication of what to do, where the injured were. ""Nobody said to me, 'right stay here, let me make some phone calls let me get in touch with some people and see'. They just left you to just wander round."" Andrew and Xander spent all night searching. Eight-year-old Saffie Roussos was the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack They thought all of the injured had been brought out of the arena and had no idea that Lisa and Saffie were on the floor of the foyer just yards away from them. Andrew says: ""My daughter and my wife were lying on this floor. Do you know how that feels? ""I could have been with them, particularly Saffie. I could have been holding her hand, instead of a stranger. Imagine how she was feeling lying there?"" Father and son went to three hospitals before they found Lisa the next morning. Andrew says: ""They told me to prepare for the worst. If she was going to make it there was an 80-90% chance of her being paralysed from the neck down."" Andrew was exhausted and already at rock bottom. But he still had hopes of finding Saffie alive. He'd heard that children who were displaced at the arena were sheltering in nearby hotels. He grabbed a police officer at the hospital and pleaded again for information. Eventually it came. Fourteen hours after the explosion Andrew learned that Saffie was dead. After multiple operations, Lisa Roussos has defied the doctors' prediction of paralysis. She is a gentle person with calm determination - and she rarely talks publicly about the horrors of the attack. She tells me: ""The worst thing for me was - is - if Saffie could have been saved."" I ask her if it's something that she plays over in her head? ""I have done, yeah,"" she says. ""To think that, not just Saffie, the other people. How could they leave injured people in the arena for hours? It's just madness. ""I remember lying there thinking help will be here soon, and in the end it felt like I was lying there for hours. [I thought] 'why is nobody coming?'"" The Roussos family also have many questions for the security service MI5. They want to hear the detail of what was known about the bomber Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem who helped to build the bomb. But some of the hearings involving MI5 will be held behind closed doors, without the families or their lawyers expected to be present. They're being restricted on grounds of national security. Lisa says: ""Obviously you're having to put your full trust in the (inquiry) chairman. But this inquiry is not about trust, it should be about transparency, and I feel that we won't get that without having a representative in the room."" Andrew adds: ""We've got five or six law firms representing all the families, so let's have one barrister from each firm in that room. ""All I hear is lessons learned, but lessons haven't been learned, and lessons will never be learned, unless we get that transparency and honesty from the people involved to get the answers that we need.""

Protesters defy heavy security in BelarusTens of thousands gather as another top opposition activist says she has been forced to leave the country.Europe,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Hundreds of people have been arrested in Belarus following a fourth consecutive weekend of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. At least 633 people were detained during the unrest, the interior ministry said on Monday. Thousands more defied heavy security and rallied in the capital Minsk, where troops and water cannon were deployed. The demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after his re-election last month amid allegations of ballot-rigging. Mass unrest since then has seen at least four people killed and hundreds injured as the government tries to stamp out dissent. A number of opposition figures have fled the country. On Saturday, activist Olga Kovalkova became the latest to say she had taken refuge in neighbouring Poland amid threats of imprisonment. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest 'We can breathe for the first time in our lives' Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has accused Western nations of interfering. Protesters, human rights activists and observers say riot police are brutally suppressing peaceful marches in the former Soviet republic. Belarus borders Russia, on which it depends heavily for energy and with which it historically has close ties, as well as Ukraine and EU states. The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the republic. It said some 363 people had been sent to detention centres pending court hearings. Eyewitnesses told Russia's Interfax news agency that police began to make arrests in Minsk after the unsanctioned rally ended and people were going home. Video footage on Sunday shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. Protesters were chased with batons in Minsk Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces. ""They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Belta news agency. Sunday has become the key day for street demonstrations since the rallies began. In recent days, the security forces - dressed all in black with balaclavas over their faces - targeted university students as they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans. Protesters streamed through Minsk One protester in Minsk, who gave her name as Lyudmila, told the BBC earlier that the demonstrators were undeterred by the security forces. ""We are definitely not ready to get back to the life we had for many years now,"" she said. ""We finally feel like we matter because we've been living in apathy for way too long and now we just have this feeling of solidarity and we actually think that - well, I feel personally that - changes already are happening so that's definitely not the time to give up."" Protests have also been reported in other Belarusian cities and towns including Grodno, Mogilev and Gomel. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk Sunday's rally had several phases. The first was the tense and uncertain. Security forces had used razor wire to close off the obvious gathering points, Minsk's main monuments and squares, and were standing guard behind them. Would-be protesters stood awkwardly on street corners wondering where and when the march would start. Those in small groups were vulnerable and we watched as a man holding the outlawed red and white flag of the opposition was dragged into a car by security officers and driven away. Then, as the numbers grew, there were nervy stand-offs near Independence Square.

"Scotland records highest daily Covid tally since MayMore than 200 cases of Covid-19 are confirmed in 24 hours, the highest daily increase in Scotland for nearly three months.","Scotland has recorded its highest daily increase in coronavirus cases since May. A total of 208 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the 24 hours to Sunday compared with 141 cases on Saturday. Despite the rise, there were no reported deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus in the past 28 days. The figures showed the biggest rise in cases in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, where 92 cases were reported. Restrictions on people visiting other households were reintroduced in Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire on2 September after concerns about the number of cases. Glasgow KFC branch closes after virus outbreak Coronavirus detected at schools in Paisley and Glasgow Lanarkshire 'very close' to further restrictions Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said a meeting to discuss the restrictions in the west of Scotland took place on Sunday. He said: ""We always said when we introduced these local authority restrictions we would review them in a week but we expected them to be in place for two weeks. ""So the beginning of this week will be an opportunity to think should we extend them? Have we got the balance and proportionality correct? ""Today we think that is true, but we have to reserve judgment about whether we will still think that is true tomorrow or Tuesday."" A branch of KFC in Glasgow has been closed as a precaution after six members of staff tested positive for coronavirus The 2.3% rate of positive tests among newly tested individuals is up from 1.5% on Saturday, and the highest rate since 4 June.Â In response to the figures, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that they should ""remind us of the need to deploy strong counter measures"". She said this was a moment to take note and act in a way that prevents spread and said that the rise in cases had not been matched by a rise in hospital ICU admissions and deaths. But she warned: ""That's good news, but we mustn't be complacent about it. It could be a time lag - some countries, eg France, that have cases rising for longer are seeing these indications rise too."" Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions gathered in Edinburgh Ms Sturgeon also said that comparisons with earlier in year ""need a bit of context"" and said there was likely to have been a much bigger underestimate of true prevalence of the virus then. The rise in cases comes after protesters opposed to Covid-19restrictions gathered in their hundreds in Edinburghon Saturday. Coronavirus sceptics, vaccine conspiracy theorists and those opposed to mandatory mask-wearing staged a rally at Holyrood. The latest figures show NHS Grampian, where the Aberdeen bar cluster was identified last month, has recorded an increase of 14 new cases - a rise from the two announced on Saturday. There have also been 30 new cases in the NHS Lanarkshire area. The health board there indicated on Fridaythat some restrictions could be imposed due to a recent rise in infections. A total of 18 positive tests were registered by NHS Lothian, 11 cases have been discovered in Ayrshire and Arran, four in the Borders, three in Dumfries and Galloway, eight in Fife, 14 in the Forth Valley, six in the Highlands, and eight in Tayside. No new cases were discovered in Shetland, Orkney or the Western Isles. The 92 cases confirmed in Glasgow were revealed after it emerged aKFC restaurant in the city's Pollokshaws Road was shut for two weeksas a precaution after six members of staff tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile, one of the Scottish government's coronavirus advisors has said the UK government's plan to encourage workers to return to the office at the same time as reopening schools is jeopardising the test and trace system's ability to cope. Professor Devi Sridhar, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""What we've seen in Scotland over the past few weeks is the testing system has just been really having to race to catch up with the demand of all the children coming home with coughs and colds and fevers.""

"UK coronavirus cases rise by 2,988The increase is the highest number of positive tests since 22 May, with two further deaths recorded.UK","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We are concerned about this rise in cases"" A further 2,988 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the UK in the past 24 hours, government data showed. It is the highest number reported on a single day since 22 May and a rise of 1,175 on Saturday, according to the UK government'scoronavirus dashboard,external. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""concerned"" about a rise in cases ""predominantly among young people"". Two further deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, taking the total number of UK deaths to 41,551. Mr Hancock added: ""It's so important that everybody does their bit and follows the social distancing because it doesn't matter how old you are, how affected you might be by this disease, you can pass the disease on to others."" ""So don't pass the disease on to your grandparents if you're a young person, everybody needs to follow the social distancing."" Despite the sharp rise in cases, Mr Hancock said the government was right to reopen schools ""because of the impact on children of not getting an education"", adding that workplaces which have reopened are ""Covid-secure"". Scotland recorded 208 new cases on Sunday,its highest daily increase for more than 17 weeks. Wales recorded a further 98 cases, its highest daily rise since 30 June, and Northern Ireland recorded 106 new cases, its highest rise since 25 April. Overall, since the start of the pandemic, 347,152 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The number of daily reported cases has been rising steadily and some of that has been put down to an increase in the number of people being tested. Put simply, the more you test the more new cases you will find. But the jump of more than one thousand in a day is a significant new spike. The health secretary says the government is concerned and has renewed official calls for more vigilance on social distancing. What Matt Hancock and health officials are worried about is that the UK might follow the same path as France and Spain, where increases in infections amongst younger adults led after a few weeks to higher numbers of admissions to hospitals for older and more vulnerable patients. The number of people seriously ill in hospital with Covid-19 has fallen and there were just two new daily reported deaths. Medical leaders and ministers can only hope that the spread of the virus amongst younger people does not get passed on to the elderly and those with underlying health problems. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said ministers needed to ""set out what is being done to get testing back on track and bring case numbers down"". He said the increase in cases came on top of ""the ongoing testing fiasco where ill people are told to drive for miles for tests, and the poor performance of the contact tracing system"". Increased demand led bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system to apologiseafter it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up. Screening capacity was described last week as being ""maxed out"" - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again How do I get a coronavirus test? Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in outbreak response at the University of East Anglia, said some of the rise may be due to the system catching up after delays when it struggled to keep up with demand, but added it was still a ""marked increase"". ""Sadly it is beginning to look like we are moving into a period of exponential growth in the UK epidemic, and if so we can expect further increases over coming weeks,"" he said. Birmingham had the single largest increase in cases overnight, and the majority of new cases were in the north of England, said Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director. But she said no single area accounted for the overnight change, with broad increases in Covid-19 cases across England. The rise in positive tests came as tougher measures limiting household contacts were introduced in Boltonin an effort to stop coronavirus cases rising and prevent a full local lockdown. The infection rate in the area has risen to 99 cases per 100,000 people per week - the highest in England. Commenting on Scotland's increase, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""While this reflects the substantial opening up of the economy, it reminds us of the need to deploy counter measures."" She added that the ""first line of defence"" is to ""take greater care on face coverings, hygiene and distance"". SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, speaking earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the economy""needs to have people back at work"". Mr Raab acknowledged there was likely to be a ""bit more"" remote working in future. However, he added: ""It is important to send a message that we need to get Britain back up and running, the economy motoring on all cylinders."" Mr Raab also played down suggestions that coronavirus testing at airportswould help travellers avoid mandatory quarantine.

What Matt Hancock and health officials are worried about is that the UK might follow the same path as France and Spain, where increases in infections amongst younger adults led after a few weeks to higher numbers of admissions to hospitals for older and more vulnerable patients. The number of people seriously ill in hospital with Covid-19 has fallen and there were just two new daily reported deaths. Medical leaders and ministers can only hope that the spread of the virus amongst younger people does not get passed on to the elderly and those with underlying health problems. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said ministers needed to ""set out what is being done to get testing back on track and bring case numbers down"". He said the increase in cases came on top of ""the ongoing testing fiasco where ill people are told to drive for miles for tests, and the poor performance of the contact tracing system"". Increased demand led bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system to apologiseafter it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up. Screening capacity was described last week as being ""maxed out"" - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again How do I get a coronavirus test? Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in outbreak response at the University of East Anglia, said some of the rise may be due to the system catching up after delays when it struggled to keep up with demand, but added it was still a ""marked increase"". ""Sadly it is beginning to look like we are moving into a period of exponential growth in the UK epidemic, and if so we can expect further increases over coming weeks,"" he said. Birmingham had the single largest increase in cases overnight, and the majority of new cases were in the north of England, said Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director. But she said no single area accounted for the overnight change, with broad increases in Covid-19 cases across England. The rise in positive tests came as tougher measures limiting household contacts were introduced in Boltonin an effort to stop coronavirus cases rising and prevent a full local lockdown. The infection rate in the area has risen to 99 cases per 100,000 people per week - the highest in England. Commenting on Scotland's increase, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""While this reflects the substantial opening up of the economy, it reminds us of the need to deploy counter measures."" She added that the ""first line of defence"" is to ""take greater care on face coverings, hygiene and distance"". SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Meanwhile, speaking earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the economy""needs to have people back at work"". Mr Raab acknowledged there was likely to be a ""bit more"" remote working in future. However, he added: ""It is important to send a message that we need to get Britain back up and running, the economy motoring on all cylinders."" Mr Raab also played down suggestions that coronavirus testing at airportswould help travellers avoid mandatory quarantine.

Helicopters rescue US campers trapped by fire,"This video can not be played The Creek Fire has swept across thousands of acres in the Sierra National Forest Helicopters have rescued more than 200 people trapped after a wildfire set 45,000 acres alight and cut off a popular reservoir in California, officials say. About 20 of the people were hurt, some with burns. The Creek Fire began on Friday in the Sierra National Forest, cutting off the Mammoth Pool Reservoir, 40 miles (60km) north-east of Fresno. The temperature has hit 47C (117F), part of a record heatwave in the state. On Sunday, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in five Californian counties - Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, San Bernardino and San Diego - because of the wildfires. The fast-moving Creek Fire started at about 18:45 on Friday (01:45 GMT on Saturday) in the forest, an area of steep and rugged terrain. National forest spokesman Dan Tune said he did not know how close the fire was to the campsite, a popular boating and fishing destination.

'Spend time on sport rather than weighing kids',"Elinor Barker won gold in the team pursuit at the 2016 Rio Olympics Cyclist Elinor Barker has said time spent weighing children at school after lockdown would be better used helping them find a sport they love. The Olympic gold medallist from Cardiff said she had seen athletes starve and dehydrate themselves the day before being weighed for competitions. Her comments came after the National Obesity Forum's Tam Fry suggested checking children's weight this month. He said weighing already happens and it would help pick up obesity early. Ms Barker, 25, first outlined her viewson Twitter,externalafter Mr Fry and other health experts said they wanted weigh-ins in September, and again in the spring, to keep kids on track. She posted: ""I've seen a lot of educated, professional athletes basically starve themselves, completely dehydrate themselves the day before they've got a body comp in which we all get weighed."" Body composition analysis is a way of examining what the body is formed of; by differentiating between fat, protein, minerals, and water a snapshot of health can be seen. ""I just don't think that shame is the way forward whatsoever,"" she said, speaking later to the BBC. ""I really think that time could be used to find sports that kids enjoy. ""Because you need to enjoy it and build it into a healthy lifestyle, you need to find something that you love. ""And I think a lot of kids don't enjoy PE because there's a lot of hand-eye co-ordination involved, a lot of competition involved in football, netball, rugby - the kind of sports you see during school."" 'Cheap junk food to blame' for obesity 'End Bogof deals' to cut food waste Call for sugar tax cash to go to the Welsh NHS Elinor Barker said sport needed to be ""a lifestyle"" as ""diets don't work"" She said young people who did not enjoy these sports could learn about ones they might, including less-accessible sports such as ""canoeing or badminton or rock climbing"". ""Or any of the hundreds of sports that there are that you can get involved in,"" said Ms Barker. Sport, she added, needed to be ""a lifestyle"" as ""diets don't work"". She said there had not been a set of scales in her childhood home. When a number becomes ""the most important thing"", reason can go ""out of the window"", she added. ""Not having a number to track and not knowing even what I should weigh or what I had previously weighed, or anything like that, I think was super helpful in trying to just keep a healthy mindset I think,"" she said. Lockdown and weight gain â should you worry? Poor pupils face 'two-year catch up after lockdown' Mr Fry denied his suggestion of checking on school children's weight after the pandemic in any way amounted to ""fat shaming"". He insisted children should be measured ""routinely"" in school to identify excess weight gain before it became a problem. ""Measuring height and weight should always be privately carried out in the school medical room and recorded or charted by the school nurse, doctor, etc,"" he said. ""The data should then inform medical intervention and the family. He saidchild measurement programmes,externalhad been conducted in schools since 2005, adding they were a ""vital resource"" in knowing the health of UK children. Because of lockdown ""we have no idea"" how the pandemic has affected children's weight, he said. ""My call to get children measured when they return to school would go towards rectifying that."" Mr Fry said he was ""absolutely sure"" obesity rates would rise because of lockdown. ""One thousand under-fours were treated for obesity in hospital last year because their weight gain was not picked up, and 25% of primary school entrants are overweight or obese,"" he said.

Class of 21 self-isolate after positive Covid test,"St Gwladys Primary School will remain open despite the positive test A class of 21 pupils has been told to self-isolate for two weeks after a member of staff at their school tested positive for Covid-19. The pupils at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed, Caerphilly, must stay at home for 14 days, although the rest of the school will remain open. ""We fully appreciate this will cause concern to parents and children at the school,"" a council spokesman said. Caerphilly has seen 78 cases in the past week, the highest number in Wales. A walk-in test centre opened outside Caerphilly Leisure Centre on Saturday for people with symptoms to get tested. The school and council said the parents of all the affected children had been contacted and they are working with the contact tracing system to protect other pupils and the wider community. Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' Four school staff test positive for Covid-19 ""We can confirm that a member of staff at the school has tested positive for coronavirus,"" a council spokesman said. ""It has been agreed, following advice from Public Health Wales, that 21 pupils from one class will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. ""It is important to note that all safety measures are in place throughout the school and that they are being followed strictly to limit any cross-contamination. ""The school remains open and it is not necessary for any other child to self-isolate, stay away from school or to be tested, unless they develop symptoms of Covid-19."" A temporary test centre is open outside the town's leisure centre daily until Tuesday at 18:00 BST Residents have been warned to increase social distancing to avoid ""another harsh lockdown"" following the spike in cases.

Musical work changes chord after seven-year wait,"This video can not be played Music fans gather in a church to hear a chord change in a composition meant to last 639 years Fans have flocked to a church in Germany to hear a chord change in a musical composition that lasts for 639 years. It is the first change in the piece, As Slow As Possible, in seven years. The work is by the avant-garde American composer, John Cage. It began 19 years ago with a pause lasting nearly 18 months. The change of chord took place on the specially built organ on which the composition is being performed. The Saint Burchardi Church in the city of Halberstadt started playing the music in 2001 and the last note change took place in 2013. The music As Slow As Possible will end in 2640 Fans queue for the chord change The score is made up of eight pages of music, to be played at the piano or organ - very slowly. But the wait for the next scheduled chord change will be quick in comparison - with 5 February 2022 slated as the date. The piece will end in 2640. Cage, who died in 1992 at the age of 79, wrote the piece in the 1980s. The composer is arguably most famous for 4'33"". The three-movement composition from 1952 is for any combination of instruments, but instructs performers not to play them. Listeners instead hear the sound of the surrounding environment during the four minutes and 33 seconds the work lasts.

Protesters defy heavy security in BelarusThousands gather as another top opposition activist says she has been forced to leave the country.Europe,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Hundreds of people have been arrested in Belarus following a fourth consecutive weekend of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. At least 633 people were detained during the unrest, the interior ministry said on Monday. Thousands more defied heavy security and rallied in the capital Minsk, where troops and water cannon were deployed. The demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after his re-election last month amid allegations of ballot-rigging. Mass unrest since then has seen at least four people killed and hundreds injured as the government tries to stamp out dissent. A number of opposition figures have fled the country. On Saturday, activist Olga Kovalkova became the latest to say she had taken refuge in neighbouring Poland amid threats of imprisonment. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest 'We can breathe for the first time in our lives' Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has accused Western nations of interfering. Protesters, human rights activists and observers say riot police are brutally suppressing peaceful marches in the former Soviet republic. Belarus borders Russia, on which it depends heavily for energy and with which it historically has close ties, as well as Ukraine and EU states. The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the republic. It said some 363 people had been sent to detention centres pending court hearings. Eyewitnesses told Russia's Interfax news agency that police began to make arrests in Minsk after the unsanctioned rally ended and people were going home. Video footage on Sunday shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. Protesters were chased with batons in Minsk Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces. ""They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Belta news agency. Sunday has become the key day for street demonstrations since the rallies began. In recent days, the security forces - dressed all in black with balaclavas over their faces - targeted university students as they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans. Protesters streamed through Minsk One protester in Minsk, who gave her name as Lyudmila, told the BBC earlier that the demonstrators were undeterred by the security forces. ""We are definitely not ready to get back to the life we had for many years now,"" she said. ""We finally feel like we matter because we've been living in apathy for way too long and now we just have this feeling of solidarity and we actually think that - well, I feel personally that - changes already are happening so that's definitely not the time to give up."" Protests have also been reported in other Belarusian cities and towns including Grodno, Mogilev and Gomel. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk Sunday's rally had several phases. The first was the tense and uncertain. Security forces had used razor wire to close off the obvious gathering points, Minsk's main monuments and squares, and were standing guard behind them. Would-be protesters stood awkwardly on street corners wondering where and when the march would start. Those in small groups were vulnerable and we watched as a man holding the outlawed red and white flag of the opposition was dragged into a car by security officers and driven away. Then, as the numbers grew, there were nervy stand-offs near Independence Square. As they grew in confidence the demonstrators approached, berating the riot police at the barricades that now blocked the road. At about 16:00 the crowd swelled exponentially as people marched out of the centre. This was no longer the brave early arrivals, it was Belarusians young and old. Some were in fancy dress, others wearing clothes that directly mocked the riot police, the Omon. There were families, children, dogs - someone even brought a goose. For the fourth Sunday in a row President Lukashenko's attempts to stop the protest against him failed. The activist said she had left for Poland as she would have faced a long jail term had she not agreed to leave Belarus. Ms Kovalkova said security forces had driven her to a border post where she was able to board a bus to Poland after the driver recognised her. A spokesman for Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country would offer support to victims of repression in Belarus. Opposition activist Olga Kovalkova (seen here on 22 August) has now left Belarus On Friday,opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has sought refuge in Lithuania, urged the UN to help halt the authorities' crackdown on protesters. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, represented the chief opposition to Mr Lukashenko in the election, entering the presidential race after her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, and another candidate were jailed. She said the opposition was demanding an end to the police violence, the immediate release of all political prisoners, and a free and fair election. Last month,EU leaders agreed to impose sanctions,external- including asset freezes - on as yet unnamed Belarusian officials involved in alleged election-rigging, brutality and imprisonment of protesters. The exact sanctions are still being worked out. The UN special rapporteur on Belarus, Anais Marin, said Mr Lukashenko's re-election as president was ""completely manipulated"" and ""people's votes were stolen"". This video can not be played A 73-year-old great-grandmother has turned into an unlikely hero for demonstrators in Belarus She accused the Belarus police of torture, citing as one example a 16-year-old who was ""so badly beaten up he was left in a coma"". ""The authorities must release all those arbitrarily arrested,"" she said. ""The government is waging an insane war against its own people."" Mr Lukashenko has denied any allegations of vote-rigging. He has blamed some EU nations, in particular Poland and Lithuania, of trying to force regime change. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. This video can not be played Lukashenko leaves helicopter wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle On Thursday, he indicated he was open to moving closer to Russia, saying the protests had ""prompted us to make relevant conclusions"".

Melbourne coronavirus lockdown extended,"A second lockdown is currently in place in Melbourne and its surrounding areas A strict lockdown in the Australian city of Melbourne has been extended by two weeks, with officials saying new Covid-19 cases had not dropped enough. Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said the restrictions would be in place until 28 September, with a slight relaxation. A gradual easing of the measures will be implemented from October. The state has been the epicentre of the country's second wave, accounting for 90% of Australia's 753 deaths. Australia has recorded a total of 26,000 cases in a population of 25 million. The greater Melbourne area entered a second lockdown on 9 July after a rise in cases. A 5km (3 mile) travel limit and night time curfew was imposed while shops and businesses were closed. The current stage four lockdown was originally set to end on 13 September. Melbourne's curfew will be expanded from 21:00 to 05:00. Single people will be allowed to form a bubble and visit each other, and the current travel limit will not apply to these meetings. ""There is only one option and that is to do this in a series of steady and safe steps. You can't run out of lockdown. Because all you are doing is running into a third wave and we'll all be locked up again,"" Mr Andrews said at a news conference. ""We can't open up at this time. If we were to we would lose control very quickly... I want a Christmas that is as close to normal as possible and this is the only way, these steps are the only way that we will get to that point."" Mr Andrews said the state needed to ""open up in a safe and steady way"" If the daily average number of cases are between 30 and 50 by 28 September, the city will enter stage three of restrictions. Under this stage, public gatherings will increase to five people from two households and there will be a staged return to schools for some years and specialist schools. If the daily average number of cases fall below five by 26 October, then the curfew would be ended. Why is Melbourne seeing more cases during lockdown? Australia 'anti-lockdown' arrest stirs controversy Outside of the greater Melbourne area, the rest of Victoria state will have restrictions eased slightly quicker. From 13 September, up to five people from two households will be able to gather outdoors. Outdoor pools and playgrounds will open and religious services can be conducted outdoors with a maximum of five people. The announcement comes a day after anti-lockdown protests were attended by hundreds of people across Australia. This video can not be played There were scuffles between protesters and police on Saturday In Melbourne, about 300 peoplemarched through the city in defiance of the measures. ""It is selfish to protest and it is unlawful. Any behaviour from anyone that contributes to more virus than less and more restrictions than less is not in anyone's interests,"" Mr Andrews said. ""People want this over and so do I,"" he added.

"Several boats sink at pro-Trump parade in TexasReports say people had to be rescued from the water, but no-one has been injured.","The choppy water was likely caused by the large number of vessels moving closely together Several boats have sunk on a lake in the US state of Texas during a parade to support President Donald Trump in November's election, officials say. Authorities say the choppy water was likely caused by the large number of vessels moving closely together on Lake Travis, near the state capital, Austin. Images showed boats with Trump campaign flags manoeuvring at close quarters. Media say people had to be rescued from the water, but there were no immediate reports of injuries. The event, called Lake Travis Trump Boat Parade, was organised on Facebook, and more than 2,600 people marked themselves as having attended it. More than 2,600 people marked themselves as having attended the event The event was organised by supporters of President Trump on Lake Travis An investigation has been launched and there is no evidence of any intentional act, Travis County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kristen Dark said. ""We responded to multiple calls of boats in distress, several of them sank,"" she said. ""We had an exceptional number of boats on the lake today... When they all started moving at the same time, it generated significant waves."" The incident happened around 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday, Labor Day weekend in the US. The event page said boats were asked to drive at 10mph (16km/h).

"Policeman killed in 'terrorist' attack in TunisiaThe incident happened in Sousse, where 38 people, mostly Britons, were killed in a 2015 attack.Africa","Security forces chased the attackers through the tourist areas of El Kantaoui Security officials in Tunisia say a police officer has been killed and another wounded in a knife attack in the coastal resort of Sousse. Three assailants were shot dead after the incident, which is being described as a terrorist attack. In 2015Sousse was the scene of one of Tunisia's worst attacks, when 38 people, most of them British tourists, were killed by a gunman. The latest incident comes two days after a new government was sworn in. The suspected militants rammed their vehicle into a National Guard checkpoint at a junction near the city's port. ""A patrol of two National Guard officers was attacked with a knife in the centre of Sousse,"" National Guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli said, according to the AFP news agency. ""One died as a martyr and the other was wounded and is hospitalised,"" he said. ""This was a terrorist attack"". The knifemen stole guns and a police vehicle during the attack before making off, Mr Jebabli said. Security forces took off after them through the tourist areas of El Kantaoui. ""In a firefight three terrorists were killed,"" he said, adding that two guns and the car were recovered. It is unclear if the assailants were tied to any particular extremist group, but the wider threat in Tunisia in recent years has been from dispersed sleeper cells composed of jihadists that returned from Syria, Libya, and Iraq, says the BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital Tunis. Thirty-eight people lost their lives when a gunman opened fire on tourists staying in El Kantaoui in June 2015. Thirty of those killed were British tourists staying at the Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba. The Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack by Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui. The situation in Tunisia has improved greatly since then, although a state of emergency is in place. Since 2015, successive governments have changed their counter-terrorism strategy by focusing more on prevention, rather than response, our reporter says. Countries like Germany and the UK have contributed to training security forces. This week Tunisia's parliament approved a new government formed by Prime Minister-designate Hichem Mechichi. Mr Mechichi appointed technocrats to his government rather than members of political parties as had been the case in the past.

"Test MPs for Covid-19 every day, says SpeakerRuling out masks, Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls for daily tests so packed Parliamentary scenes can return.UK Politics","Crowded scenes like the ones during Brexit voting could return with regular testing, the Speaker suggested MPs could be tested daily for coronavirus to allow them to safely fill the chamber of the House of Commons, the Speaker has suggested. Sir Lindsay Hoyle told Times Radio he had spoken to the NHS and government about getting ""a quick turnaround of tests"" to allow more MPs in. But the Speaker said he would not ""compromise health and safety"". MPs wearing masks had been ruled out as it could make it harder for them to be recognised and make speeches, he said. The pandemic has prompted some of the biggest changes to parliamentary procedure in centuries, with limited numbers allowed in both chambers so MPs can keep two metres apart. But some MPs have criticised the subdued atmosphere with so many of them working remotely. And after Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg scrapped remote voting, there were lengthy queues to cast votes on motions and amendments because it is not considered safe for MPs to crowd into the traditional voting lobbies all at once. Masks for MPs ""really wouldn't work"", said Sir Lindsay Hoyle as he backed daily testing Asked about the prospect of regularly testing MPs so more of them could safely enter the Commons chamber, Mr Hoyle said: ""To be quite honest with you, I'd like to do it daily, not weekly. The problem is weekly testing doesn't tell you anything."" He said he had ""made approaches"" to the NHS and government to ask, ""Why can't we have a testing system?"" Hancock social distancing slip-up caught on camera Discrimination row over MPs queuing up to vote They would need ""a quick turnaround of tests"" and Commons authorities were ""looking at it"". Sir Lindsay said he agreed with Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg that masks for MPs ""really wouldn't work"" as it would be harder to recognise who was speaking and harder to be heard. Social distancing has meant the Commons chamber has been a much quieter place Asked about reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to see Parliament ""back to normal"" by Christmas, the Speaker said he wanted to make it happen but said he would not risk health and safety. ""We are a Covid-secure workplace - if we were to lose that status, the game is over,"" he said. ""It's about working in an efficient way. If people don't need to be here, why would we have them here?"" The Speaker also said the advice was ""very clear"" that he should not reopen the bars in Parliament yet, adding that the Strangers' Bar ""doesn't lend itself to social distancing"".

Explore airport testing to cut quarantine - Labour,"Airport coronavirus testing options should be explored as a way of cutting the number of travellers who must spend two weeks in quarantine, says Labour. A review of ""chaotic"" quarantine rules should consider a ""robust testing regime"", given the ""dire warnings"" from the travel industry, the party says. PM Boris Johnson has said airport tests would identify only 7% of cases and so could give a ""false sense of security"". And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said testing was not a ""silver bullet"". ""That's why we have the quarantine,"" Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""The idea that one test in an airport could resolve the quarantine issues... we couldn't safely do that,"" he said. Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? What are the quarantine rules for my holiday? A government spokesman said assessment of how testing might help was ongoing. ""Any potential change to the testing for arrivals would need to be robust in minimising the chance that positive cases are missed,"" he said. The BBC has been told a cabinet decision on whether to introduce airport testing has been repeatedly postponed and now may never happen. In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, Labour argues the UK's quarantine arrangements are ""losing public confidence and undermining our ability to keep people safe and save jobs"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he was calling for a ""two test system"". ""It isn't just about a test in an airport,"" he said, adding that follow-up tests would improve the accuracy of the results. ""If the government had it [a two test system] up and running it would take away need for 14 day quarantine policy,"" he said. This video can not be played The PM says the quarantine system is ""an important part of our repertoire"" People entering the UK face 14 days of self-isolation unless they are travelling from countries that are exempt - a status determined by the separate authorities in each of the four nations. In recent weeks, Britons holidaying in France, Spain and the Netherlands have been caught out by the removal of exemptions at short notice. Last week, Scotland and Wales told arrivals from Portugal and parts of Greece to quarantine, while England and Northern Ireland held off. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted it had created a ""confusing"" situation for travellers. In theory, airport testing is a great idea and would reduce the length of time quarantine could take. But there are a number of problems. The incubation period for coronavirus - the point at which someone becomes infected to the point at which they show symptoms - can be up to 14 days. In the early part of the incubation period the test may not pick up the virus. So you cannot just test at the airport and think someone is clear. They would still have to quarantine and then the idea discussed is that they would be tested after maybe seven or 10 days. That has a minimal effect on quarantine and would put the testing regime under even more strain. A more immediate solution - and one that has been put to the government - is to be a little more intelligent with the quarantine rules. It is a rather blunt tool - some countries are on the quarantine list with infection rates only a little higher than the UK. And national infection rates miss the differences between regions. One suggestion is you only insist on quarantine when a traveller has been in a high infection rate area. But of course that becomes even harder to enforce. In his letter to the home secretary, Mr Thomas-Symonds calls for a review to report back within a fortnight. ""It should include outlining options for a robust testing regime in airports, and related follow-up tests, that could help to safely minimise the need for 14-day quarantine,"" he writes. ""Given the huge challenges being faced by the travel sector and the scale of job losses, it makes sense to look at this area as part of a wider package of improvements to the testing regime."" He also said there were ""serious concerns"" about the poor monitoring of incoming travellers, claiming ""less than a third of passenger-locator forms are checked"". TRAVEL RIGHTS:Can I get a holiday refund? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Airlines have criticised the use of quarantine measures at a time when lockdowns around the world have contributed to a collapse in passenger demand. On Friday, Virgin Atlantic announced plans to axe another 1,150 jobs after completing a Â£1.2bn rescue deal, months after making 3,150 redundancies as a result of the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. Airport bosses have also criticised ministers. On-site testing facilities had already been set up at London's Heathrow Airport, chief executive John Holland-Kaye said last week. ""It is frustrating that the government just has not made a decision to get on with this, when governments in other countries in Europe are getting on and making it happen,"" he added. France and Germany are using testing at airports for passengers arriving from countries with a higher infection rate. And, on Friday, former Brexit Secretary David Davis said testing at UK airports - with passengers given results within two hours - could cut quarantine to ""less than five days"". ""If anybody is positive, they should be quarantined right there,"" he said, arguing the government could pay to house them in under-used airport hotels. However, the prime minister responded by pointing to Public Health England modelling suggesting only 7% of cases would be picked up. While he understood ""the difficulties"" the airline industry was facing, Mr Johnson said ""93% of the time you could have a real false sense of security, a false sense of confidence when you arrive and take a test"". ""The quarantine system that we have has got to be an important part of our repertoire, of our toolbox, in fighting Covid,"" he added. THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from?

Mass evacuation as Japan braces for typhoon,"Waves crash on the coast as Typhoon Haishen approaches the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima Typhoon Haishen has touched down in South Korea after slamming through southern Japan. The storm made landfall in Ulsan, just north of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city. More than 300 flights from 10 airports were cancelled, with some train services suspended. The typhoon caused a loss of power across hundreds of thousands of homes in Japan, though initial assessments suggest it did less damage than feared. Thirty-two people were injured, including four who sustained cuts after the glass windows of an evacuation centre were blown in, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Some eight million people in Japan had been asked to evacuate in the path of the storm. What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? The storm comes days after Maysak, one of the region's strongest typhoons in years, slammed into the Korean peninsula and Japan last week. High winds have already cut power to almost 5,000 households on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, including the resort island of Jeju, says a Reuters report. Hundreds of flights and train services were cancelled in Japan A typhoon alert has been issued for Jeju and other southern parts of South Korea like Gyeongsang province. But a KMA official told Yonhap News that it was likely the typhoon would weaken as it passed by. South Korea's Korea Forest Service had earlier raised the landslide alert to its highest level. Nearly 430,000 homes in the Kyushu region were without power,externalas of 03:00 local time Monday (18:00 GMT Sunday), Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Haishen has led to the closure of factories, schools and businesses across western Japan. Hundreds of flights and train services were also cancelled. This video can not be played The Filipino seaman was found drifting in a life jacket The typhoon has also forced Japan's coast guard to suspend its search for missing sailors from a cargo ship that sank during Typhoon Maysak.

The event, called Lake Travis Trump Boat Parade, was organised on Facebook, and more than 2,600 people marked themselves as having attended it. More than 2,600 people marked themselves as having attended the event The event was organised by supporters of President Trump on Lake Travis An investigation has been launched and there is no evidence of any intentional act, Travis County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kristen Dark said. ""We responded to multiple calls of boats in distress, several of them sank,"" she said. ""We had an exceptional number of boats on the lake today... When they all started moving at the same time, it generated significant waves."" The incident happened around 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday, Labor Day weekend in the US. The event page said boats were asked to drive at 10mph (16km/h). Paul Yura, from the National Weather Service in Austin/San Antonio, told the Associated Press that there were no storms in the area at the time of the parade.

Grand jury to investigate US 'spit hood' deathThe jury will decide whether to bring charges against officers who used a hood to restrain Daniel Prude.US & Canada,"Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police New York's attorney general has said a grand jury will be formed to investigate the death of Daniel Prude, an unarmed black man who suffocated after being restrained by police. Mr Prude - who suffered from mental health issues - died after officers put him in a ""spit hood"", designed to protect police from detainees' saliva. Protests have been held after footage of the incident in Rochester emerged. Seven police officershave been suspended. The 41-year-old died in March however his death has only just been reported. Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: ""The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish. My office will immediately move to empanel a grand jury as part of our exhaustive investigation into this matter."" They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Can viral videos stop police brutality? Don't shoot, I'm disabled The move has been welcomed by Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. But a spokeswoman for the Rochester Police Department declined to comment. Mr Prude's brother, Joe, told the New York Times: ""I am ecstatic about this,external. But right now I'm still waiting on seeing the indictment and them being prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" Joe said he called police on 23 March as Daniel was showing acute mental health problems. When officers arrived, he had been running naked through the streets. In body camera footage obtained from the police by Mr Prude's family, he can be seen lying on the ground as officers restrain him. While sitting on the road, he becomes agitated, alternately asking for money or a gun. This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality He began spitting on the street, but does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage. An officer says that Mr Prude told them he had Covid-19, and they place the spit hood on him. One officer can be seen pressing down on Mr Prude's head with both hands, saying ""stop spitting"". Mr Prude stops moving and goes quiet, and officers note he feels cold. Paramedics are called and Mr Prude is taken to hospital. His family took him off life support a week later. The medical examiner ruled his death as a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", with intoxication by the drug PCP, a contributing factor. Protests in Rochester have taken place nightly following the release of the footage Mayor Warren said the city police chief had failed to inform her of the case until the beginning of last month. But police chief La'Ron Singletary denied that his department had been trying to keep the details out of public view, and Michael Mazzaeo, president of the Rochester Police Locust Club, saidthe officers had followed their training ""step by step"". The officers were only disciplined after the footage was released, five months after Mr Prude's death. Protests in the city have taken place nightly since the release of the footage.

A security expert has described criticism of the police's handling of the stabbings as ""unfair"". Speaking to BBC Radio WM, Philip Ingram said it was ""important that we question our public officials"" but that it was an ""operational police matter"" and officers would be doing ""everything they can to keep the public safe"". ""They have to make sure they're carrying out their investigation in a way that allows them to gather their evidence that whenever they arrest someone they can get a successful prosecution. ""And therefore it's a balance between what you tell the public and how much you have got going around within the police so that they can do their job. ""Often if you release too much information that can then lead to the police lines being swamped... and put the public at greater risk."" Â© 2025 BBC.

'Major incident' after multiple stabbings in Birmingham,"This video can not be played Savvas Sfrantzis: ""After he stabbed her...he walked as if nothing happened"" A knifeman who killed one man and wounded seven other people in a two-hour stabbing rampage across Birmingham city centre is being hunted by police. The first stabbing was in Constitution Hill at 00:30 BST then the killer moved south, apparently attacking at random, officers said. The stabbings did not appear terrorism related, gang related or connected to disorder, West Midlands Police said. Murder inquiry detectives said they were hunting a single suspect. Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"" The force urged anyone with CCTV or mobile footage to contact them. One man died, another man and a woman suffered critical injuries and five other people were left with non-life-threatening injuries. Ch Supt Steve Graham said the attacker went on to stab people in Livery Street, Irving Street and finally in Hurst Street, where the city's Gay Village meets the Chinese Quarter, at about 02:20 BST. Police said there was no evidence the stabbings were a hate crime. This video can not be played Nikita Denton told the BBC the victim she helped was alone and in a state of shock A woman who was out celebrating her 29th birthday described how she helped another woman who was ""on the street bleeding heavily"". Nikita Denton, of Edgbaston, said: ""My best friend Jay held her head and talked her through everything the whole time and wouldn't leave her side. ""She looked very dazed and confused, she couldn't talk. But she was talking to my friend with blinks."" When paramedics arrived they asked them for help. ""I got water and used the torch on my phone to help them see the wounds as they didn't have a torch at that time,"" she said. ""There were about four wounds."" She added: ""I'd hate to think if we weren't there that night as she would have been alone."" Police said it was ""not appropriate"" to speculate on the motivation Ch Supt Graham said officers - some armed - remained across the city centre to reassure people. He added they had received a number of descriptions of the suspect but would not be releasing any details for the time being. Follow live updates from the scene He said: ""The events during the early hours of this morning are tragic, shocking and understandably frightening. ""It does appear to be a random attack because we haven't found any links between the victims, either in their nature or in where they were socialising. ""Please be assured that we are doing absolutely everything we can to find whoever was responsible and try to understand what exactly happened."" Ch Supt Steve Graham said it was too early say whether a knife found in a city centre drain was connected to the murder inquiry Savvas Sfrantzis, who was working nearby, said he saw a man stab a girl multiple times but people thought at first he was trying to take her necklace. ""He was like very cold and he wasn't panicking and he wasn't reacting or anything. After he stabbed her between five and seven times... he walked off as if nothing has happened,"" he said. Officers earlier found a knife in a drain but Mr Graham said it was ""way too early"" to say if it was connected to the case. ""What I think it does suggest is the comprehensive nature of our inquiry - that already we've got people going down drains - we've got that level of detailed searches taking place,"" he said. David Nash, who was running the Village Inn in Hurst Street, said after a ""normal night"" he heard someone shout ""stop him - he's just stabbed somebody"" between 02:00 and 02:15. ""The bars were starting to wind down and the next thing we know the area is engulfed with armed response vehicles, normal police vehicles, police on foot, ambulances,"" he said. ""They just came from absolutely nowhere and the area was full of them and then the police helicopter was up."" He said he then saw paramedics treating two people who seemed to have been stabbed. This video can not be played Video posted on social media shows a number of emergency service vehicles, and parts of the city centre have been cordoned off Nathan Hudson, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said 14 ambulances attended and he was among 11 paramedic officers who were also sent to help. A team of St John Ambulance volunteers based at the Arcadian nightspot also treated casualties. The ""smirking"" attacker was seen walking past the Sidewalk nightclub shortly after stabbing at least two people further up the street Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"". He tweeted: ""All my thoughts are with those affected by the terrible incident in Birmingham last night."" Witness Cara Curran, a club promoter working in the Arcadian Centre, said it had been busier during the evening than it had been at any time since the start of lockdown. She said she had finished her shift at about 00:30 BST and was drinking with colleagues when she heard a ""loud bang and quite a lot of commotion"". Police set up a cordon at the junction of Hurst Street and Bromsgrove Street after the final stabbing The streets in the area had already been closed to traffic due to coronavirus restrictions. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) David Jamieson said police would be working with the council to see if there were ""any further measures that need to be taken in the city centre"", following the stabbings.

Quarantine holiday rules in detail,"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight.

Large protests expected in Belarus amid crackdown,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Hundreds of people have been arrested in Belarus following a fourth consecutive weekend of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. At least 633 people were detained during the unrest, the interior ministry said on Monday. Thousands more defied heavy security and rallied in the capital Minsk, where troops and water cannon were deployed. The demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after his re-election last month amid allegations of ballot-rigging. Mass unrest since then has seen at least four people killed and hundreds injured as the government tries to stamp out dissent. A number of opposition figures have fled the country. On Saturday, activist Olga Kovalkova became the latest to say she had taken refuge in neighbouring Poland amid threats of imprisonment. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus cracks down on journalists covering unrest 'We can breathe for the first time in our lives' Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has accused Western nations of interfering. Protesters, human rights activists and observers say riot police are brutally suppressing peaceful marches in the former Soviet republic. Belarus borders Russia, on which it depends heavily for energy and with which it historically has close ties, as well as Ukraine and EU states. The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the republic. It said some 363 people had been sent to detention centres pending court hearings. Eyewitnesses told Russia's Interfax news agency that police began to make arrests in Minsk after the unsanctioned rally ended and people were going home. Video footage on Sunday shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. Protesters were chased with batons in Minsk Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces. ""They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Belta news agency. Sunday has become the key day for street demonstrations since the rallies began. In recent days, the security forces - dressed all in black with balaclavas over their faces - targeted university students as they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans. Protesters streamed through Minsk One protester in Minsk, who gave her name as Lyudmila, told the BBC earlier that the demonstrators were undeterred by the security forces. ""We are definitely not ready to get back to the life we had for many years now,"" she said. ""We finally feel like we matter because we've been living in apathy for way too long and now we just have this feeling of solidarity and we actually think that - well, I feel personally that - changes already are happening so that's definitely not the time to give up."" Protests have also been reported in other Belarusian cities and towns including Grodno, Mogilev and Gomel. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk Sunday's rally had several phases. The first was the tense and uncertain. Security forces had used razor wire to close off the obvious gathering points, Minsk's main monuments and squares, and were standing guard behind them. Would-be protesters stood awkwardly on street corners wondering where and when the march would start. Those in small groups were vulnerable and we watched as a man holding the outlawed red and white flag of the opposition was dragged into a car by security officers and driven away. Then, as the numbers grew, there were nervy stand-offs near Independence Square. As they grew in confidence the demonstrators approached, berating the riot police at the barricades that now blocked the road. At about 16:00 the crowd swelled exponentially as people marched out of the centre. This was no longer the brave early arrivals, it was Belarusians young and old. Some were in fancy dress, others wearing clothes that directly mocked the riot police, the Omon. There were families, children, dogs - someone even brought a goose. For the fourth Sunday in a row President Lukashenko's attempts to stop the protest against him failed. The activist said she had left for Poland as she would have faced a long jail term had she not agreed to leave Belarus. Ms Kovalkova said security forces had driven her to a border post where she was able to board a bus to Poland after the driver recognised her. A spokesman for Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country would offer support to victims of repression in Belarus. Opposition activist Olga Kovalkova (seen here on 22 August) has now left Belarus On Friday,opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has sought refuge in Lithuania, urged the UN to help halt the authorities' crackdown on protesters. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, represented the chief opposition to Mr Lukashenko in the election, entering the presidential race after her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, and another candidate were jailed. She said the opposition was demanding an end to the police violence, the immediate release of all political prisoners, and a free and fair election. Last month,EU leaders agreed to impose sanctions,external- including asset freezes - on as yet unnamed Belarusian officials involved in alleged election-rigging, brutality and imprisonment of protesters. The exact sanctions are still being worked out. The UN special rapporteur on Belarus, Anais Marin, said Mr Lukashenko's re-election as president was ""completely manipulated"" and ""people's votes were stolen"". This video can not be played A 73-year-old great-grandmother has turned into an unlikely hero for demonstrators in Belarus She accused the Belarus police of torture, citing as one example a 16-year-old who was ""so badly beaten up he was left in a coma"". ""The authorities must release all those arbitrarily arrested,"" she said. ""The government is waging an insane war against its own people."" Mr Lukashenko has denied any allegations of vote-rigging. He has blamed some EU nations, in particular Poland and Lithuania, of trying to force regime change. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. This video can not be played Lukashenko leaves helicopter wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle On Thursday, he indicated he was open to moving closer to Russia, saying the protests had ""prompted us to make relevant conclusions"". On at least two occasions he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.

Son of WW2 gunner welcomes recovery of bomber,"Sgt Leonard Shrubsall was part of the seven man crew of a Short Stirling Bomber The son of a crew member of a World War Two bomber that crashed into a lake in the Netherlands has welcomed the Dutch government operation to lift it. The Short Stirling Bomber, based at RAF Downham Market in Norfolk, was lost returning from a 1943 raid on Germany. Gunner Sgt Leonard Shrubsall's son Richard, 76, thought his father's plane had been lost over the sea. But the plane had been found in a lake and the operation to recover it started on Monday. It is expected to take four to five weeks. Sgt Shrubsall's wife Beatrice kept a tin which contained the telegram and letter from King George VI about her husband Sgt Shrubsall's wife Beatrice was three months pregnant with Richard when she received a telegram saying her 30-year-old husband had failed to return from the operation over Berlin. Mr Shrubsall, from Iwade in Kent, welcomed the decision of the Dutch authorities to fund the raising of the plane, which landed in Lake Markermeer near Amsterdam, after it was shot down by a German night fighter. ""I am so pleased they found the plane and are going to raise it up. I think they realise what we did for the Dutch during the war and are looking to say 'thank you'."" he said. Mr Shrubsall's wife Janice, 76, said: ""We couldn't believe it when we got the letter."" Janice and Richard Shrubsall had thought the bomber may have crashed into the sea Mr Shrubsall said: ""I never thought we'd find him. We thought he'd come down over the North Sea, but he came down near Amsterdam."" He said he and his family were planning to go to the Netherlands in October to find out the results of the recovery operation. Sgt Leonard Shrubsall was a bomber gunner He said he was not worried about concerns from some plane enthusiasts that the planned recovery wasusing a grabber rather than a dambecause he believed the authorities in the Netherlands ""know what they are doing"". Mrs Shrubsall said after Mr Shrubsall's mother died, they found ""she kept a tin, a small oval tin, with photographs (of Sgt Shrubsall) and letters he had written, and the telegram reporting him missing"". The crew of the bomber were photographed earlier in the war in front of another aircraft The crew of Short Stirling BK716 were: Sgt Charles Armstrong Bell, 29, from Bearpark, County Durham Pilot Officer John Michael Campbell, 30, from Golders Green, north London Flying Officer Harry Gregory Farrington, 24, from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada Flying Officer John Frederick Harris, 29, from Swindon, Wiltshire Sgt Ronald Kennedy, 22, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne Sgt John Francis James McCaw, 20, from Belleville, Ontario, Canada Sgt Leonard Richard James Shrubsall, 30, from Iwade, Kent Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

'Major incident' after multiple stabbings in BirminghamPolice report there are 'a number of injured people' after being called to an incident in the city centre.Birmingham & Black Country,"This video can not be played Savvas Sfrantzis: ""After he stabbed her...he walked as if nothing happened"" A knifeman who killed one man and wounded seven other people in a two-hour stabbing rampage across Birmingham city centre is being hunted by police. The first stabbing was in Constitution Hill at 00:30 BST then the killer moved south, apparently attacking at random, officers said. The stabbings did not appear terrorism related, gang related or connected to disorder, West Midlands Police said. Murder inquiry detectives said they were hunting a single suspect. Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"" The force urged anyone with CCTV or mobile footage to contact them. One man died, another man and a woman suffered critical injuries and five other people were left with non-life-threatening injuries. Ch Supt Steve Graham said the attacker went on to stab people in Livery Street, Irving Street and finally in Hurst Street, where the city's Gay Village meets the Chinese Quarter, at about 02:20 BST. Police said there was no evidence the stabbings were a hate crime. This video can not be played Nikita Denton told the BBC the victim she helped was alone and in a state of shock A woman who was out celebrating her 29th birthday described how she helped another woman who was ""on the street bleeding heavily"". Nikita Denton, of Edgbaston, said: ""My best friend Jay held her head and talked her through everything the whole time and wouldn't leave her side. ""She looked very dazed and confused, she couldn't talk. But she was talking to my friend with blinks."" When paramedics arrived they asked them for help. ""I got water and used the torch on my phone to help them see the wounds as they didn't have a torch at that time,"" she said. ""There were about four wounds."" She added: ""I'd hate to think if we weren't there that night as she would have been alone."" Police said it was ""not appropriate"" to speculate on the motivation Ch Supt Graham said officers - some armed - remained across the city centre to reassure people. He added they had received a number of descriptions of the suspect but would not be releasing any details for the time being. Follow live updates from the scene He said: ""The events during the early hours of this morning are tragic, shocking and understandably frightening. ""It does appear to be a random attack because we haven't found any links between the victims, either in their nature or in where they were socialising. ""Please be assured that we are doing absolutely everything we can to find whoever was responsible and try to understand what exactly happened."" Ch Supt Steve Graham said it was too early say whether a knife found in a city centre drain was connected to the murder inquiry Savvas Sfrantzis, who was working nearby, said he saw a man stab a girl multiple times but people thought at first he was trying to take her necklace. ""He was like very cold and he wasn't panicking and he wasn't reacting or anything. After he stabbed her between five and seven times... he walked off as if nothing has happened,"" he said. Officers earlier found a knife in a drain but Mr Graham said it was ""way too early"" to say if it was connected to the case. ""What I think it does suggest is the comprehensive nature of our inquiry - that already we've got people going down drains - we've got that level of detailed searches taking place,"" he said. David Nash, who was running the Village Inn in Hurst Street, said after a ""normal night"" he heard someone shout ""stop him - he's just stabbed somebody"" between 02:00 and 02:15. ""The bars were starting to wind down and the next thing we know the area is engulfed with armed response vehicles, normal police vehicles, police on foot, ambulances,"" he said. ""They just came from absolutely nowhere and the area was full of them and then the police helicopter was up."" He said he then saw paramedics treating two people who seemed to have been stabbed. This video can not be played Video posted on social media shows a number of emergency service vehicles, and parts of the city centre have been cordoned off Nathan Hudson, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said 14 ambulances attended and he was among 11 paramedic officers who were also sent to help. A team of St John Ambulance volunteers based at the Arcadian nightspot also treated casualties. The ""smirking"" attacker was seen walking past the Sidewalk nightclub shortly after stabbing at least two people further up the street Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked emergency services ""working hard at the scene"". He tweeted: ""All my thoughts are with those affected by the terrible incident in Birmingham last night."" Witness Cara Curran, a club promoter working in the Arcadian Centre, said it had been busier during the evening than it had been at any time since the start of lockdown. She said she had finished her shift at about 00:30 BST and was drinking with colleagues when she heard a ""loud bang and quite a lot of commotion"". Police set up a cordon at the junction of Hurst Street and Bromsgrove Street after the final stabbing The streets in the area had already been closed to traffic due to coronavirus restrictions. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) David Jamieson said police would be working with the council to see if there were ""any further measures that need to be taken in the city centre"", following the stabbings. A rise in violence was ""almost inevitable"" due to the pandemic, when people were suffering ""pent-up feelings"" and some were unsure of their futures, the Labour PCC said. Outside the cordoned-off area, much of the city centre, such as Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre and the Sealife Centre in Brindleyplace, is open as usual. Were you in the area?

Music changes chord for first time in seven years,"This video can not be played Music fans gather in a church to hear a chord change in a composition meant to last 639 years Fans have flocked to a church in Germany to hear a chord change in a musical composition that lasts for 639 years. It is the first change in the piece, As Slow As Possible, in seven years. The work is by the avant-garde American composer, John Cage. It began 19 years ago with a pause lasting nearly 18 months. The change of chord took place on the specially built organ on which the composition is being performed. The Saint Burchardi Church in the city of Halberstadt started playing the music in 2001 and the last note change took place in 2013. The music As Slow As Possible will end in 2640 Fans queue for the chord change The score is made up of eight pages of music, to be played at the piano or organ - very slowly. But the wait for the next scheduled chord change will be quick in comparison - with 5 February 2022 slated as the date. The piece will end in 2640. Cage, who died in 1992 at the age of 79, wrote the piece in the 1980s. The composer is arguably most famous for 4'33"".

Tougher Covid measures introduced in Bolton,"Bolton residents are asked not to mix or use public transport unless absolutely necessary Tougher measures are being introduced in Bolton in an effort to stop coronavirus cases rising and prevent a full local lockdown. The infection rate in the area has risen to 99 cases per 100,000 people per week - the highest in England. Those aged between 18 and 49 account for more than 90% of cases. Announcing new and immediate measures affecting transport and social mixing, council bosses pleaded for ""everyone in Bolton to play their part"". Residents have been asked to only use public transport for essential purposes, which means travel to education, work, and essential matters such as hospital appointments. People have also been told not to mix with other households in any setting indoors or outdoors anywhere, except in their support bubble. In a joint statement, council leader David Greenhalgh and chief executive Tony Oakham said: ""It has been a tough period for individuals, families and businesses but we don't want to throw away all our hard work by allowing the infection rate to rise even higher. ""Now, more than ever, we need everyone in Bolton to play their part. ""Nobody wants these restrictions to remain a moment longer than necessary and we believe these new measures will keep everyone safe and help avoid a full lockdown in Bolton."" Dr Helen Lowey, director of Public Health for Bolton Council, said: ""We are carrying out extra testing including giving out home testing kits, and are carrying out extra site visits to support businesses to be Covid secure, and carrying out enforcement where necessary. ""Evidence from Oldham and Blackburn shows stopping households mixing works."" Bolton's move comes as other parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshiremove out of stricter lockdown measures.

'Critical moment' as students return to universityFigures show the number of newly detected coronavirus infections is highest among young adults.UK,"Thousands of students are preparing to return to university after the coronavirus lockdown A leading epidemiologist has warned the country is at a ""critical moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, as students prepare to return to universities. Dame Anne Johnson, of University College London, told the BBC data showed the highest number of detected infections was in young people. It comes after government scientific advisors said ""significant outbreaks"" linked to universities were likely. Universities have said steps are being taken to minimise risks on campuses. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Anne, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCL, said: ""We are now seeing the highest number of infections or at least detected infections in younger people aged 20 to 29 and also going up to 45-year-olds."" She added that the data was ""not surprising"", as young people, she said, were more likely to have socialised with friends and family after lockdown restrictions were eased. University return 'could spark Covid avalanche' House party concerns amid rise in Covid cases Tougher Covid measures introduced in Bolton The latestfigures from Public Health England,external(PHE) showed the highest coronavirus case rates were among 15 to 44-year-olds. In the regions with the highest overall rates, and with most local authorities on its local lockdown watchlist, young working adults aged between 20 and 29-years-old were most affected. On Saturday, the UK recorded 1,813 new infections, while 12 more people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, said in a documentpublished on Friday,externalthere was a ""significant risk"" that higher education ""could amplify local and national transmission"". ""It is highly likely that there will be significant outbreaks associated with higher education, and asymptomatic transmission may make these harder to detect,"" the report added. It comes asBolton is placed under tougher coronavirus measuresto stop the rising infection rate, now the highest in England at 99 cases per 100,000 people per week. People aged 18 to 49 account for 90% of cases. And in Leeds officials are urging young peopleto take responsibility for controlling the spread of coronavirusfollowing an increase in house parties in the city. The city has been added to the lockdown watchlist - along with Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Corby and Kettering - meaning people there could face tougher restrictions if the number of infections continues to increase. Council leader Judith Blake said there had been an increase in music events, house parties and illegal raves, adding fines of Â£10,000 were being issued, and urged caution at a time when university students were set to return. ""We feel there is a bit of a complacency coming in. What we are seeing is the numbers are changing, and actually more young people are testing positive and they are spread around the city,"" she said. Police and the council in Leeds issued seven fines to organisers of illegal raves last weekend Dame Anne told the Today programme it was ""going to be incredibly important to communicate to young people the risks of transmitting coronavirus"", with particular emphasis on maintaining social distancing. She said it should be highlighted ""that we need to avoid those situations where we have a lot of close contact, keep distanced"". ""When we can't do that wear face coverings, wash hands, and isolate when we're sick,"" she said. Dame Anne also stressed the importance of infection control among vulnerable communities, particularly in care homes and hospitals. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Concerns have also been raised that students could spread the virus when they travel from their family homes to university campuses. Dr Mike Tildesley, an associate professor at the University of Warwick and expert in infection modelling, told BBC Breakfast that the UK was mostly dealing with ""really local"" outbreaks, but the movement of students across the country could cause a wave of infection, especially as they return to families for Christmas. Universities were trying to minimise the risk on campuses with strategies including online teaching, grouping students together within year groups, and putting in place local testing and tracing policies, he said. He said that small group teaching was still happening in person, but would take place inside large lecture theatres to allow for social distancing. The scientific advisory group Sage has advised universities to consider providing dedicated accommodation facilities to enable students who test positive to quarantine and minimise the risk of an outbreak. Universities have also been urged to work with local authorities in addition to conducting their own test and trace programmes. THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from?

Grand jury to investigate 'spit hood' death,"Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police New York's attorney general has said a grand jury will be formed to investigate the death of Daniel Prude, an unarmed black man who suffocated after being restrained by police. Mr Prude - who suffered from mental health issues - died after officers put him in a ""spit hood"", designed to protect police from detainees' saliva. Protests have been held after footage of the incident in Rochester emerged. Seven police officershave been suspended. The 41-year-old died in March however his death has only just been reported. Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: ""The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish. My office will immediately move to empanel a grand jury as part of our exhaustive investigation into this matter."" They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Can viral videos stop police brutality? Don't shoot, I'm disabled The move has been welcomed by Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. But a spokeswoman for the Rochester Police Department declined to comment. Mr Prude's brother, Joe, told the New York Times: ""I am ecstatic about this,external. But right now I'm still waiting on seeing the indictment and them being prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" Joe said he called police on 23 March as Daniel was showing acute mental health problems. When officers arrived, he had been running naked through the streets. In body camera footage obtained from the police by Mr Prude's family, he can be seen lying on the ground as officers restrain him. While sitting on the road, he becomes agitated, alternately asking for money or a gun. This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality He began spitting on the street, but does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage. An officer says that Mr Prude told them he had Covid-19, and they place the spit hood on him. One officer can be seen pressing down on Mr Prude's head with both hands, saying ""stop spitting"". Mr Prude stops moving and goes quiet, and officers note he feels cold. Paramedics are called and Mr Prude is taken to hospital. His family took him off life support a week later. The medical examiner ruled his death as a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", with intoxication by the drug PCP, a contributing factor. Protests in Rochester have taken place nightly following the release of the footage Mayor Warren said the city police chief had failed to inform her of the case until the beginning of last month. But police chief La'Ron Singletary denied that his department had been trying to keep the details out of public view, and Michael Mazzaeo, president of the Rochester Police Locust Club, saidthe officers had followed their training ""step by step"". The officers were only disciplined after the footage was released, five months after Mr Prude's death. Protests in the city have taken place nightly since the release of the footage. Mr Prude's death came two months before that of George Floyd, whose killing while in police custody sparked widespread outrage and incited national and international demonstrations against police brutality and racism.

Bar 'could close' over 'unacceptable' crowd scenesOfficials say steps are to be taken as a video appears to show clubbers ignoring Covid guidelines.Wales,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing A popular bar in Cardiff city centre could be closed after a video showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore social distancing guidelines. The footage was captured outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday. The nightclub said it adheres to coronavirus rules and turns away large crowds. But Cardiff council said it could close the venue unless there are improvements. ""Our officers will be visiting the premises today to discuss last night's scenes,"" said a Cardiff council official. ""The council intends to use the images obtained from last night with a view to taking action against the venue for breaching Covid-19 health and safety measures, as set out by Welsh Government."" The authority said it was the responsibility of businesses to ensure 2m social distancing was maintained inside and outside venues. ""The safety of visitors to the city centre remains a priority and processes to minimise the spread of the virus must be taken seriously,"" added the council. ""Scenes like this are unacceptable and if immediate improvements are not made then the council could close the premises."" City leaders said they would take action against any venues ""not following the rules"". Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. He said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing outside the bar. He asked police officers nearby why they were not taking action but Mr Cottrell said he was told it was a matter for the establishment to comply with coronavirus guidelines. Responding to that claim, South Wales Police said officers did engage with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue has also been visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". ""Our officers work to engage, encourage and explain the legislation imposed by Welsh Government, and enforce where necessary and proportionate,"" said a police spokesman. ""Policing our capital city is a huge undertaking, and videos such as the one posted on social media on Friday night do not capture the true demand placed on our officers, who work tirelessly to keep visitors to the busy area safe."" Coyote Ugly said it is ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. ""Late in the evening we've had some big groups arrive, mixed households, and we simply turn them away,"" said spokesman Sean McMahon. Public Health Wales have expressed concerns that some 20-30 year-olds are spreading the virus ""There are big placards both inside and out explaining the rules on social distancing. ""They turn up, we know where these groups are coming from but we tell them there's too many and they aren't coming in. There are no exceptions. ""It's a safe venue. We have social distancing throughout.  There's no dancing on the bars, like there used to be. You can see from our CCTV that it's working. ""It's a shame because someone coming past has just snapped this late in the evening."" Large groups of people visited Cardiff Bay as soon as travel restrictions ended last month Public Health Wales (PHW) has expressed concerns that a lack of social distancing among 20-30 year-olds has increased the spread of Covid-19 to other groups of people. Dr Chris Williams said younger people ""really need to think hard about how they are socially distancing"". He said the Coyote Ugly footage showed individuals were not keeping 2m apart. ""We would really urge people, if they're going out and taking advantage of the opening of the night-time economy, they should avoid being on the same tables and being with people from outside their grouped households,"" he told BBC Wales. ""They should do their best to socially distance while they're out."" ""We would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, and even fatal,"" a statement said. Thelatest figuresshow eight new cases in Cardiff in the last day. Health Minister Vaughan Gething previously saidstag and hen-dos should be a thing of the pastfollowing a rise in cases in Cardiff. He blamed the spike in the capital on ""indoor contact rather than outdoor contact"" and warned against pub crawls, and against ignoring health advice on socialising.

Anti-lockdown protest as Scotland Covid cases riseProtesters opposed to Covid restrictions gather in Edinburgh as figures show the highest weekly rise in cases since May.Scotland,"Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions gathered in Edinburgh Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions have gathered in Edinburgh as figures showed the highest weekly rise in cases since May. Coronavirus sceptics, vaccine conspiracy theorists and those opposed to mandatory mask-wearing staged a rally at Holyrood. It comes as figures showed almost a thousand people tested positive for the virus this week in Scotland. In the past seven days there were 994 confirmed cases. The figure is almost double the 507 new cases in the week previous. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch described the protesters as ""deeply irresponsible"". Hundreds of protesters joined the rally outside the Scottish Parliament He said: ""I honestly do not understand it. ""I think it is irresponsible - do they think we're making it up? 194 countries are making up a viral pandemic. ""I would love to have not lived through the last six months, both in my job and what we have had to do to our country and many others. ""I think it is deeply irresponsible."" Hundreds of protesters marched to the parliament building in Edinburgh with flags and placards for the Scotland Against Lockdown protest, organised by the Saving Scotland Facebook group. A post advertising the event said it was ""time to stand up together, and listen to real scientific evidence in regards to the health of the Scottish people."" The group said lockdown was causing ""more harm than the virus"" and that Scots should say ""no to mandatory vaccines and masks. No to secondary lockdowns."" Police Scotland said it had been aware of the demonstration and that officers had provided a ""proportionate response"" and no arrests had been made. In the past 24 hours, the number of cases in Scotland rose by 141. There were no new deaths. The figures showed the biggest rise was in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area where 68 new cases were confirmed. The last time weekly cases exceeded the current total was 17 May, although there have been changes to the Scottish government's reporting of figures since then, including incorporating the results of home testing kits from July. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 overall in Scotland now stands at 21,189 and the number of infected patients who have died remains at 2,496. According to the government's latest figures, NHS Lanarkshire saw another 20 cases - an increase on the 16 announced on Friday when itwarned the region was close to having to reintroduce restrictions, similar to those imposed onother parts of western Scotland. NHS Grampian, where the Aberdeen bar cluster was identified last month, has recorded an increase of just two new cases. A total of seven cases have been discovered in Ayrshire and Arran, 14 in the Forth Valley, six in the Highlands, eight in Tayside and 14 by NHS Lothian. A single new case was identified by both NHS Borders and NHS Dumfries and Galloway. The number of tests carried out fell to 15,618 - the lowest total since 24 August. The number of new confirmed cases represents 1.5% of newly tested individuals, say the figures. As of Friday night, two people were in intensive care with coronavirus and a further 251 infected people were in hospital, although that figure includes patients who may not be receiving treatment for the disease.

Son of WW2 gunner welcomes recovery of bomberGunner Sgt Leonard Shrubsall's son Richard thought his father's plane had been lost over the sea.,"Sgt Leonard Shrubsall was part of the seven man crew of a Short Stirling Bomber The son of a crew member of a World War Two bomber that crashed into a lake in the Netherlands has welcomed the Dutch government operation to lift it. The Short Stirling Bomber, based at RAF Downham Market in Norfolk, was lost returning from a 1943 raid on Germany. Gunner Sgt Leonard Shrubsall's son Richard, 76, thought his father's plane had been lost over the sea. But the plane had been found in a lake and the operation to recover it started on Monday. It is expected to take four to five weeks. Sgt Shrubsall's wife Beatrice kept a tin which contained the telegram and letter from King George VI about her husband Sgt Shrubsall's wife Beatrice was three months pregnant with Richard when she received a telegram saying her 30-year-old husband had failed to return from the operation over Berlin. Mr Shrubsall, from Iwade in Kent, welcomed the decision of the Dutch authorities to fund the raising of the plane, which landed in Lake Markermeer near Amsterdam, after it was shot down by a German night fighter. ""I am so pleased they found the plane and are going to raise it up. I think they realise what we did for the Dutch during the war and are looking to say 'thank you'."" he said. Mr Shrubsall's wife Janice, 76, said: ""We couldn't believe it when we got the letter."" Janice and Richard Shrubsall had thought the bomber may have crashed into the sea Mr Shrubsall said: ""I never thought we'd find him.
