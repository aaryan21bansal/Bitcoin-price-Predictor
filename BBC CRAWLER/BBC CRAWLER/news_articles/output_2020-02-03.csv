YouTube shines but Google ads continue to slowGoogle-owner Alphabet shares details of YouTube's ad business for the first time.Business,"Google's parent company has published details of its YouTube and cloud business for the first time, as the firm's advertising business continues to slow. YouTube's ad sales in the last three months of 2019 rose 31% year-on-year to $4.7bn (Â£3.62bn), Alphabet said. Overall Alphabet revenue increased by 17% year-on-year to $46bn - the slowest rate in more than two years. While YouTube is rapidly growing, Alphabet's cloud business lags rivals. For years the business did not publish revenue figures for its various divisions, to the concern of investors and regulators. When Sundar Pichai took over as Alphabet chief executive last year the policy changed, although it is still not releasing profit figures for individual units. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? Alphabet said it earned $2.6bn in cloud revenue for the most recent quarter - compared to almost $10bn at Amazon. However it is fast-growing, rising more than 50% year-on-year. Alphabet and others make money in cloud computing by charging companies to host their data remotely, rather than firms maintaining their own servers. Alphabet shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trade. Although growth missed analyst forecasts, Alphabet's business remains strong, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's always important to put these sorts of misses into perspective,"" he said. ""The core businesses, like Search and YouTube, continue to generate prodigious quantities of cash."" Google's advertising revenue increased 17% to almost $27.2bn. Alphabet reported quarterly profits of almost $10.7bn, up 19% year-on-year, while costs rose 18% to $36.8bn, as the firm invested in data centres and hired new staff. YouTube now counts about two million paid subscribers, Mr Pichai said. At more than $15bn for 2019, YouTube's ad business accounted for almost 10% of Alphabet's overall revenues last year - but the firm also said it shares a large portion of YouTube ad revenue with people posting videos. Mr Pichai said the firm sees opportunity to make even more money off its YouTube adverts, including by targeting them more precisely. ""We see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it,"" he said. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? What can you use instead of Google and Facebook?

PM: 'No need' for UK to follow EU rules on trade,"This video can not be played PM: We want a Canada-style deal with the EU Boris Johnson has set out his vision for a trade deal with the EU, saying there is ""no need"" for the UK to follow Brussels' rules. The PM called for a Canada-style free trade deal, saying the UK would return to the Withdrawal Agreement if such a deal was not reached. But the EU's Michel Barnier said its ""ambitious"" trade deal offer required a ""level playing field"". Labour said Mr Johnson's ""ideology had trumped common sense"". The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the PM risked trade and investment in the UK if he kept ""undermining collective agreements"". Under the EU-Canada deal, import tariffs on most goods have been eliminated between the two countries, though there are still customs and VAT checks. The flow of services, such as banking - which is much more important for the UK - between Canada and the EU are much more restricted. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Ports plan for Brexit Irish Sea checks Pound falls on fears of 'bare bones' EU trade deal Barnier: Work should start now on NI agreements Mr Johnson used his speech on ""unleashing Britain's potential"" to raise the prospect of the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms if EU chiefs refuse to sign off on a Canada-style free trade agreement. In his speech in Greenwich, London, the PM said: ""We have often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or an ambitious free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, on the example of Canada. ""We have made our choice - we want a free trade agreement, similar to Canada's but in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. ""The choice is emphatically not 'deal or no deal'. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's - or more like Australia's. In either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper mightily."" Mr Johnson rejected the requirement for the UK to adopt Brussels-made rules ""on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules"". Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab The PM added that he will seek ""a pragmatic agreement on security, protecting our citizens without trespassing on the autonomy of our respective legal systems"". He said the UK was ready to agree a deal on fishing with the EU and suggested that there would be annual negotiations on this. When asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether he accepted that leaving the EU with no comprehensive trade deal could have significant cost for jobs and businesses, Mr Johnson replied: ""We've got a deal, it's a great deal, we're out."" ""When I hear prophecies of doom I've heard them before, I don't believe in them,"" he added. What we saw today was Boris Johnson trying to set the tone for these crucial negotiations. He wants to go into them on the front foot, with a much more direct, assertive, even aggressive if you like, approach than that of Theresa May. And his message was a pretty blunt one; we are not accepting EU rules, we are not accepting the jurisdiction of the European courts, we are pursuing trade deals with other countries, and on fishing - crucial to many EU costal countries - British waters will be first and foremost for British boats. And, if at the end of all that we can't reach any sort of agreement, Britain will still prosper. It seems to me the speech was all about muscle flexing ahead of the negotiations. But be in no doubt, a trade deal with the EU is of huge importance to the British economy, and deals require compromise, whatever the rhetoric. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, offered a contrasting vision to Mr Johnson's. He said the EU was ready to offer a ""highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership"", which included zero tariffs and zero quotas. But, he said, this was dependent on the UK agreeing to ""specific and effective guarantees to ensure a level playing field"" so competition ""is and remains open and fair"". There would also need to be an agreement on fisheries to allow ""continued reciprocal access"", he said. Michel Barnier set out the EU's position in Brussels Mr Barnier said all goods coming into the EU will need to comply with its rules on health or other standards and, as a result, goods entering the union ""will be subject to regulatory checks"". ""Businesses must adapt now for this new reality,"" he said. The more standards the UK and EU had in common, the better the access the EU will be able to offer to its market. ""Will the UK continue to adhere to Europe's societal and regulatory model in the future or will it seek to diverge?"" he said. ""The UK's answer to this question will be fundamental."" The European Commission has published itsdraft negotiating mandate,externaland President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said negotiations would be ""hard and fair and fast"" but that the closer the UK wanted to be to the bloc, the more of its common rules it would have to abide by. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made a statement in the Commons reiterating the prime minister's speech, saying there would be no alignment with the EU or jurisdiction given to its courts. ""Now is the moment to look ahead with confidence and ambition,"" he said. ""Let us show the world that our finest achievement and greatest contributions are ahead."" But Labour's shadow Brexit minister, Paul Blomfield, said many of the issues of the past three years will resurface during the negotiations. ""We will continue to be dogged by the central dilemma that was at the heart of so much of the wrangling over the last three years,"" he told MPs. ""[Will the] new relationship be determined by the economic interests of our country or by the ideological commitments to break with the European social model that drove so many of the Brexit enthusiasts? ""I am sorry to say that today's statement suggestsâ¦ that ideology has trumped common sense."" The SNP's Stewart Hosie also condemned the stance taken by the government, saying its plans ""risk making the UK a smaller, insular and more isolated place"". Labour's Mr Corbyn added: ""Throughout the election campaignâ¦ the prime minister kept assuring us that there was no danger of this country becoming an undercutting islandâ¦ yet at the same time removes the legislative protection that makes sure we don't become an undercutting economic unit. ""The European Union will no doubt be very strong on maintaining alignment and regulations. He has got to come up with an answer."" In 2016, the EU signed a trade agreement with Canada - and this deal could be a template for the UK's future relationship with the EU. The Canada deal gets rid of tariffs (taxes) on the majority of goods traded between the countries - some ""sensitive"" food items, including eggs and chicken, are not covered by it. The EU/Canada agreement means public contracts are opened up to each other's contractors - so Canadian companies can, for example, pitch to build French railways. It also means Canadian products going to the EU have to comply with EU standards (for example on food and product safety) and vice versa. Services - a sector which makes up about 80% of the UK economy - are only partially covered by the deal. Importantly for the UK, this type of agreement does not cover financial services meaning UK-based banks would not be able to serve clients in the EU without licences from individual countries. At the moment, trade between the EU and Australia is based on a limited ""partnership framework"" agreed in 2008, covering co-operation in a wide range of economic areas and agreements on things such as mutual recognition of product standards. Negotiations between the EU and Australia on a fully-fledged free trade agreement began in 2018. Business groups called for more details of the UK's objectives, the Institute of Directors saying the government ""can't just stick to red lines"". And critics hit out at Mr Johnson's suggestion of a deal with the EU ""like Australia's"" with acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calling it ""no deal in all but name"". Sir Ed added: ""Deliberately hollowing out our trade is nothing short of a scorched earth policy for our economy."" In addition to a deal with the EU, the government also wants to make progress in striking free-trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Trade talks between Britain and the EU are due to begin in March and the bloc's own approach to the negotiations needs to be agreed by all 27 member states. While the UK officially left the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, it will remain wedded to EU rules during a transition period which ends in December this year - the PM has said it will not be extended.

Joaquin Phoenix praised for Baftas racism speech,"Joaquin Phoenix has received praise for using his Baftas speech to call out ""systemic racism"" in the film industry.

"'I was Â£32,000 in debt, it consumed every moment'","Darren received help for his money problems and is now debt-free After taking out one loan after another, then adding credit card debt, Darren had borrowed Â£32,000 he could not pay back. The 44-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, was juggling minimum payments and was struggling to cope. ""I was not reducing the debt, it was just going up month after month, year after year,"" he said. ""I had all the highs of spending the money, but when I was low, it was low. It consumes every thought, every moment of the day just worrying about debt. It was awful."" Credit card companies have been told to write to between one million and two million people who are struggling to cope with debt and have paid no more than their minimum repayment. 'My overdraft cost will nearly double - why am I being punished?' Crippling debt 'linked to depression' Darren received help and is now debt-free, but many people who are in the situation he found himself in are said to be in persistent debt. This is defined as when customers have paid more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period. Previous research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found these cardholders were paying an average of Â£2.50 in interest and charges for every Â£1 of debt they repaid. Under its rules, credit card lenders are supposed to negotiate a manageable and sustainable repayment method and show patience if customers cannot pay the money back. As of March, they also have the option of cancelling cards as a last resort. But now, the FCA is worried that providers will jump straight to a wide-ranging programme of simply stopping the cards, without proper justification. This holds the danger of making a bad situation even worse by cutting off access to credit. The regulator has written to the firms to express its concern that many of them could be planning a blanket suspension. ""If we find firms are not offering their customers the appropriate level of help, we will not hesitate to take action,"" said Jonathan Davidson, from the FCA. 'If the firms do this right, we estimate that this could save customers up to Â£1.3bn a year in lower interest charges.' Debt advice groups and charities said people in these kinds of debt should not panic, but nor should they ignore letters from their credit card company. Instead, they should seek help. ""New rules mean that they have to tell you when your repayments have been going more towards interest, charges and fees than the amount you actually owe,"" said Andrew Johnson, from the Money and Pensions Service. ""You might be encouraged to increase your payments but if this would cause you more financial difficulty they have to offer you help."" The service hasa guide on where to find free debt advice,external. A customer who borrows Â£3,000 on a credit card with an APR of 19%, and only makes minimum repayments - starting at Â£74 per month and reducing over time - would typically take 27 years and seven months to pay it off (assuming there is no further spending on the card). The interest paid would be Â£4,192 If the customer fixed their repayments at Â£74 per month rather than only making minimum repayments, they would pay it off in five years and two months. The interest paid would be Â£1,576 If they set their monthly repayment at Â£108 per month, they would pay their balance off in three years. The interest paid would be Â£879 Source: FCA report 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?'

Woman cleared of murdering 'controlling' father,"Jessica Breeze said she could not remember stabbing her father A woman who stabbed her ""controlling"" father after suffering years of abuse has been found not guilty of his murder and manslaughter. Jessica Breeze, 20, denied murdering Colin Brady, 49, at the family home in Keith Road, Middlesbrough, in June. Miss Breeze told Teesside Crown Court her father had frequently injured her in regular bouts of violence. He had punched and threatened to kill Miss Breeze and her mother before he was stabbed in the back, jurors heard. The prosecution alleged Miss Breeze had stabbed her father as he was leaving the house. In evidence, the nursery worker recalled how her father would ""kick off"" and ""smash the place up"" if she returned home late. Asked by her barrister, Simon Russell Flint QC, if she ever reported her father's violent outbursts, she replied: ""No. I was scared. I thought it was pointless."" Mr Brady had previous convictions for violence, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He had attacked Miss Breeze's mother, Kelly Breeze, in an assault a police constable said was the worst he had seen. Colin Brady was stabbed during a violent row at the family's home in Middlesbrough last summer The trial had heard that an argument broke out after Miss Breeze's parents discovered she had been secretly seeing her boyfriend when she said she had been at work. During the row, Mr Brady slapped or punched his then 19-year-old daughter several times, before her mother intervened, the court heard. ""He was punching me in the face with his fists,"" Miss Breeze told the jury. ""He said he was going to kill us."" She was one digit away from dialling 999 when he demanded she hand over her phone, the court heard. The court was told she had ""no memory of picking up the knife"". He was taken to hospital with an 18cm-deep wound to his left lung, but could not be saved. Jessica Breeze and her lawyer Sean Grainger spoke outside the court Outside court, Miss Breeze's solicitor, Sean Grainger, said in a statement: ""The jury accepted she was acting in lawful self-defence of herself and her mother when under a sustained and violent attack by her father. ""Further, whilst Jessica was brought up in a highly toxic home environment where she and her mother were regularly subject to extreme physical and emotional abuse by her father, Jessica wishes to make it clear she loved her father, she still does and wishes he was still here. ""She now wishes to rebuild her life, get back to work and move on from the seven-month ordeal she has endured since her arrest."" Following the acquittal, a CPS spokesperson said: ""While there was evidence of a sometimes violent relationship between the victim, Colin Brady, and the defendant, Jessica Breeze, the circumstances of his death made a charge of murder wholly appropriate in this case. ""Regardless of the alleged provocation for the attack, the victim was attacked in the back as he walked away from the defendant. ""He was stabbed with such force that it passed from his back through his entire left lung and into his chest. Despite claims of self-defence by the defendant, the evidence was such that there was a case to answer."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

China admits 'shortcomings' on virus response,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus China's top leadership has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in the country's response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The rare admission came from the Politburo Standing Committee, which called for an improvement in China's emergency management system. It also ordered a ""severe"" crackdown on illegal wildlife markets - where the virus is thought to have emerged. The death toll has risen to 425, with more than 20,000 confirmed cases. ""In response to the shortcomings and deficiencies... we must improve our national emergency management system and improve our abilities in handling urgent and dangerous tasks,"" the report said. ""It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade."" 'Make coronavirus wildlife trade ban permanent' Why are we catching more diseases from animals? How worried should we be? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak The government's initial handling of the outbreak has been widely criticised. Officials have been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus at the start of the outbreak and in some cases, attempting to keep news of it secret. One doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn his fellow colleaguesabout the outbreak late last year was accused of ""making false comments"" and told by police to stop the ""illegal activity"". It was only later in January that the government ordered the virtual lockdown of Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated. This video can not be played The first coronavirus-infected patients arrive at the newly built hospital in Wuhan Other regions close to the mainland are also feeling the effects of the virus first-hand. On Tuesday, Hong Kong confirmed its first death from the coronavirus. Broadcaster RTHK said the 39-year-old man, who suffered from an underlying illness, had visited Wuhan on 21 January. Hong Kong, which has 15 confirmed cases, has suspended 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China. Taiwan announced that starting Friday, it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days. Macau - one of Asia's biggest gambling hubs - also announced that it would temporarily close down all the casinos in the region. The closure is set to last two weeks but could be extended. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. The number of deaths in China, excluding Hong Kong, now exceeds the 349 killed on the mainland in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03. But the mortality rate of the new virus is about 2.1% - much lower than that of Sars at around 9.6% - suggesting it is not as deadly. There are more than 150 cases in other countries, with one death in the Philippines. On Tuesday, South Korea announced that one of its citizens had tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the 42-year-old woman flew back to Korea on 19 January after visiting Thailand. She showed symptoms on 25 January and her conditions did not improve. The Thai Department of Disease Control said it was ""possible"" that she contracted the virus in Thailand, which has one of the highest number of virus cases outside of China.

China admits 'shortcomings' on virus responseThe top leadership says emergency management must improve as the outbreak claims 360 lives.China,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus China's top leadership has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in the country's response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The rare admission came from the Politburo Standing Committee, which called for an improvement in China's emergency management system. It also ordered a ""severe"" crackdown on illegal wildlife markets - where the virus is thought to have emerged. The death toll has risen to 425, with more than 20,000 confirmed cases. ""In response to the shortcomings and deficiencies... we must improve our national emergency management system and improve our abilities in handling urgent and dangerous tasks,"" the report said. ""It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade."" 'Make coronavirus wildlife trade ban permanent' Why are we catching more diseases from animals? How worried should we be? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak The government's initial handling of the outbreak has been widely criticised. Officials have been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus at the start of the outbreak and in some cases, attempting to keep news of it secret. One doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn his fellow colleaguesabout the outbreak late last year was accused of ""making false comments"" and told by police to stop the ""illegal activity"". It was only later in January that the government ordered the virtual lockdown of Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated. This video can not be played The first coronavirus-infected patients arrive at the newly built hospital in Wuhan Other regions close to the mainland are also feeling the effects of the virus first-hand. On Tuesday, Hong Kong confirmed its first death from the coronavirus. Broadcaster RTHK said the 39-year-old man, who suffered from an underlying illness, had visited Wuhan on 21 January. Hong Kong, which has 15 confirmed cases, has suspended 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China. Taiwan announced that starting Friday, it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days. Macau - one of Asia's biggest gambling hubs - also announced that it would temporarily close down all the casinos in the region. The closure is set to last two weeks but could be extended. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. The number of deaths in China, excluding Hong Kong, now exceeds the 349 killed on the mainland in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03. But the mortality rate of the new virus is about 2.1% - much lower than that of Sars at around 9.6% - suggesting it is not as deadly. There are more than 150 cases in other countries, with one death in the Philippines. On Tuesday, South Korea announced that one of its citizens had tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the 42-year-old woman flew back to Korea on 19 January after visiting Thailand. She showed symptoms on 25 January and her conditions did not improve. The Thai Department of Disease Control said it was ""possible"" that she contracted the virus in Thailand, which has one of the highest number of virus cases outside of China. It is not clear if she had visited China at all. Many nations have evacuated their citizens from affected areas of China, often placing them in quarantine on arrival home. The US ordered the departure of all US personnel family members under the age of 21, and any US citizen who has been in Hubei province will be subject to 14 days' quarantine.

Woman cleared of murdering 'controlling' fatherJessica Breeze said she could not remember stabbing her father during a struggle in the family home.Tees,"Jessica Breeze said she could not remember stabbing her father A woman who stabbed her ""controlling"" father after suffering years of abuse has been found not guilty of his murder and manslaughter. Jessica Breeze, 20, denied murdering Colin Brady, 49, at the family home in Keith Road, Middlesbrough, in June. Miss Breeze told Teesside Crown Court her father had frequently injured her in regular bouts of violence. He had punched and threatened to kill Miss Breeze and her mother before he was stabbed in the back, jurors heard. The prosecution alleged Miss Breeze had stabbed her father as he was leaving the house. In evidence, the nursery worker recalled how her father would ""kick off"" and ""smash the place up"" if she returned home late. Asked by her barrister, Simon Russell Flint QC, if she ever reported her father's violent outbursts, she replied: ""No. I was scared. I thought it was pointless."" Mr Brady had previous convictions for violence, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He had attacked Miss Breeze's mother, Kelly Breeze, in an assault a police constable said was the worst he had seen. Colin Brady was stabbed during a violent row at the family's home in Middlesbrough last summer The trial had heard that an argument broke out after Miss Breeze's parents discovered she had been secretly seeing her boyfriend when she said she had been at work. During the row, Mr Brady slapped or punched his then 19-year-old daughter several times, before her mother intervened, the court heard. ""He was punching me in the face with his fists,"" Miss Breeze told the jury. ""He said he was going to kill us."" She was one digit away from dialling 999 when he demanded she hand over her phone, the court heard. The court was told she had ""no memory of picking up the knife"". He was taken to hospital with an 18cm-deep wound to his left lung, but could not be saved. Jessica Breeze and her lawyer Sean Grainger spoke outside the court Outside court, Miss Breeze's solicitor, Sean Grainger, said in a statement: ""The jury accepted she was acting in lawful self-defence of herself and her mother when under a sustained and violent attack by her father. ""Further, whilst Jessica was brought up in a highly toxic home environment where she and her mother were regularly subject to extreme physical and emotional abuse by her father, Jessica wishes to make it clear she loved her father, she still does and wishes he was still here. ""She now wishes to rebuild her life, get back to work and move on from the seven-month ordeal she has endured since her arrest."" Following the acquittal, a CPS spokesperson said: ""While there was evidence of a sometimes violent relationship between the victim, Colin Brady, and the defendant, Jessica Breeze, the circumstances of his death made a charge of murder wholly appropriate in this case. ""Regardless of the alleged provocation for the attack, the victim was attacked in the back as he walked away from the defendant. ""He was stabbed with such force that it passed from his back through his entire left lung and into his chest. Despite claims of self-defence by the defendant, the evidence was such that there was a case to answer."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Eyewitness: 'I gave them a blanket to stem the bleeding',"Dave Chawner speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Eyewitnesses have described scenes of distress and panic when a man was shot dead by police after stabbing people in Streatham, London. They told the BBC how they fled at the sound of gunshots on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. Three people were injured in the attack - carried out by Sudesh Amman, 20 - but none is in a critical condition. One man said he gave people looking after one of the victims a blanket to ""help stem the bleeding"". Dave Chawner, who had been on the way to the cinema, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I heard what I thought at that time was a car backfiring. Police search homes in Streatham attack probe Streatham attacker named as Sudesh Amman Who was Sudesh Amman? ""I turned back and turned round and saw a small group of people around a man who was on the floor who was incredibly distressed, he was holding his lower right quadrant and there was blood everywhere. ""I happened to have a blanket in my bag and I gave it to them to help stem the bleeding and I ran to the nearest crossroads to wave down the ambulance."" Mr Chawner said the ambulance ""took well over half an hour to arrive"", which was ""incredibly frustrating and distressing"". London Ambulance Servicesaid its medics were at the scene in four minutes,external, but were sent to a rendezvous point until police told them it was safe to treat patients. People gathered near the scene in Streatham Adam Blake, who was walking along Streatham Common, described how he saw two or three cars crash into each other, including an unmarked police car, as the incident unfolded. ""Another police car carried on towards the hill pursuing someone,"" he told the BBC. A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the floor outside Boots Gjon Kathegjolli said he was in a barber shop when he heard a woman, who was with a baby in a push chair and two young boys, scream and saw her being stabbed. A man then walked past carrying a knife the size of his forearm, he said. Daniel Gough said he was out for a run when he heard shots and everyone ran. ""There was panic, people were yelling,"" he said. ""A young girl running alongside me kept asking 'Is this what I'm meant to do?' - she was very distressed. ""I saw a policeman and he yelled, telling everyone to get back. His gun was pointing in the direction of a man on the floor.""

""I don't think it's really sunk in,"" she said, adding that residents had ""come together"" in the aftermath. Lee Ford Lee Ford, a local electrician, said: ""To see this happen on my doorstep - our doorstep - it's very shocking.""

China accuses US of spreading coronavirus 'panic',"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus The Chinese government has accused the US of causing ""panic"" in its response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. It follows the US decision to declare a public health emergency and deny entry to foreign nationals who had visited China in the past two weeks. There are more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the virus in China. Some 361 people have died there. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases of the virus - and one death, in the Philippines. US bars foreigners who recently visited China Coronavirus: How worried should we be?

This video can not be played Shanghai is unusually quiet as businesses temporarily close and people choose to stay inside On Monday,a stud, published in Nature, by a Chinese virologist said a pneumonia outbreak associated with the coronavirus had likely started in bats.,external One Briton 'fell ill' during Wuhan evacuation flight The outbreak took its toll on Chinese shares when markets reopened on Monday following the Lunar New Year holiday. The Shanghai Composite index closed nearly 8% lower,its biggest daily drop for more than four years. On 23 January, the US ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus originated. Less than a week later, the US allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency personnel and relatives of US government employees from China. On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the new virus. Following this, the US ordered the departure of all US personnel family members under the age of 21 in China. Any US citizen who has been in Hubei province will be subject to 14 days' quarantine upon returning to the US. On Monday, Hong Kong said it was suspending from midnight local time (16:00 GMT) 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China.

In a news briefing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the US actions ""could only create and spread fear"" instead of offering assistance. She said the US was the first country to impose a travel ban on Chinese travellers and the first to suggest a partial withdrawal of its embassy staff. ""It is precisely developed countries like the US with strong epidemic prevention capabilities... that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,"" Ms Hua said, according to a Reuters report. But Ms Hua also said that China urgently needed ""medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles"".

Coronavirus fear hits London's Chinatown ""Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,"" the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week. The WHO instead recommends introducing screening at border crossings. On Monday, Dr Tedros again praised China for its commitment to fighting the coronavirus, stressing that the only way to defeat it was for all countries to work together ""in a spirit of co-operation"". More than 75,000 people may have been infected in the city of Wuhan, experts say. But estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than the official figures. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began A report on the early stages of the outbreak by the Lancet medical journal said most patients who died from the virus had pre-existing conditions. The report found that, of the first 99 patients treated at the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, 40 had a weak heart or damaged blood vessels. A further 12 had diabetes. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a normal flu.

"'I was Â£32,000 in debt, it consumed every moment'As one man tells of his struggles with debt, the regulator issues a warning to credit card firms.","Darren received help for his money problems and is now debt-free After taking out one loan after another, then adding credit card debt, Darren had borrowed Â£32,000 he could not pay back. The 44-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, was juggling minimum payments and was struggling to cope. ""I was not reducing the debt, it was just going up month after month, year after year,"" he said. ""I had all the highs of spending the money, but when I was low, it was low. It consumes every thought, every moment of the day just worrying about debt. It was awful."" Credit card companies have been told to write to between one million and two million people who are struggling to cope with debt and have paid no more than their minimum repayment. 'My overdraft cost will nearly double - why am I being punished?' Crippling debt 'linked to depression' Darren received help and is now debt-free, but many people who are in the situation he found himself in are said to be in persistent debt. This is defined as when customers have paid more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period. Previous research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found these cardholders were paying an average of Â£2.50 in interest and charges for every Â£1 of debt they repaid. Under its rules, credit card lenders are supposed to negotiate a manageable and sustainable repayment method and show patience if customers cannot pay the money back. As of March, they also have the option of cancelling cards as a last resort. But now, the FCA is worried that providers will jump straight to a wide-ranging programme of simply stopping the cards, without proper justification. This holds the danger of making a bad situation even worse by cutting off access to credit. The regulator has written to the firms to express its concern that many of them could be planning a blanket suspension. ""If we find firms are not offering their customers the appropriate level of help, we will not hesitate to take action,"" said Jonathan Davidson, from the FCA. 'If the firms do this right, we estimate that this could save customers up to Â£1.3bn a year in lower interest charges.' Debt advice groups and charities said people in these kinds of debt should not panic, but nor should they ignore letters from their credit card company. Instead, they should seek help. ""New rules mean that they have to tell you when your repayments have been going more towards interest, charges and fees than the amount you actually owe,"" said Andrew Johnson, from the Money and Pensions Service. ""You might be encouraged to increase your payments but if this would cause you more financial difficulty they have to offer you help."" The service hasa guide on where to find free debt advice,external. A customer who borrows Â£3,000 on a credit card with an APR of 19%, and only makes minimum repayments - starting at Â£74 per month and reducing over time - would typically take 27 years and seven months to pay it off (assuming there is no further spending on the card). The interest paid would be Â£4,192 If the customer fixed their repayments at Â£74 per month rather than only making minimum repayments, they would pay it off in five years and two months. The interest paid would be Â£1,576 If they set their monthly repayment at Â£108 per month, they would pay their balance off in three years. The interest paid would be Â£879 Source: FCA report 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?'

Police search Streatham knife attacker's hostel,"Police have been searching the London hostel where the Streatham attacker is believed to have been living. Sudesh Amman, 20, was shot dead by police on Streatham High Road after stabbing people in what police called an Islamist-related terrorist incident. He had been released from prison about a week ago after serving half of a sentence for terror offences, and was under police surveillance. Three people were injured but none is in a life-threatening condition. Scotland Yard said officers were searching residential addresses in south London and Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. On Monday, officers were seen cordoning off a hostel in Streatham, where the manager said Amman had been living. He added: ""I didn't have much to do with him. ""Everyone has their own rooms in there. The last time I saw him I was doing his radiator, setting up his heating on Friday. He didn't speak much."" Amman's mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, told Sky News that she had visited her son,externalon Thursday, when he seemed ""normal"", and that they spoke on the phone just hours before the attack. She fought back tears as she said her ""polite and lovely boy"" had been ""brainwashed"" by material he saw online and further radicalised by his time in the high security Belmarsh prison in south-east London. There is a police presence at a hostel in Streatham Streatham High Road remained shut on Monday, with enhanced police patrols In Bishop's Stortford, neighbours said two police vans were outside a semi-detached house in the early hours of the morning. The Met Police, whose Counter Terrorism Command officers are leading the investigation, said no arrests had been made and ""inquiries continue at pace"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there were about ""70 plus"" people convicted of terrorism offences who had been released, and called for reassurances from the government they were being ""properly punished and reformed"". He said prisons are ""warehouses"" for radicalisation, where people ""learn more things from a university of crime rather than being rehabilitated"". 'I didn't stop shaking for hours' How many people are in prison for terror offences? What do prisons do to deradicalise terror offenders? Why do prisoners serve only half their sentence? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there were problems with the rehabilitation of those convicted of terrorist offences, saying: ""It's very, very hard. It can happen that the instances of success are really very few, we have to be frank about that."" He said new laws would scrap automatic early release from prison for terror offenders, the ""difficulty is how to apply that retrospectively"" for those currently serving sentences. At about 14:00 GMT on Sunday, two people were stabbed on Streatham High Road in south London, a busy street lined with shops. Witnesses heard gunshots as armed officers, who had been following Amman on foot, shot him dead. This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting Amman had what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, police said, which was later discovered to be a hoax. Three people were taken to hospitals including the two stabbing victims - a woman in her 50s and a man in his 40s. The man was initially considered to be in a life-threatening condition, but that is no longer the case. The woman has been discharged. Another woman in her 20s had minor injuries believed to have been caused by glass following the gun shots. Eyewitness Dave Chawner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he heard the shots and then turned around to see one of the stab victims lying on the floor ""who was incredibly distressed"". ""He was holding his lower right quadrant and there was blood everywhere. I happened to have a blanket in my bag and I gave it to them to help stem the bleeding."" A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the ground outside Boots Read more from eyewitnesses. Amman was released from prison in January, after serving half of his sentence of three years and four months. He was jailed in December 2018 after pleading guilty to terror offences. The Islamic State group has said Amman was a ""fighter"" of the group. This is the wording IS commonly uses in the case of attacks in the West that the group appears to have inspired rather than orchestrated. Read more: Who was Streatham attacker? A teenager who knew Amman from his neighbourhood in Harrow, but who did not want to give her name, said he used to talk about being a terrorist, but she and others thought he was joking. But Jignesh Khomani, 20, a former neighbour of Amman, said he seemed ""a pretty average guy"". At the time of Amman's release, there were concerns about the danger he might pose to the public but there were no legal mechanisms to keep him in prison, said BBC political correspondent Chris Mason. Last November,an attack near London Bridge- in which two people died - was also carried out by a man convicted of terrorism offences but who had been released mid-way through his sentence. People who live locally spoke of their shock at the attack having taken place in Streatham Mr Khan, the London Mayor, said he was ""angry"" because both the attack in Streatham and the one in London Bridge were ""preventable and foreseeable"". He blamed the government's abolition of the Imprisonment for Public Protection regime, which meant that now ""judges haven't got the tools they used to have to keep people in prison longer who are still a danger to the public"". Our correspondent Chris Mason said there was ""a desperate desire"" within government to be seen to be acting quickly. Mr Johnson said on Monday the government would announce further plans for ""fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences"". The planned changes mean automatic early release from prison will be scrapped for terror offenders, and there will be a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious terror offences. Jonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the government might intend to revive post-9/11 civil powers to detain individuals. That would mean people who were considered to be a risk but had not committed an offence could be detained, he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Overall there were 224 people in prison for terror-related offences in Britain at the end of September. The majority are Islamist extremists (173), and there are also 38 far-right extremists. Currently, most people convicted of terror acts will not serve all of their sentence in jail. For almost all prison sentences (terror-related or not), some of the time will be spent outside jail in order to allow some rehabilitation back into the community. There would be inevitable questions about the operation, said BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. He said: ""Preventing terrorism is all about taking difficult decisions. Which suspects should be watched? What level of risk do they pose and when is the best time to make an arrest, given the need to capture real evidence? ""Those decisions have become harder in recent years as would-be attackers are increasingly likely to act alone and to use low-tech weapons, sometimes on a whim."" This video can not be played Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said armed officers were in ""immediate attendance"" after the attack David Merritt, whose son Jack died in November's London Bridge attack, said that without effective rehabilitation, the government'splans for longer terrorism sentences would only allow prisoners to radicalise each other,externaland ""build greater resentment"". But former military intelligence officer Philip Ingram told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""right and proper"" that the government should assess the laws in place. ""You have to ask the question as to whether some of them may not ever be able to be rehabilitated and, therefore, is the law we have at the moment right and proper to keep the public safe?""

Universal credit rollout delayed to 2024,"Stories like Paula's, whose first universal credit payment wasn't enough to live on, are thought to have ""scared people"" Full rollout of universal credit, the government's flagship welfare reform, is being delayed again, adding Â£500m to its overall cost, the BBC has learned. Officials say not enough people are moving to the benefit as they are ""scared"" to move to universal credit. The system was meant to be fully live by April 2017, but the new delay will push it back to September 2024. The welfare delivery minister, Will Quince, said claimants would not lose money as a result of the change. Full rollout had already been put back to 2023 What is universal credit - and what's the problem? The backroom discussions leading to the latest delay were recorded by a BBC team whose series,Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State, starts on Tuesday. The new benefit, which replaces six existing payments, has been beset by problems, with claimants having to wait at least five weeks for the payments to start and many reports of people falling into debt, and having to resort to food banks as a consequence. People transferring to universal credit have to wait five weeks for the first payment On top of that, advance payments of the benefit, introduced to help people through the five weeks with no money coming in, have been blamed for putting claimants into debt. That's because once the benefit finally comes through, payments are reduced to pay off the advance. Claimants are meant to transfer onto universal credit when they have a change of circumstances, such as moving in with a new partner. The film-makers were allowed access to meetings inside the Department for Work and Pensions, and officials are seen pondering what to do when they realise fewer people are reporting changes of circumstances and therefore being transferred to the new benefit, than expected. One programme shows Bolton mum Paula struggling to feed her family when her first universal credit payment comes in at just over Â£500 for a month, because of deductions to pay off the advance she took during the five-week wait. She ends up resorting to a food bank. ""I have just got myself into one big mess and I have lost control over everything,"" Paula tells a debt counsellor. ""I am in debt up to my eyeballs and it's not going to go away."" Paula was referred to a food bank The counsellor tells her: ""Any customer on universal credit, we already know that you're standing on the back foot. ""If you don't have money saved up already or you don't have backup of family who can support you, you will fall into taking an advance payment."" She added that benefit deductions to pay off the advance, leave people ""constantly trying to catch up"". Neil Couling, the senior civil servant in charge of the rollout for the past five years, is filmed telling a Whitehall meeting: ""We've got a lot of anecdotal evidence of people being scared to come to universal credit. ""It's a potentially serious issue for us, in terms of completing the project by December 2023, but I'm urging people not to panic."" ""I'll take the beating"": senior civil servant Neil Couling decides to delay full rollout by another nine months But a few weeks later, in September 2019, he decides to delay full rollout to September 2024, putting Â£500m on the bill. ""Three, six or nine months, it doesn't matter - the headline will be: 'Delay, disaster',"" he says ""I would say, 'Go safe, put the claimants first, and I'll take the beating.'"" Despite the problems, Mr Couling says he believes that once universal credit is fully implemented, it will be successful and regarded as ""the right thing to do"". ""This is the system that will form the bedrock of social security for the next 30 years."" He expects universal credit to continue to grow, with 2.6 million people already on it by September last year: ""Right now there's no way I can put the brakes on and stop. ""I have to keep going to the destination or you have to set me a different destination, because there's 2.6 million people, and if we get something wrong we could disrupt their lives and they've got no alternative. There's no alternative bank they can go to get help. We are the payer of last resort."" Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, called the news ""hugely embarrassing"" for the government and called for universal credit to be scrapped. ""Universal credit was supposed to be its flagship social security programme. ""Instead we now find that it is being forced to delay the full rollout because the public have so very little faith in it and many are actually afraid of it,"" said Ms Greenwood. The government says universal credit was always intended to be introduced slowly. It is ""the biggest change to the welfare system in a generation, bringing together six overlapping benefits into one monthly payment and offering support to some of the most vulnerable people in society"", said Mr Quince. ""It is right that we revisit our forecasts and plan, and re-plan accordingly, ensuring that the process is working well for people on benefits.""

"Debt: 'It consumes every thought, every moment'","Darren received help for his money problems and is now debt-free After taking out one loan after another, then adding credit card debt, Darren had borrowed Â£32,000 he could not pay back. The 44-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, was juggling minimum payments and was struggling to cope. ""I was not reducing the debt, it was just going up month after month, year after year,"" he said. ""I had all the highs of spending the money, but when I was low, it was low. It consumes every thought, every moment of the day just worrying about debt. It was awful."" Credit card companies have been told to write to between one million and two million people who are struggling to cope with debt and have paid no more than their minimum repayment. 'My overdraft cost will nearly double - why am I being punished?' Crippling debt 'linked to depression' Darren received help and is now debt-free, but many people who are in the situation he found himself in are said to be in persistent debt. This is defined as when customers have paid more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period. Previous research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found these cardholders were paying an average of Â£2.50 in interest and charges for every Â£1 of debt they repaid. Under its rules, credit card lenders are supposed to negotiate a manageable and sustainable repayment method and show patience if customers cannot pay the money back. As of March, they also have the option of cancelling cards as a last resort. But now, the FCA is worried that providers will jump straight to a wide-ranging programme of simply stopping the cards, without proper justification. This holds the danger of making a bad situation even worse by cutting off access to credit. The regulator has written to the firms to express its concern that many of them could be planning a blanket suspension. ""If we find firms are not offering their customers the appropriate level of help, we will not hesitate to take action,"" said Jonathan Davidson, from the FCA. 'If the firms do this right, we estimate that this could save customers up to Â£1.3bn a year in lower interest charges.' Debt advice groups and charities said people in these kinds of debt should not panic, but nor should they ignore letters from their credit card company. Instead, they should seek help. ""New rules mean that they have to tell you when your repayments have been going more towards interest, charges and fees than the amount you actually owe,"" said Andrew Johnson, from the Money and Pensions Service. ""You might be encouraged to increase your payments but if this would cause you more financial difficulty they have to offer you help."" The service hasa guide on where to find free debt advice,external. A customer who borrows Â£3,000 on a credit card with an APR of 19%, and only makes minimum repayments - starting at Â£74 per month and reducing over time - would typically take 27 years and seven months to pay it off (assuming there is no further spending on the card). The interest paid would be Â£4,192 If the customer fixed their repayments at Â£74 per month rather than only making minimum repayments, they would pay it off in five years and two months. The interest paid would be Â£1,576 If they set their monthly repayment at Â£108 per month, they would pay their balance off in three years. The interest paid would be Â£879 Source: FCA report 'Why are my overdraft costs doubling?'

'I gave them a blanket to help stem the bleeding',"Dave Chawner speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Eyewitnesses have described scenes of distress and panic when a man was shot dead by police after stabbing people in Streatham, London. They told the BBC how they fled at the sound of gunshots on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. Three people were injured in the attack - carried out by Sudesh Amman, 20 - but none is in a critical condition. One man said he gave people looking after one of the victims a blanket to ""help stem the bleeding"". Dave Chawner, who had been on the way to the cinema, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I heard what I thought at that time was a car backfiring. Police search homes in Streatham attack probe Streatham attacker named as Sudesh Amman Who was Sudesh Amman? ""I turned back and turned round and saw a small group of people around a man who was on the floor who was incredibly distressed, he was holding his lower right quadrant and there was blood everywhere. ""I happened to have a blanket in my bag and I gave it to them to help stem the bleeding and I ran to the nearest crossroads to wave down the ambulance."" Mr Chawner said the ambulance ""took well over half an hour to arrive"", which was ""incredibly frustrating and distressing"". London Ambulance Servicesaid its medics were at the scene in four minutes,external, but were sent to a rendezvous point until police told them it was safe to treat patients.

Mercenary 'Mad Mike' Hoare dies aged 100,"Mike Hoare, seen here with his bodyguard in 1964, was internationally renowned until his career ended in an embarrassing anti-climax Michael ""Mad Mike"" Hoare, widely considered the world's best known mercenary, has died aged 100. Born in India to Irish parents, he led campaigns in the Congo in the 1960s that earned him fame at the time, and a controversial legacy years later. His career reached an embarrassing end in 1981, when he was jailed for leading a failed coup in the Seychelles. Mr Hoare's son, Chris Hoare, said in a statement that his father died in a care facility in Durban, South Africa. ""Mike Hoare lived by the philosophy that you get more out of life by living dangerously, so it is all the more remarkable that he lived more than 100 years,"" he said. After serving in the British Army during the Second World War and reaching the rank of major, Mr Hoare began his post-war career as an accountant, running several small businesses in South Africa. But it was in 1961 that he was introduced to MoÃ¯se Tshombe - a Congolese politician and businessman who would go on to become prime minister of the Congo three years later. In 1964, Mr Tshombe hired Mr Hoare to take on the communist-backed Simba rebellion. When the campaign was completed 18 months later, Mr Hoare and his unit of mercenaries - which he nicknamed the ""Wild Geese"" - were internationally known. His fervent anti-communist beliefs earned him no fans in many nations, with East German radio regularly describing him as ""that mad bloodhound Hoare"". This led to him being nicknamed ""Mad Mike"" - a moniker with which he was delighted. In 1978, a mercenary adventure film called The Wild Geese was released. The film starred Richard Burton as Colonel Allen Faulkner, a character based heavily on Mr Hoare. Actors Richard Harris, Roger Moore, Richard Burton and Hardy KrÃ¼ger starred in the 1978 film The Wild Geese, based on Mike Hoare's mercenaries But following his successful campaigns in the Congo, what came next turned him into an international laughing stock. Mr Hoare appeared to be retired from military life by the start of the 1980s - but in 1981 he launched a surprise attempt at overthrowing the government of the Seychelles. It is believed that Mr Hoare knew the Seychelles well, and had a particular hatred of its socialist government under President Albert RenÃ©. Having gained the tacit support of the governments of South Africa and Kenya, Mr Hoare began to plot. In October 1981 he had a cache of weapons delivered to his suburban bungalow in South Africa, which he hid in his cellar. He recruited 46 men, and with them he planned to enter the Seychelles disguised as a charitable drinking club of former rugby players. Almost all of the men managed to get through customs at Mahe airport. However, one of their group joined the wrong queue, got into an argument with a customs officer, and ended up having his bag searched. When officers found a dismantled AK-47, the man panicked and revealed that there were more weapons outside. At this point the entire plan unravelled, and amid the ensuing conflict at the airport the mercenaries commandeered an Air India plane and flew it back to South Africa. When they arrived the mercenaries were jailed for six days, and Mr Hoare and his plans - dubbed ""the package-holiday coup"" - were ridiculed in the global press. A year later they were tried for hijacking the Air India plane. Mr Hoare was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years suspended. He was released after 33 months. Mr Hoare spent his final years in South Africa, and published several memoirs - including Mercenary, The Road to Kalamata, and The Seychelles Affair.

Minister unveils Â£23m welfare scheme extension,"Michelle O'Neill and Deirdre Hargey announced the proposals at Stormont on Monday Plans for an extension of welfare mitigations to the so-called bedroom tax have been announced by the minister for communities. The scheme currently provides financial support to people who would otherwise have faced welfare cuts. But it was due to run out on 31 March. About 38,000 households in Northern Ireland are in receipt of supplementary payments, which protect them from the tax, the Department for Communities said. The minister Deirdre Hargey said the proposal would cost Â£23m per annum. ""We have a responsibility to protect the poorest and most vulnerable in society,"" said Ms Hargey. She said the executive agreed her recommendation on Monday. It was first outlined inNew Decade, New Approach,external- the deal that restored devolution after three years of political deadlock in Northern Ireland. ""A society is judged on how we protect the most disadvantaged,"" she added. ""I am a minister who will fight to protect those families living in poverty; low-income families, single-parent families, those with disabilities and children and young people.  I am working hard to target resources towards those most in need.""

Battle to beat Trump begins as Iowa votesThe race to become the Democratic nominee for the US election starts with the Iowa caucuses.US & Canada,"The spotlight is on Sanders in Iowa: will he shine? The first event that will help decide the candidates for US president is to take place with Monday's Iowa caucuses. Democratic and Republican voters will choose their preferred nominees for the White House race. While victory in Iowa doesn't guarantee anyone the nomination, it can help give them crucial momentum. The path appears clear for Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee, but 11 candidates are running for the Democratic nomination. Many have spent the past few weeks vigorously campaigning in the Midwest state, which is always the first to vote. The primaries contest goes on until early June, and moves on to New Hampshire next Tuesday. Here's the story of what to expect in Iowa, broken down. Polls suggest that Bernie Sanders has risen to be the favourite in Iowa (or - depending where you look - the joint-favourite, with former vice-president Joe Biden). He is one of four senators running for president who have had to stay behind in Washington to attend Mr Trump's impeachment trial, but his supporters, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known congresswoman, have been energetically campaigning on his behalf in Iowa. How do caucuses and primaries work? Is this the start of a Bernie boom? Four years after losing out to Hillary Clinton, could this be the 78-year-old's time? He is backed by a huge pot of donations and a team of hundreds. But if he won the nomination, would moderate Democrats really rally around a candidate for the White House who identifies as a democratic socialist? Some of the other big names including Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg will be hoping Mr Sanders doesn't have it all his own way in Iowa. This video can not be played How Iowa is like the luge: An unconventional guide to the caucuses There are also Republican caucuses on Monday, and two people are running against Mr Trump, but the president's popularity within his own party is such that his nomination is all but a formality. Iowa, to some extent, provides a glimpse of what went wrong for Democrats in 2016. In the last election, more than 200 US counties flipped from supporting President Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Mr Trump - and 31 of those counties were in Iowa. Democrats will be hoping to lure back those swing voters in 2020. And while we won't know until November whether they have been successful, we may get a glimpse of where the land lies on Monday. Howard County in northern Iowa flipped by 41 percentage points in 2016, the largest change in the US. The BBC's AngÃ©lica Casas and Marianna Brady went there to ask people whether they would vote for a Democrat in 2020. This video can not be played âWe voted for Obama, then Trumpâ Does Iowa actually matter? It depends how you look at it. As the primary season curtain-raiser, Iowa can help shape perceptions among voters. A win here can help give a candidate momentum early in the race (as it did in 1976 with Jimmy Carter) and erase any doubts about their viability. Candidates' secret weapons against Trump Nine odd things about the Iowa caucuses While Iowans have a good record at picking the eventual Democratic nominee, their record when it comes to the Republican candidate is more mixed. When it's an open Republican race (unlike this year, for example), none of the winners of Iowa has become the Republican nominee since 2000. It's worth pointing out that Iowa isn't the most diverse of states either - the rest of America will vote very differently in upcoming primaries and caucuses. So says Ann Anhalt, from Des Moines,who plans to vote for tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang on Monday. But this is exactly what a caucus involves - they are essentially internal party meetings, scattered across the state, that might last a few hours. At some point during the meeting, you have to show your support for a candidate. You do this by standing next to others who also support that candidate, and a count takes place. What's at stake is delegates - 41 Democratic ones in Iowa - distributed according to how well candidates performed in the caucuses. If candidate A is awarded 10 delegates, those delegates would later vote for candidate A as the Democratic nominee at the summer convention - the aim for any candidate is to gain as many delegates as possible over the primary season. Gina Weekley, 36 - Youth advocate from Waterloo, Iowa I'm married to a woman, so my livelihood and happiness is at stake in this election. My family's future is at stake in this election. And our freedom as Americans is at stake. We need a strong leader to emerge as the Democratic nominee. Someone with great passion and energy who can unify the United States. The division and hate messages that we've seen under the Trump presidency needs to end. We don't currently have a leader that works for all Americans. I'm caucusing so that future generations can access quality education. We need a president who helps ""at risk"" youth get the proper services they need so they don't fall victim to the school-to-prison pipeline. At each of the 1,677 locations across the state, a candidate must have the support of at least 15% of voters in order to qualify for a chance to win Iowa delegates to the national convention in July - when the candidate is ultimately picked. After a first round of tabulations, those who support a candidate that doesn't reach ""viability"" have the opportunity to switch sides. Complicating everything is the new reporting system the Democratic Party has instituted for the Iowa caucus results. In the past, the party has only released one number - the final tabulation of support after all the caucus horse-trading and support swapping takes place. This time, however, there will be two sets of numbers - the final tally as well as a count of each candidate's support in the first round of balloting. That means two - or more! - candidates could be on stage declaring victory on Monday night. It has the makings for a long, chaotic night - the first of what could be many for the candidates still standing after the Iowa dust settles.

Police search homes in Streatham attack probe,"Police have been searching the London hostel where the Streatham attacker is believed to have been living. Sudesh Amman, 20, was shot dead by police on Streatham High Road after stabbing people in what police called an Islamist-related terrorist incident. He had been released from prison about a week ago after serving half of a sentence for terror offences, and was under police surveillance. Three people were injured but none is in a life-threatening condition. Scotland Yard said officers were searching residential addresses in south London and Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. On Monday, officers were seen cordoning off a hostel in Streatham, where the manager said Amman had been living. He added: ""I didn't have much to do with him. ""Everyone has their own rooms in there. The last time I saw him I was doing his radiator, setting up his heating on Friday. He didn't speak much."" Amman's mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, told Sky News that she had visited her son,externalon Thursday, when he seemed ""normal"", and that they spoke on the phone just hours before the attack. She fought back tears as she said her ""polite and lovely boy"" had been ""brainwashed"" by material he saw online and further radicalised by his time in the high security Belmarsh prison in south-east London. There is a police presence at a hostel in Streatham Streatham High Road remained shut on Monday, with enhanced police patrols In Bishop's Stortford, neighbours said two police vans were outside a semi-detached house in the early hours of the morning. The Met Police, whose Counter Terrorism Command officers are leading the investigation, said no arrests had been made and ""inquiries continue at pace"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there were about ""70 plus"" people convicted of terrorism offences who had been released, and called for reassurances from the government they were being ""properly punished and reformed"". He said prisons are ""warehouses"" for radicalisation, where people ""learn more things from a university of crime rather than being rehabilitated"". 'I didn't stop shaking for hours' How many people are in prison for terror offences? What do prisons do to deradicalise terror offenders? Why do prisoners serve only half their sentence? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there were problems with the rehabilitation of those convicted of terrorist offences, saying: ""It's very, very hard. It can happen that the instances of success are really very few, we have to be frank about that."" He said new laws would scrap automatic early release from prison for terror offenders, the ""difficulty is how to apply that retrospectively"" for those currently serving sentences. At about 14:00 GMT on Sunday, two people were stabbed on Streatham High Road in south London, a busy street lined with shops. Witnesses heard gunshots as armed officers, who had been following Amman on foot, shot him dead. This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting Amman had what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, police said, which was later discovered to be a hoax. Three people were taken to hospitals including the two stabbing victims - a woman in her 50s and a man in his 40s. The man was initially considered to be in a life-threatening condition, but that is no longer the case. The woman has been discharged. Another woman in her 20s had minor injuries believed to have been caused by glass following the gun shots. Eyewitness Dave Chawner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he heard the shots and then turned around to see one of the stab victims lying on the floor ""who was incredibly distressed"". ""He was holding his lower right quadrant and there was blood everywhere. I happened to have a blanket in my bag and I gave it to them to help stem the bleeding."" A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the ground outside Boots Read more from eyewitnesses. Amman was released from prison in January, after serving half of his sentence of three years and four months. He was jailed in December 2018 after pleading guilty to terror offences. The Islamic State group has said Amman was a ""fighter"" of the group. This is the wording IS commonly uses in the case of attacks in the West that the group appears to have inspired rather than orchestrated. Read more: Who was Streatham attacker? A teenager who knew Amman from his neighbourhood in Harrow, but who did not want to give her name, said he used to talk about being a terrorist, but she and others thought he was joking. But Jignesh Khomani, 20, a former neighbour of Amman, said he seemed ""a pretty average guy"". At the time of Amman's release, there were concerns about the danger he might pose to the public but there were no legal mechanisms to keep him in prison, said BBC political correspondent Chris Mason. Last November,an attack near London Bridge- in which two people died - was also carried out by a man convicted of terrorism offences but who had been released mid-way through his sentence. People who live locally spoke of their shock at the attack having taken place in Streatham Mr Khan, the London Mayor, said he was ""angry"" because both the attack in Streatham and the one in London Bridge were ""preventable and foreseeable"". He blamed the government's abolition of the Imprisonment for Public Protection regime, which meant that now ""judges haven't got the tools they used to have to keep people in prison longer who are still a danger to the public"". Our correspondent Chris Mason said there was ""a desperate desire"" within government to be seen to be acting quickly. Mr Johnson said on Monday the government would announce further plans for ""fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences"". The planned changes mean automatic early release from prison will be scrapped for terror offenders, and there will be a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious terror offences. Jonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the government might intend to revive post-9/11 civil powers to detain individuals. That would mean people who were considered to be a risk but had not committed an offence could be detained, he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Overall there were 224 people in prison for terror-related offences in Britain at the end of September. The majority are Islamist extremists (173), and there are also 38 far-right extremists. Currently, most people convicted of terror acts will not serve all of their sentence in jail. For almost all prison sentences (terror-related or not), some of the time will be spent outside jail in order to allow some rehabilitation back into the community. There would be inevitable questions about the operation, said BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. He said: ""Preventing terrorism is all about taking difficult decisions. Which suspects should be watched? What level of risk do they pose and when is the best time to make an arrest, given the need to capture real evidence? ""Those decisions have become harder in recent years as would-be attackers are increasingly likely to act alone and to use low-tech weapons, sometimes on a whim."" This video can not be played Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said armed officers were in ""immediate attendance"" after the attack David Merritt, whose son Jack died in November's London Bridge attack, said that without effective rehabilitation, the government'splans for longer terrorism sentences would only allow prisoners to radicalise each other,externaland ""build greater resentment"". But former military intelligence officer Philip Ingram told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""right and proper"" that the government should assess the laws in place. ""You have to ask the question as to whether some of them may not ever be able to be rehabilitated and, therefore, is the law we have at the moment right and proper to keep the public safe?""

Boris Johnson sets out vision for UK-EU trade deal,"This video can not be played PM: We want a Canada-style deal with the EU Boris Johnson has set out his vision for a trade deal with the EU, saying there is ""no need"" for the UK to follow Brussels' rules. The PM called for a Canada-style free trade deal, saying the UK would return to the Withdrawal Agreement if such a deal was not reached. But the EU's Michel Barnier said its ""ambitious"" trade deal offer required a ""level playing field"". Labour said Mr Johnson's ""ideology had trumped common sense"". The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the PM risked trade and investment in the UK if he kept ""undermining collective agreements"". Under the EU-Canada deal, import tariffs on most goods have been eliminated between the two countries, though there are still customs and VAT checks. The flow of services, such as banking - which is much more important for the UK - between Canada and the EU are much more restricted. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Ports plan for Brexit Irish Sea checks Pound falls on fears of 'bare bones' EU trade deal Barnier: Work should start now on NI agreements Mr Johnson used his speech on ""unleashing Britain's potential"" to raise the prospect of the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms if EU chiefs refuse to sign off on a Canada-style free trade agreement. In his speech in Greenwich, London, the PM said: ""We have often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or an ambitious free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, on the example of Canada. ""We have made our choice - we want a free trade agreement, similar to Canada's but in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. ""The choice is emphatically not 'deal or no deal'. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's - or more like Australia's. In either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper mightily."" Mr Johnson rejected the requirement for the UK to adopt Brussels-made rules ""on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules"". Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab The PM added that he will seek ""a pragmatic agreement on security, protecting our citizens without trespassing on the autonomy of our respective legal systems"". He said the UK was ready to agree a deal on fishing with the EU and suggested that there would be annual negotiations on this. When asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether he accepted that leaving the EU with no comprehensive trade deal could have significant cost for jobs and businesses, Mr Johnson replied: ""We've got a deal, it's a great deal, we're out."" ""When I hear prophecies of doom I've heard them before, I don't believe in them,"" he added. What we saw today was Boris Johnson trying to set the tone for these crucial negotiations. He wants to go into them on the front foot, with a much more direct, assertive, even aggressive if you like, approach than that of Theresa May. And his message was a pretty blunt one; we are not accepting EU rules, we are not accepting the jurisdiction of the European courts, we are pursuing trade deals with other countries, and on fishing - crucial to many EU costal countries - British waters will be first and foremost for British boats. And, if at the end of all that we can't reach any sort of agreement, Britain will still prosper. It seems to me the speech was all about muscle flexing ahead of the negotiations. But be in no doubt, a trade deal with the EU is of huge importance to the British economy, and deals require compromise, whatever the rhetoric. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, offered a contrasting vision to Mr Johnson's. He said the EU was ready to offer a ""highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership"", which included zero tariffs and zero quotas. But, he said, this was dependent on the UK agreeing to ""specific and effective guarantees to ensure a level playing field"" so competition ""is and remains open and fair"". There would also need to be an agreement on fisheries to allow ""continued reciprocal access"", he said. Michel Barnier set out the EU's position in Brussels Mr Barnier said all goods coming into the EU will need to comply with its rules on health or other standards and, as a result, goods entering the union ""will be subject to regulatory checks"". ""Businesses must adapt now for this new reality,"" he said. The more standards the UK and EU had in common, the better the access the EU will be able to offer to its market. ""Will the UK continue to adhere to Europe's societal and regulatory model in the future or will it seek to diverge?"" he said. ""The UK's answer to this question will be fundamental."" The European Commission has published itsdraft negotiating mandate,externaland President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said negotiations would be ""hard and fair and fast"" but that the closer the UK wanted to be to the bloc, the more of its common rules it would have to abide by. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made a statement in the Commons reiterating the prime minister's speech, saying there would be no alignment with the EU or jurisdiction given to its courts. ""Now is the moment to look ahead with confidence and ambition,"" he said. ""Let us show the world that our finest achievement and greatest contributions are ahead."" But Labour's shadow Brexit minister, Paul Blomfield, said many of the issues of the past three years will resurface during the negotiations. ""We will continue to be dogged by the central dilemma that was at the heart of so much of the wrangling over the last three years,"" he told MPs. ""[Will the] new relationship be determined by the economic interests of our country or by the ideological commitments to break with the European social model that drove so many of the Brexit enthusiasts? ""I am sorry to say that today's statement suggestsâ¦ that ideology has trumped common sense."" The SNP's Stewart Hosie also condemned the stance taken by the government, saying its plans ""risk making the UK a smaller, insular and more isolated place"". Labour's Mr Corbyn added: ""Throughout the election campaignâ¦ the prime minister kept assuring us that there was no danger of this country becoming an undercutting islandâ¦ yet at the same time removes the legislative protection that makes sure we don't become an undercutting economic unit. ""The European Union will no doubt be very strong on maintaining alignment and regulations. He has got to come up with an answer."" In 2016, the EU signed a trade agreement with Canada - and this deal could be a template for the UK's future relationship with the EU. The Canada deal gets rid of tariffs (taxes) on the majority of goods traded between the countries - some ""sensitive"" food items, including eggs and chicken, are not covered by it. The EU/Canada agreement means public contracts are opened up to each other's contractors - so Canadian companies can, for example, pitch to build French railways. It also means Canadian products going to the EU have to comply with EU standards (for example on food and product safety) and vice versa. Services - a sector which makes up about 80% of the UK economy - are only partially covered by the deal. Importantly for the UK, this type of agreement does not cover financial services meaning UK-based banks would not be able to serve clients in the EU without licences from individual countries. At the moment, trade between the EU and Australia is based on a limited ""partnership framework"" agreed in 2008, covering co-operation in a wide range of economic areas and agreements on things such as mutual recognition of product standards. Negotiations between the EU and Australia on a fully-fledged free trade agreement began in 2018. Business groups called for more details of the UK's objectives, the Institute of Directors saying the government ""can't just stick to red lines"". And critics hit out at Mr Johnson's suggestion of a deal with the EU ""like Australia's"" with acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calling it ""no deal in all but name"". Sir Ed added: ""Deliberately hollowing out our trade is nothing short of a scorched earth policy for our economy."" In addition to a deal with the EU, the government also wants to make progress in striking free-trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Trade talks between Britain and the EU are due to begin in March and the bloc's own approach to the negotiations needs to be agreed by all 27 member states. While the UK officially left the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, it will remain wedded to EU rules during a transition period which ends in December this year - the PM has said it will not be extended.

Hong Kong hospital strike over virus border fears,"Medical workers hold a strike near Queen Mary Hospital Hundreds of hospital workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike, demanding the border with mainland China be completely closed to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading. Hong Kong has suspended cross-border rail and ferry services, but health workers want a total border closure. Authorities say closing the border completely would go against advice from the World Health Organization. There have been 15 confirmed cases of the virus in the city. Hong Kong to slash border travel as virus spreads Chinese stock markets plunge on coronavirus fears Australia starts Christmas Island virus evacuation ""If there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak,"" Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the newly-formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said. Hundreds of ""non-essential"" medical workers went on strike on Monday. The union said frontline workers - including doctors and nurses - would follow on Tuesday if their demands were not met. Hong Kong - which has a population of seven million - is part of China but retains significant autonomy. The border functions in much the same way as a normal international checkpoint. As well as transportation closures, China has also stopped issuing visas for individual travellers to Hong Kong. There have been more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 361 deaths in mainland China alone. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases of the virus with one death, in the Philippines. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction Various countries have imposed travel restrictions to a varying degree. Denying entry to all foreign visitors who have recently been to China:US, Australia, Singapore Denying entry to foreigners travelling from mainland China:New Zealand, Israel Denying entry to foreigners who have visited Hubei province:Japan, South Korea Other countries have seen their national carriers temporarily suspend all flights to mainland China. These include Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, the UK, and Italy amongst others. Global health officials have advised against the bans. ""Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,"" the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Friday. The WHO recommends introducing screening at  border crossings. It has warned that closing borders could accelerate the spread of the virus, with travellers entering countries unofficially. China has criticised the wave of travel restrictions, accusing foreign governments of ignoring official advice. A new hospital built in just eight days to treat people with the virus began taking patients on Monday. Wuhan's 1,000-bed Huoshenshan Hospital is one of two dedicated facilities built to help tackle the outbreak. A second hospital at Leishenshan is due to be finished on Wednesday. Military medical staff will be running the new hospital Hospitals in the province of Hubei - where Wuhan is located - are reportedly overwhelmed and struggling to treat the growing number of patients. Latest figures from China's National Health Commission on Monday revealed: 21,558 suspected cases of the virus 152,700 people ""under medical watch"" 475 people discharged from hospital The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the similar Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. But the mortality rate of the new virus is much lower, suggesting it is not as deadly. Hospitals in the province are reportedly understaffed and overburdened, as the number of infections rises sharply. According to the Washington Post, some hospital workers have begun wearing nappies because they don't have time to use the bathroom. China to pump billions into economy as coronavirus hits The lessons learned from the Sars outbreak Hospitals are also dealing with a shortage of medical supplies. The Wuhan Children's Hospital posted on social media: ""Medical supplies are in short supply - help!"" Videos on social media showed long queues outside hospitals. In one video, a man with a Wuhan accent at a local hospital said it could take ""as long as 10 hours"" for patients to be seen by a doctor. More than 75,000 people may have been infected in the city of Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak, experts say. But estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than the official figures. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began A report on the early stages of the outbreak by the Lancet medical journal said most patients who died from the virus had pre-existing conditions. The report found that, of the first 99 patients treated at the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, 40 had a weak heart or damaged blood vessels. A further 12 had diabetes. The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms seem to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. But most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a normal flu. An expert at China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that one week was sufficient for a recovery from mild coronavirus symptoms.

Gunmen on bikes kill 20 civilians in Burkina Faso,"As many as 20 civilians have been killed in an overnight attack in north-western Burkina Faso. Unidentified heavily armed men on motorbikes carried out the attack in Lamdamol village in Seno province, north of the capital Ouagadougou, on Saturday night, AFP news agency says. The attack comes a week after 39 people were killed when militants attacked a market in the province of Soum. The Sahel region has seen an increase in jihadist violence in recent months. News of Saturday's attack came as France announced it would send a further 600 soldiers to the Sahel region, bringing the total number of French troops to more than 5,000. Thousands have been displaced by violence in northern Burkina Faso Last year saw the highest death toll due to armed conflict in the region since 2012, with more than 4,000 people killed. Handing out weapons to help villagers fight off jihadists How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Why the Sahara is terror's new front line The country where itâs too dangerous to go to school The security crisis in the Sahel began when an alliance of separatist and Islamist militants took over northern Mali in 2012. France then launched a military intervention against them. Although a peace deal was signed in 2015, it was never fully implemented. New armed groups have since emerged and expanded to central Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, including groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group (IS).

UK donates Â£20m to speed up Coronavirus vaccine,"This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine The government has donated Â£20 million towards a break-neck plan to produce a vaccine to combat the deadly new coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the money would help the UK lead the way indeveloping a new inoculation. It comes as the death toll in China increased to 361 with the total number of cases there now above 17,000. Meanwhile 11 Britons flown back from Wuhan - the outbreak's epicentre - have begun two weeks in quarantine. The additional evacuees -who travelled from China via France- joined 83 people already in group isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The government's Â£20m investment will go to CEPI - the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - a global body aiming to fast-track a vaccine within six to eight months. CEPI chief executive Dr Richard Hatchett said such a tight timescale was ""unprecedented"". How worried should we be about the new coronavirus? China set to open speed-built coronavirus hospital Social media tackles coronavirus fake news If the biologists are successful, more time would still be required to test the vaccine more widely and secure sign-off from medical regulators before it could be distributed across the world. ""This is an extremely ambitious timeline - indeed, it would be unprecedented in the field of vaccine development,"" Dr Hatchett said. ""It is important to remember that even if we are successful - and there can be no guarantee - there will be further challenges to navigate before we can make vaccines more broadly available."" Additional evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan landed in the UK - via France - on Sunday night The UK's money will help fund the efforts of Dr Kate Broderick, a 42-year-old Scot based in California, who is working to create a coronavirus vaccine.

""People go [to the lobby] to collect things and also pick up food and some people will stand having their food together, but all wearing masks,"" she said.

China set to open speed-built coronavirus hospital,"Medical workers hold a strike near Queen Mary Hospital Hundreds of hospital workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike, demanding the border with mainland China be completely closed to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading. Hong Kong has suspended cross-border rail and ferry services, but health workers want a total border closure. Authorities say closing the border completely would go against advice from the World Health Organization. There have been 15 confirmed cases of the virus in the city. Hong Kong to slash border travel as virus spreads Chinese stock markets plunge on coronavirus fears Australia starts Christmas Island virus evacuation ""If there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak,"" Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the newly-formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said. Hundreds of ""non-essential"" medical workers went on strike on Monday. The union said frontline workers - including doctors and nurses - would follow on Tuesday if their demands were not met. Hong Kong - which has a population of seven million - is part of China but retains significant autonomy. The border functions in much the same way as a normal international checkpoint. As well as transportation closures, China has also stopped issuing visas for individual travellers to Hong Kong. There have been more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 361 deaths in mainland China alone. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases of the virus with one death, in the Philippines. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction Various countries have imposed travel restrictions to a varying degree. Denying entry to all foreign visitors who have recently been to China:US, Australia, Singapore Denying entry to foreigners travelling from mainland China:New Zealand, Israel Denying entry to foreigners who have visited Hubei province:Japan, South Korea Other countries have seen their national carriers temporarily suspend all flights to mainland China. These include Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, the UK, and Italy amongst others. Global health officials have advised against the bans. ""Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,"" the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Friday. The WHO recommends introducing screening at  border crossings. It has warned that closing borders could accelerate the spread of the virus, with travellers entering countries unofficially. China has criticised the wave of travel restrictions, accusing foreign governments of ignoring official advice. A new hospital built in just eight days to treat people with the virus began taking patients on Monday. Wuhan's 1,000-bed Huoshenshan Hospital is one of two dedicated facilities built to help tackle the outbreak. A second hospital at Leishenshan is due to be finished on Wednesday. Military medical staff will be running the new hospital Hospitals in the province of Hubei - where Wuhan is located - are reportedly overwhelmed and struggling to treat the growing number of patients. Latest figures from China's National Health Commission on Monday revealed: 21,558 suspected cases of the virus 152,700 people ""under medical watch"" 475 people discharged from hospital The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the similar Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003. But the mortality rate of the new virus is much lower, suggesting it is not as deadly. Hospitals in the province are reportedly understaffed and overburdened, as the number of infections rises sharply. According to the Washington Post, some hospital workers have begun wearing nappies because they don't have time to use the bathroom. China to pump billions into economy as coronavirus hits The lessons learned from the Sars outbreak Hospitals are also dealing with a shortage of medical supplies. The Wuhan Children's Hospital posted on social media: ""Medical supplies are in short supply - help!"" Videos on social media showed long queues outside hospitals. In one video, a man with a Wuhan accent at a local hospital said it could take ""as long as 10 hours"" for patients to be seen by a doctor. More than 75,000 people may have been infected in the city of Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak, experts say. But estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than the official figures. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began A report on the early stages of the outbreak by the Lancet medical journal said most patients who died from the virus had pre-existing conditions. The report found that, of the first 99 patients treated at the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, 40 had a weak heart or damaged blood vessels. A further 12 had diabetes. The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms seem to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. But most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a normal flu. An expert at China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that one week was sufficient for a recovery from mild coronavirus symptoms.

Chinese stocks plunge almost 9% on virus fears,"Fears over the coronavirus triggered a sharp fall in Chinese shares when the market reopened after the Lunar New Year holiday. The Shanghai Composite index closed nearly 8% lower, its biggest daily drop for more than four years. Manufacturing, materials, and consumer goods companies were among the hardest hit, while healthcare shares soared. The fall came despite China's central bank announcing new measures to ease the impact of the outbreak. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly lowered short term interest rates as part of its attempts to relieve pressure on the economy from the rapidly spreading virus. It also pumped an extra 150 billion yuan ($22bn; Â£16.3bn) into the economy on Monday, a move aimed at ensuring there is enough liquidity in the banking system. In total, the central bank will inject 1.2 trillion yuan into the financial system, the majority of which was already planned. The PBOC said it could make more cash available throughout the week, as Chinese financial regulators forecast the impact on the country's already slowing economy will be ""short term"". China pumps billions into economy as coronavirus hits Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food Trump official: Coronavirus could boost US jobs The coronovirus outbreak comes as China's economy, which is the second largest in the world after the US, is slowing, following the trade war between Washington and Beijing. China saw economic growth of 6.1% last year - the weakest expansion in around three decades. A partial trade deal easing tensions was signed earlier this month, but most tariffs remain in place. The falling share prices in China come after global markets were rattled by the epidemic in recent days. Last week, Wall Street's S&P 500 index notched up its worst week since October. China's stock markets are dominated by retail investors - that's non-professional, though often quite wealthy, individuals, as opposed to institutional investors. They own a whopping 80% of A-shares on the Shanghai market, that's shares that are mainly open to Chinese investors. That means they have a profound effect on market movements, and what they're telling us with the sell-off today is that they're scared. But it's also important to remember Chinese investors are playing catch up with falls on markets elsewhere - this is the first time mainland China's stock markets have opened for more than a week, so it is not surprising they've taken a tumble. Still, it's a nuanced picture - and not a case of every company's shares crashing. It is a stock market divided by sectors. So shares in companies that sell healthcare products have actually gone up by some 10% - while companies that are in the manufacturing, real estate and construction sector have fallen sharply. The key question now is how bad the effect of coronavirus will be on China's economy - and as a result, on the fortunes of its companies. The truth is we just don't know. It is difficult to get reliable data from China; typically during the Lunar New Year period it is challenging to gauge how many people are working, or producing things. This year - as one analyst told me - ""economists are flying blind"" because the data coming out of the country is scant, patchy and unreliable at best. Already, many research houses are slashing first quarter growth forecasts for China.  We are essentially in the dark at the moment about the health of China's economy - which is worrying because of how connected it is to the global economy. Analysts say the impact of the virus - which has left major cities in full or partial lockdown - could harm growth if it lasts for a prolonged period. China's travel and tourism sectors have already taken a hit over an unusually quiet Spring Festival break, while cinemas were forced to close to try to contain the virus. Meanwhile, numerous factories have suspended production while companies have instructed employees to work from home. Foxconn, Toyota, Starbucks, McDonald's and Volkswagen are just a few of the corporate giants to have paused operations or shuttered outlets across China. Analysts at Oxford Economics said they expected the economic impact of the coronavirus to be ""high, but short-lived, as during the 2003 Sars episode"". ""However, the scale of the outbreak and impact is set to be worse than in the case of Sars, as the coronavirus is hitting a larger part of China and its population. ""Moreover, we cannot rule out an even more serious and longer-lasting impact due to differences in behaviour of the virus, a larger effect from government travel restrictions and firm closures, and a much more connected economy this time around.""

His career reached an embarrassing end in 1981, when he was jailed for leading a failed coup in the Seychelles. Mr Hoare's son, Chris Hoare, said in a statement that his father died in a care facility in Durban, South Africa. ""Mike Hoare lived by the philosophy that you get more out of life by living dangerously, so it is all the more remarkable that he lived more than 100 years,"" he said. After serving in the British Army during the Second World War and reaching the rank of major, Mr Hoare began his post-war career as an accountant, running several small businesses in South Africa. But it was in 1961 that he was introduced to MoÃ¯se Tshombe - a Congolese politician and businessman who would go on to become prime minister of the Congo three years later. In 1964, Mr Tshombe hired Mr Hoare to take on the communist-backed Simba rebellion. When the campaign was completed 18 months later, Mr Hoare and his unit of mercenaries - which he nicknamed the ""Wild Geese"" - were internationally known. His fervent anti-communist beliefs earned him no fans in many nations, with East German radio regularly describing him as ""that mad bloodhound Hoare"". This led to him being nicknamed ""Mad Mike"" - a moniker with which he was delighted. In 1978, a mercenary adventure film called The Wild Geese was released. The film starred Richard Burton as Colonel Allen Faulkner, a character based heavily on Mr Hoare. Actors Richard Harris, Roger Moore, Richard Burton and Hardy KrÃ¼ger starred in the 1978 film The Wild Geese, based on Mike Hoare's mercenaries But following his successful campaigns in the Congo, what came next turned him into an international laughing stock. Mr Hoare appeared to be retired from military life by the start of the 1980s - but in 1981 he launched a surprise attempt at overthrowing the government of the Seychelles. It is believed that Mr Hoare knew the Seychelles well, and had a particular hatred of its socialist government under President Albert RenÃ©. Having gained the tacit support of the governments of South Africa and Kenya, Mr Hoare began to plot. In October 1981 he had a cache of weapons delivered to his suburban bungalow in South Africa, which he hid in his cellar. He recruited 46 men, and with them he planned to enter the Seychelles disguised as a charitable drinking club of former rugby players. Almost all of the men managed to get through customs at Mahe airport. However, one of their group joined the wrong queue, got into an argument with a customs officer, and ended up having his bag searched. When officers found a dismantled AK-47, the man panicked and revealed that there were more weapons outside. At this point the entire plan unravelled, and amid the ensuing conflict at the airport the mercenaries commandeered an Air India plane and flew it back to South Africa. When they arrived the mercenaries were jailed for six days, and Mr Hoare and his plans - dubbed ""the package-holiday coup"" - were ridiculed in the global press. A year later they were tried for hijacking the Air India plane. Mr Hoare was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years suspended. He was released after 33 months. Mr Hoare spent his final years in South Africa, and published several memoirs - including Mercenary, The Road to Kalamata, and The Seychelles Affair.
