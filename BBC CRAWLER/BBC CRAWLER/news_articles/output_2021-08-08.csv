Quarantine-free travel from France to UK resumes,"Visitors to Paris no longer have to quarantine on their return, after UK fears over the Beta variant faded Fully vaccinated people can now visit France without quarantining on their return to the UK, after travel rule changes came into force at 04:00 BST. Brittany Ferries said it had received a ""surge"" of bookings following the rule changes announced on Thursday. But travel agents said the relaxation of quarantine for one of the UK's most popular destinations came ""too late to save the summer"". Meanwhile, travellers in Mexico had to rush back to avoid hotel quarantine. Under the latest changes to the UK's traffic light system for travel, the rules have been relaxed for a dozen countries. France moved from its own amber-plus category on to the amber list, which means children and fully vaccinated passengers do not have to quarantine on their return, although unvaccinated travellers still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days. It comes as the UK recorded 27,429 new Covid cases on Sunday, as well as 39 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Sunday's data means that after a consistent fall since mid-July, the weekly total of cases has shown a slight increase over the previous seven days, of 1.9%. Which countries are now on the green list? Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean Why was France put on the amber-plus list? International cruises from England to restart Among those to benefit from the rule changes is Emma Wood, who lives in Laon, France. Her parents, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, are planning to visit France next week to meet Emma's six-month-old daughter for the first time. ""We're so pleased but we daren't get our hopes up until they're here,"" she said. ""They were going to come before but then they introduced the new amber-plus list."" She said she usually saw her parents five or six times a year but had not seen them in more than 12 months. ""My mum has been desperate to see her granddaughter,"" she added. Emma Wood can't wait for her parents to meet their new granddaughter Londoner Kyle Frank has also booked a trip after the change was announced. He plans to drive to Nice because he feels it is safer than taking a plane - and so he can bring his puppy, Indy, with him. ""It would have been great to book it before but everything has been changing so rapidly it's hard to understand when it will be safe to travel. So I'm trying to go now while I can,"" he told the BBC. ""There's no quarantine when I get back to London so I can get straight back to work."" Kyle Frank says he plans to drive to France, so he can travel with his puppy, Indy Moved from amber to green:Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway Moved from amber-plus to amber:France Moved from red to amber:India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE Moved from amber to red:Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, said the company had seen bookings surge after it was announced travel rules for France were being relaxed. But the company still only expects to carry a quarter of its usual number of passengers. ""Let's be realistic, we would need tens of thousands of people booking to make up for the poor season,"" Mr Mathieu said. ""It's more than welcome this announcement, it's good news, but it comes in a year when at the end of the day for us everything is about 2022 and making that a real, normal year."" The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England - althoughWales criticised the UK governmentfor not consulting them. There are now 36 countries onthe green list,external- from which even unvaccinated travellers do not have to quarantine - following the addition of seven more nations, including Germany, Austria and Norway. And India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been moved from the red list to the amber list. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit. But one travel agent said the latest changes had only made a small difference and testing requirements were still putting many Britons off booking foreign trips. ""It's far too late to save the summer,"" said Julia Lo Bue-Said, from the Advantage Travel Partnership. She said a lot of people had already made their holiday plans and the increase in bookings had been ""marginal"". ""When you think that most businesses are 80% down, you need a huge volume to make up the shortfall they're experiencing,"" she said. Four destinations are also subject to tighter restrictions. Mexico, Georgia, and the French overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, have been added the red list. Only British citizens, Irish citizens, and UK residents can travel from red list countries and they must stay for 10 days in hotel quarantine at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult - which increases to Â£2,285 from 12 August. Lotis Bautista, one of thousands of Britons on holiday in Mexico when the announcement was made, paid hundreds of pounds to cut short her trip by a week and rush back home before Sunday's deadline. She said she and her husband could not have afforded the costs of hotel quarantine. ""I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't incredibly upset when it happened. Even though you know there are risks, you hope there might be a more responsible way of doing things from the government,"" Ms Bautista said. ""We're eighteen months into he pandemic and we're still being being given two, three days' notice."" TOKYO OLYMPICS:Can Shauna Coxsey help Radio 1's Jordan North overcome his fear of heights?

When Kim Si-woo hit five straight shots into the water on the 11th at the WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational, he would certainly have been asking the question. And it's not one he is going to be allowed to forget anytime soon, as his score of 13 goes down as the highest on a par three on the PGA Tour - outside of the four majors - since 1983. It saw him slip from five over par to 15 over and tumble to the back of the field in one horror 155-yard hole. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His disastrous bid to find terra firma saw Kim send his tee shot right of the island green. The South Korean, who has won three PGA Tour events, then went to a drop zone 96 yards from the hole. From there, it became a recurring golfing nightmare as he plonked his next four shots into the water before finally finding the rough with his 11th shot. Kim then chipped to within a foot of the cup before tapping in for an unenviable 13. And how does one respond to such a showing? Well, it was a mixed bag from Kim who last week finished in a share of 32nd in the men's golf competition at the Tokyo Olympics. He birdied the next hole, then had more trouble on the par-three 14th where he sent another tee shot into the water and double-bogeyed before following up with three birdies. While it was a significant recovery, it was not enough to avoid finishing last in the field of 65 that completed all four rounds at TPC Southwind in Memphis. Kim finished 30 shots adrift of the trio of Abraham Ancer, Sam Burns and Hideki Matsuyama who finished 16 under par to go to a three-way play-off. Ancer eventually prevailed on the second play-off hole with a birdie to clinch his first Tour victory and become just the fourth Mexico-born player to win a title. The 30-year-old had started the day four strokes adrift of overnight leader Harris English, but produced a solid final round 68 to find his way into the play-off. English looked to be closing in on a wire-to-wire victory going onto the final nine holes of the event, but doubles bogeys on the 11th and 14th and a bogey on the 16th saw him fall one stroke short of the play-off trio.

Team GB match London 2012 medal haul,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Jason Kenny wins the men's keirin to claim his seventh Olympic gold Team GB have matched their medal total from London 2012 on the final day of the Tokyo Games. Track cyclist Jason Kenny'shistoric goldmoved GB up to 64 medals on Sunday, hours before boxerLauren Price won goldin the middleweight final. That puts Britain on 65 medals - equalling their performance as hosts nine years ago and making Tokyo their second-most successful overseas Olympics after Rio 2016. They claimed 22 golds, 21 silvers and 22 bronze medals in Japan. Britain won 67 medals at the Rio Games - finishing second in the medal table - and UK Sport had set a medal target range of between45 and 70 medalsfor these delayed Olympics. GB's most successful female athlete, Laura Kenny, was chosen to carry the British flag inSunday's closing ceremony. Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: ""At Rio 2016, Great Britain became the first country to improve on its medal tally in the Olympics after being the host - and Team GB have now become the first to equal or win more medals at each of the next two Games."" Jason Kenny wins stunning seventh gold Lauren Price win's women's middleweight boxing gold Tokyo Olympics full medal table How will Tokyo Olympics be remembered? Ten heartwarming Tokyo 2020 moments How closely have you been paying attention to Tokyo 2020? The Team GB performance in Tokyo has exceeded pre-Gamespredictionsof 52 medals and 14 golds - despite high-profile setbacks including a shock first-round taekwondo defeat forJade Jones, injury issues forDina Asher-Smith,Adam GemiliandKatarina Johnson-Thompson, and the withdrawal of potential gold medal shooterAmber Hillwith Covid-19 before the Games started. Team GB's medal aspirations were revised down by the governing body to take account of the ""extraordinary circumstances"" presented to athletes and staff in the build-up to the Games. UK Sport said success would also be measured in a ""broader and more holistic"" way than just medals. Team GB have finished Tokyo 2020 in their lowest position on the medal table since the 2008 Games in Beijing despite matching their London 2012 total Team GB finish Tokyo 2020 fourth in the medal table behind the USA, China and Japan - their lowest position since Beijing 2008. Team GB chef de mission Mark England hailed the medal haul in Tokyo as ""the greatest achievement in British Olympic history"". He said: ""Not only has the team made history but it has probably made history on the back of the most complex and most challenging and difficult environment that we will face certainly in my lifetime. ""It has been against all the odds and I think it is the greatest achievement in British Olympic history. It has been the miracle of Tokyo."" England believes the team is in great shape before the 2024 Games in Paris. ""The Bryony Pages of this team, winning another bronze after her silver medal in Rio, and the women's artistic gymnastics team winning a bronze with two 16-year-old twins - these kept the scoreboard ticking over and gave everybody the confidence that the team is in great shape,"" he said. ""We've had 16 fourth places. This is a very, very young team and a very talented team, and a team I'm absolutely confident that will go to Paris in less than three years and do exceptionally well."" Six-time Olympic cycling gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy told BBC Sport that the British team ""should be incredibly proud"" of their achievements in Tokyo. He added: ""Expectations were mixed going into it. Certain sports didn't perform as expected, others overachieved. ""You get payment in kind for a gold. We have a limited pot of money and you have to use that as best you can. It's about intelligent use of money, thinking outside the box and being inventive. ""They have done us all proud - a great performance."" Team GB won medals in 25 sports in Tokyo - more than any other country. We've grouped some sports together for this chart This video can not be played Jason Kenny reacts to winning seventh Olympic gold with victory in keirin Jason Kenny successfully defended his keirin title to become the first Briton to win seven Olympic gold medals. Great Britain's most decorated athlete stunned the men's keirin field as he sprinted clear with three laps remaining to claim victory and his ninth Olympic medal overall. After winning gold, the 33-year-old said he had ""all but given up"" before Sunday's final, but with October's World Track Cycling Championships around the corner and the next Olympics in Paris only three years away, he admitted he might have bought himself more time. Jason Kenny's tally of seven golds is one more than former team-mate Chris Hoy Jason's wife Laura finished sixth in her bid for a third successive omnium title. The five-time Olympic gold medallist said she felt""really tired"",externalafterwinning gold alongside Katie Archibaldin the madison on Friday. The 29-year-old arrived at the fourth and final event - the points race - down in ninth position and 38 points adrift of top place after a crash in the scratch race but fought back to finish sixth overall.

Hundreds more evacuated as Greek wildfires rage,"This video can not be played Watch as the coastguard moves hundreds of people to safety Hundreds more people have been forced to flee their homes in Greece as firefighters struggle to contain huge, days-old, wildfires. Tourists and locals were evacuated by boat from Evia, the country's second-largest island, on Sunday. More than 2,000 people have now been evacuated in total. Houses and power lines have also been destroyed. While the fire on Evia is the most severe, dozens of smaller blazes are burning around the country. The fires broke out after the most severe heatwave in 30 years, in which temperatures spiked to 45C (113F). Heatwaves such as this are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The subsequent hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires. Firefighting aircraft dropped water onto the blazes on Sunday ""We have ahead of us another difficult evening, another difficult night,"" Civil Protection Deputy Minister Nikos Hardalias said on Sunday. ""On Evia we have two major fire fronts, one in the north and one in the south,"" he said, adding that the situation around the capital Athens had improved. ""We are afraid of the danger of flare-ups,"" Mr Hardalias warned. Hundreds of firefighters have been deployed to Evia, and a total of 17 planes and helicopters are being used. The army has also been sent in. Dramatic footage showed ferries full of people surrounded by the burning landscape and bright red skies. ""I feel angry. I lost my home... nothing will be the same,"" one resident, Vasilikia, told Reuters news agency as she boarded a rescue ferry on Sunday. ""It's a disaster. It's huge. Our villages are destroyed, there is nothing left from our homes,"" she added. ANALYSIS:The burning issue of wildfires EXPLAINER:How do you fight extreme wildfires? Authorities say the risk of further fires remains high in many regions, including Athens and Crete. Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has warned the country could face a ""nightmarish summer"" of continuous forest fires. In the last 10 days, more than 56,000 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. On Saturday, a fire just north of Athens on Mount Parnitha spread smoke across the capital. Authorities set up a hotline for people with breathing difficulties, according to the Associated Press. Thousands of people were evacuated from the area but the flames have receded. However, with strong winds forecast, there are concerns that the fire could flare again. A number of countries have offered support to Greece. The UK, France, Romania and Switzerland have sent firefighters to the country. By Bethany Bell, BBC News, Evia There are long queues of cars at the port in Evia, waiting to get on ferries to the mainland. Holidaymakers and some locals are leaving, to get to a place of safety, away from the heavy cloud of smoke and ash that hangs in the air. One woman said she was hopeful that her holiday home would be safe, but others were angry with the authorities. They have abandoned us, one man said. ""They know wildfires can happen, but they've made no preparations, people are having to put out the flames by themselves,"" he said. Are you in the area? Have you been affected by the fires?

Tobacco giant raises bid for respiratory drugmaker,"Philip Morris sells more than a tenth of cigarettes worldwide Tobacco giant Philip Morris has raised its bid to buy respiratory drugmaker Vectura to more than Â£1bn. Vectura makes inhaled medicines and devices to treat respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and counts Novartis and GSK among its customers. The Marlboro cigarette maker increased its offer to Â£1.65 ($2.29) per share after US private equity firm Carlyle offered Â£958m ($1.3bn) on Friday. Vectura has not yet responded to requests for comment on the new bid. It previously said it was backing Carlyle's offer and withdrawing its recommendation for Philip Morris' earlier bid. The London-listed company said on Friday that it believed it could better positioned under Carlyle's ownership, noting the ""reported uncertainties relating to the impact on Vectura's wider stakeholders arising as a result of the possibility of the company being owned by PMI (Philip Morris)"". Vectura has also agreed to develop a potential inhaled treatment for Covid-19 with Inspira, a UK-based pharmaceuticals company which focuses on developing therapies for respiratory and infectious diseases. Vectura previously backed a deal from a US private equity firm In a statement, Philip Morris said: ""The PMI (Philip Morris International) increased offer values the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Vectura at approximately Â£1.02bn ($1.41bn)."" ""PMI intends to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit that will form the backbone of its inhaled therapeutics business,"" the tobacco company added. The latest offer represents a premium of 10p per share to the rival offer of Â£1.55 a share by Carlyle Group. The fresh bid comes after Philip Morris saidit could stop selling cigarettes in the UK in 10 years' timeas it focuses on alternatives, such as heated tobacco. The firm indicated it would welcome a government ban on cigarettes and said ""strong regulation"" was needed to ""help solve the problem of cigarette smoking once and for all"".

"Afghanistan withdrawal a mistake, warns ex-general","Withdrawing troops from Afghanistan is a strategic mistake that risks a resurgence of terrorism, a former top UK general has said. Gen Sir Richard Barrons, who was head of UK Joint Forces Command, told the BBC the UK and Western allies have ""sold the future of Afghanistan"". Most British troops left last month and the Taliban have captured five cities in three days. A senior Tory backbencher called it a ""shabby withdrawal"". Fighting in Afghanistan intensified in recent weeks after President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of US forces, followed by allies such as the UK. Two decades after they were removed from power by the US over their support for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of the 11 September attacks, Taliban militants are advancing across the country and haveseized five regional capitalssince Friday. Gen Barrons told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""The withdrawal now is a strategic mistake. I don't believe it's in our own interest."" Who are the Taliban? UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - general Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PM He said the decision had ""sold the future of Afghanistan into a very difficult place"" and sent a ""really unfortunate message"" to allies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It suggests ""we don't have the stomach to see these things through, and we would rather leave than ensure that a humanitarian or political crisis doesn't occur"", Gen Barrons said. ""We will run the risk of terrorist entities re-establishing in Afghanistan, to bring harm in Europe and elsewhere,"" he said. ""I think this is a very poor strategic outcome."" The UK government advised all British citizens to leave this week because of the worsening security situation. But Gen Barrons said an exodus of the international community ""as fair weather friends"", followed by the Afghan elite, could undermine the government and its military, accelerating the crisis. He said he feared the country could split in two or be plunged into a decades-long civil war unless political discussions could resume. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the House of Commons Defence Committee, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the UK was making a ""shabby withdrawal"" and ""abandoning the country to the very insurgency that drew us there in the first place"". ""Unless we wake up to the reality of what is taking place, Afghanistan might once again become a terror state. This, remember, is the country that brought us 9/11,"" he said. The UK and its allies should retain an assistance force of 5,000 troops to give ground, air and intelligence support to the Afghan army in their fight against the Taliban, Mr Ellwood said. By withdrawing, the UK was also giving up a ""strategically crucial space to an expansionist China"", he said. But Gen Barrons suggested China would be key to any political resolution, because of its influence on Pakistan - which was one of the few countries to recognise the Taliban when it last held power. He said because China shared a border with Afghanistan it would want to avoid any instability that could mean refugees - or militants - flowing over the border. A UK Government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that the security situation in Afghanistan is serious, and reports of the escalating violence are extremely disturbing. ""We do not believe there is any military solution to Afghanistan's conflict, and call on the Taliban to end their campaign of violence and engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government. ""There needs to be a negotiated solution to ensure a lasting peace."" TOKYO OLYMPICS:Can Shauna Coxsey help Radio 1's Jordan North overcome his fear of heights?

Javid urges review of excessive Covid test costs,"The health secretary has asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. In a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority, Sajid Javid said it was time for a ""rapid high-level"" review to protect consumers. Holidaymakers have complained of huge prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus firms offering PCR tests. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average but prices can reach hundreds. Mr Javid wrote in his letter to CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli: ""I know that for too many people the cost of PCR testing can act as a barrier, especially for families who want to travel together. ""We have all experienced enormous disruption to our lives over this pandemic but it is not right if some families experience yet further disruption unnecessarily because of potentially unfair practices in the market for private travel tests."" Rather than wait for a long competition investigation, Mr Javid has requested immediate advice from the CMA on how to ""stamp out any exploitative behaviour in this market"". The government publishes a list of companies and clinics offering testing but there have been reports that many have not got full accreditation. There are reports of PCR tests being offered for as little as Â£20, and more than Â£500. In addition to complaints about high charges, consumers have also reported not receiving test results or of being sent damaged PCR kits. Avi Lasarow, chief executive of Covid testing company Prenetics, said the decision to investigate excessive pricing was ""long overdue"". ""Companies on the government list must be responsible in their pricing strategies,"" he said. ""The list has been exploited by some testing providers luring in consumers with misleading prices and then offering tests that are up to nine times more expensive."" Mr Lasarow said the ""easiest way"" to make tests cheaper would be for the government to axe VAT on holiday Covid tests. ""If VAT was removed, a family of four flying from London to Majorca could save Â£166 - which would pay for the cost of the flights,"" he said. A spokesperson for the CMA said that as formal investigations can take a long time, in this instance it will provide advice to Mr Javid with a view to taking swift action. ""We are aware of concerns about the evolving markets for Covid-19 tests for international travellers. We look forward to providing the Secretary of State with advice on how best to ensure that travellers have access to tests that are affordable and reliable,"" the CMA said. The government has been under pressure from the travel industry and its own MPs to ditch the costly PCR tests. Willie Walsh, former boss of British Airways and now director general of the International Air Travel Association, has accused PCR firms of ""profiteering"". And last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, tweeted: ""Passengers are being ripped off with expensive PCR tests.""

"Anger after Zimbabwe bride, 14, dies giving birth","The UN has condemned the practice of child marriage Police in Zimbabwe are investigating the death of a 14-year-old girl during childbirth, a case that sparked outrage among citizens and rights activists. Memory Machaya is reported to have died last month at a church shrine in the eastern region of Marange. The case has exposed the exploitation of minors, as she was reportedly forced to abandon school to get married. The United Nations urged the government to recognise child marriage as a crime and bring an end to the practice. The organisation said it ""notes with deep concern"" and ""condemns strongly"" reports into the circumstances surrounding the death. ""The current trend of unresolved cases of violence against women and girls in Zimbabwe, including marriages of minors, cannot continue with impunity,"" the UN said in a statement on Saturday. The girl's death on 15 July has put the spotlight on the practice of child marriage within Zimbabwe's Apostolic Church, which often rejects medicine and hospital treatment. Her family has said that the baby survived the birth and was doing well, local media report. The circumstances that led to the death and subsequent burial are under investigation by the police and the country's state gender commission. An online petition calling for ""justice for Memory Machaya"" has so far received more than 57,000 signatures. Zimbabwean feminist activist Everjoice Win said it wastime for people to pressure those ""with the power to uphold the law, or make new laws"",external. Women and girls were ""not seen as fully human, with individual rights... to control our own bodies"" she wrote on Twitter. By law, Zimbabwean girls are allowed to get married at the age of 18, while 16 is the age of sexual consent. But some families believe child marriage can provide financial benefits. Many child brides hope marriage will provide the opportunity to go to school. However, young girls typically end up falling pregnant soon after, or being kept at home to carry out household chores.

Time nearly up to stop climate catastrophe - Sharma,"Former Business Secretary Alok Sharma is now leading COP26, the climate summit in Glasgow in November The world is ""dangerously close"" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said. Mr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves. ""We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,""he told the Observer.,external But he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects. And he defended his decision to travel tomore than 30 countries in seven months. Mr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead ofa major report being released on Mondayfrom the United Nations' climate change researchers. The report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades. The summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November. Doug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said ""world leaders have done a terrible job of listening"" to warnings about climate change. ""This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now."" Wildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fireshave also been burning in Turkeyand California in the US. This summer,western Europe also sawits worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people. What is COP26 and what needs to be agreed? A really simple guide to climate change Mr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be ""catastrophic"". ""I don't think there's any other word for it,"" he said. ""You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record."" This video can not be played What is climate change? He added: ""We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world."" Mr Sharma said the report released on Monday is ""going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming"". ""I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time."" ""Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,"" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the ""changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat"" endured by the continent in recent years. He added: ""The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable."" Glasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. The summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. But campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. Earlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. Mr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: ""Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation. ""There will be a climate check on any licences."" This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Mr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months. However, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change. Mr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were ""incredibly vital and actually impactful"". ""It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,"" he said. It also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that,externalForeign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine. A government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return.

Swimmers warned over river sewage and pollution,"Waterways have become increasingly popular places to swim, especially with pools closed in lockdown Swimmers planning a dip in Wales' rivers have been warned to be wary of sewage and pollution before diving in. Waterways have become increasingly popular places to swim, especially with pools being closed during lockdown. DÅµr Cymru's own figures revealed that in 2020, raw sewage was dumped in Wales' rivers more than 100,000 times for almost 900,000 hours. The Welsh government said it had spent millions of pounds on Wales' waters and 46% of rivers were ""at good status"". But wild swimmer Angela Jones said her favourite waterway, the River Wye, was ""dying"" because of sewage and farm pollution. Dubbed the ""Wild Woman of the Wye"", Ms Jones said she had been monitoring the state of its waters and, in her 35 years on the river, she had never seen it in such a state, with sections where she would not swim any longer. Why wild swimming is Britain's new craze Water firm fined Â£90m for deliberate sewage spills Pollution causing river âdeath by a thousand cutsâ ""It's just disrespect from water companies and farmers treating it like an open sewer,"" the 55-year-old said. In April, DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water said 100,000 discharges happenedacross more than 2,000 water treatment works and sewer overflowsacross the Welsh network in 2020. And over the years DÅµr Cymru has been fined hundreds of thousands of pounds forkilling fish,spilling chemicalsas well as dumping sewage. Ms Jones, who sometimes spends as much as 40 hours a week in the Wye, reports the problems she sees. Angela Jones monitors the quality of the water flowing along the River Wye ""It's companies, it's people, it's businesses who just think it's an easy way to get rid of sewage, wash-off from poultry farms, everything,"" she said. ""I desperately want to protect the river and feel like I am letting it down."" She called for greater accountability, changes to the law and greater fines for those found to have polluted. In December, a report by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) foundmore than half of the River Wye was failing to meet pollution targets. Concerns have been raised about the effects of phosphates from chicken farmson pollution levels in the Wye. But, while NRW said poultry farms in Powys were having an impact, it said the reasons behind the pollution were more complex and sources were varied. Ms Jones recently highlighted the state of the Wye by swimming a kilometre (0.6 miles) along the river in Monmouth while towing a coffin bearing the words ""Death of the Wye"", alongside paddle boarders dressed as grim reapers. This video can not be played Wild swimmer Angela Jones says she hopes her specially designed coffin will catch attention ""When you see the amount of sewage that is dumped, it is diabolical,"" said Angela, who lives in Monmouthshire. ""There is no way I am going to give up on this river."" In April, the BBC's Panorama highlighted DÅµr Cymru as one of the worst offenders among UK water companiesfor dumping untreated sewage. Environmentalist George Monbiot highlighted algae which has flourished in rivers like the Wye. According to the Natural Environment Research Council, this is caused by excess phosphorus from sewage, and run-off from fields fertilised with phosphorus compounds. It also leads to a reduction of oxygen in water. BBC Wales - BBC Wales - The Merthyr Mermaid New pollution rules 'compel farmers to change' Natural resources used at 'unsustainable rate' Mr Monbiot drew attention to damage wrought on rivers by farming as chemicals and nitrates from the dung of cattle, pigs and chickens ran into them. He added: ""We are seeing a comprehensive ecological collapse going on in Wales' rivers."" The Welsh government has designated the whole of Wales a ""nitrate vulnerable zone"" (NVZ) and introduced stricter rules on the storage and spread of slurry, in a bid to tackle river pollution. But a farming union ischallenging Wales' pollution rules in the High Court. Afonydd Cymru, which represents river trusts, said sewer overflows needed to be addressed, but warned replacing the existing system would take decades and cost billions of pounds. It said agricultural pollution had worsened as livestock farming intensified. Chairman Chris Mills said: ""Waste products being produced from this farming are simply too great for the land to cope with, coupled with inadequate storage capacity, inappropriate spreading, and poor land use management."" Environmentalist George Monbiot says Wales' rivers were facing a ""comprehensive ecological collapse"" Monmouth MP David Davies is calling on the Welsh government to follow the UK government and bring in new legislation to tackle river pollution. The UK government says its Environment Bill would include new legal duties to tackle sewage discharges into rivers. Mr Davies, a wild swimmer himself, said: ""It is absolutely vital we protect our waterways"". NFU Cymru said it was concerned about ""false claims"" made about poultry farming. Wales a haven for wildlife - but for how long? Battle to save 'slimy' as well as 'cute' creatures Welsh rivers farm pollution 'embarrassing' A spokeswoman said: ""Despite claims from some campaigners regarding the impact of poultry farming within the Wye catchment, a recent NRW report is clear that the overall pattern of failures in the Wye does not support the hypothesis that poultry units are the main, or even a particularly important reason, for nutrient failures within the catchment."" The Welsh government said it had provided Â£9.5m during this financial year to improve water quality in Wales, and that 42% of Wales' water bodies and 46% of rivers were at ""good status"". But, it added: ""Pressures from the past, such as legacy chemicals, will affect the water environment for decades to come."" Natural Resources Wales' Ceri Davies said it had a range of projects to improve the health of Wales' rivers, citing its Â£6.8m ""Dee life"" scheme. ""We have prosecuted water companies three times over the past six years, whilst five prosecutions have been related to agricultural pollution,"" she said. NRW's Ceri Davies says the government body has prosecuted water companies three times in the past six years DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water said it had invested more than Â£85m in the past decade on removing phosphorus from rivers, including at 10 locations on the Wye, where it said it had been responsible for ""less than a third"" of phosphorus. ""We are committed to working collaboratively with all bodies involved and to play our part in helping to further enhance river water quality,"" a spokesman added.

Lauren Price: The girl who reached for the moon,"This video can not be played GB's Lauren Price beats China's Li Qian to win gold in the women's middleweight boxing In the early 2000s, an eight-year-old was asked to write down three goals as part of a school project. She wrote that she wanted to become a kickboxing world champion, play international football for Wales and go to the Olympic Games. Her teacher raised an eyebrow, but the girl's grandmother told her to let the girl dream. She had always told her granddaughter to reach for the moon and that if she fell short, she would land on the stars. By the time she was 27, the girl had achieved all three of her goals. And then she went even further. Not only did she go to the Olympics, butthe middleweight won a gold medal. This is the story of Lauren Price: Olympic boxing champion. Price was only three days old when it was decided her parents would not be able to look after her. Her nan, Linda, and granddad, Derek, took her in and raised her. Their terraced house in the south Wales town of Ystrad Mynach became Price's home too. They used to call her Tigger. This video can not be played 'Without my grandparents I'd have been put in care' - Welsh boxer Lauren Price The young Price had so much energy that her sporting journey began as a means of helping her burn off some steam. ""She was an adorable child - always smiling, always happy,"" Linda recalls. ""But always very, very busy - into everything. ""When she was very young, she was obsessed with football and running around. On a wet day she'd get a football and she'd be kicking it up and down the stairs. ""I knew we had to do something because she was continually on the go."" They tried athletics first. Derek took seven-year-old Lauren to a local club in Bargoed, but they were told she was too young. So the former football coach contacted an old friend, who was setting up a football club in nearby Fleur-de-Lys. Price became their first, and only, girl member. She loved the physical side of sport and it was not long before she took up kickboxing too. Rob Taylor had a club called Devils Martial Arts - the club that also shaped the early years of Great Britain taekwondo starLauren Williams, who took silver in Tokyo- and coached groups of children in the local leisure centre. ""I'll always remember her coming through the door,"" Rob smiles. ""Little girl, bright blonde hair. ""She just had such an appetite for working. She always wanted to hit the pads. ""She was training seven, eight, nine, 10 hours a week. Three, four nights a week. Her gran and granddad would bring her along. She's back again, back again. ""We'd tried a competition and she'd do well in that. Then we'd move on and on. ""Her appetite and work-rate was insatiable. It was just infectious."" Lauren Price won four kickboxing world titles as a teenager before taking up boxing. By the time Lauren was 13, she was fighting adults - and beating them. She won four senior world kickboxing titles, as well as a host of European golds. At every training session and competition, at home or abroad, her grandparents would be there. ""If it wasn't for my nan and granddad supporting me, I wouldn't have achieved anything,"" Price has said. ""They paid thousands for me to travel abroad and for me to compete, training every night, driving around the country."" Linda says there was never a question. Welcoming the young Price into their home had given her and Derek a new lease of life. Nearly every day of the week they would take her to training - kickboxing on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Football training twice a week, then a match on Saturday and another on Sunday. ""I just knew she was going to succeed,"" Linda says. ""She was one of these kids who got it into her head she was going to achieve and she just did. ""With her kickboxing, sometimes she'd train four hours a night. That's an awful lot of hours to be training when you're only nine or 10. ""She never once said, 'I don't want to go to training tonight'. Whether it was football or kickboxing. Never once. You just knew she was going to do something good."" Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Even as the kickboxing titles racked up, Price continued to play football. After the age of 14, girls were no longer allowed to play in boys' teams. So she moved to Georgetown Girls in Merthyr Tydfil - before Cardiff City Women came calling. ""I don't think I'll ever coach another player as good as Lauren, with her ability but also her discipline,"" former coach Lesley-Ann Judd says. ""That's what I liked about Lauren. Her discipline to always improve. ""In training she'd be there early. Sometimes before I'd even set the cones up. And she'd be there right until the end. ""If she needed to work on something, she'd work on it. She listened and everything was just perfected."" Price's nan always encouraged her. When she wrote out those three goals at school, Linda warned her teacher not to shatter her dreams. ""I've always said 'reach for the moon and if you fall short, you'll land on the stars',"" she says. ""Something will come. Just be determined and persevere. Always believe in yourself."" Price gave up playing football for Wales to concentrate on her boxing career Price's footballing ability soon turned heads. She represented Wales at under-16, under-17, under-19 and senior level - all before her 17th birthday. She went on to play for her country 52 times across all age groups and captained Wales Under-19s, winning two senior caps in 2012-13. Those kickboxing world titles and international football caps meant that two of the three goals that eight-year-old Lauren had written out had been achieved. But the challenge to become an Olympian remained. ""I'd always watched the Olympics from a young age,"" Price said. ""I remember seeing Kelly Holmes [at Athens 2004] and people like that. ""It's the biggest sporting event ever. It just gave me goosebumps. I just wanted to compete in it one day. I didn't know in one sport or how."" Her kickboxing and football careers continued, but Price had also gone for a trial at GB Taekwondo - and been successful. She left home at 16 and moved to Manchester. She lived with future double Olympic champion Jade Jones, who had also recently joined the programme. The London Olympics were round the corner but the sport was not quite right for Price. ""It didn't really fit with me,"" she admitted. ""It was hard being away from home at that age. ""In kickboxing I was always better with my hands than my legs. So I decided to come back and went to a boxing gym."" It proved to be a life-changing decision. This was not Price's first time in a boxing gym. She had done a bit to improve her upper-body strength as she thought it would help her improve as a defender in football. But it was the first time she started to take it seriously. As ever, her granddad would willingly take her to train. Unsurprisingly, her kickboxing background and physical fitness meant she hit the ground running. It was not long before she was sent to the Wales boxing squad for an assessment. She impressed and at 17 years old was selected for the Youth World Championships. Price reached the final and looked on course to win, only for the fight to be stopped because she got a nosebleed. She still seems aggrieved to this day. She continued to box for Wales and play football for her country. In football, she captained Wales Under-19s at a home European Championship. In boxing, she was given an opportunity that would change the course of her sporting career for good. Women's boxing had just been added to the Commonwealth Games programme. In 2014 she was given the chance to box for Team Wales. The time had come to throw her weight behind one sport and having watched Nicola Adams and Katie Taylor win gold at London 2012, Price had the Olympic Games in her sights once again. She went to the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and won bronze in the women's middleweight competition. Even now, she believes she was unlucky in the semi-final. Price joined the GB Boxing programme after the Rio 2016 Olympics. Price continued to train and continued to compete, but the Welsh programme was not full-time. So she became a taxi driver at the weekend, delivering passengers back home through the night. It all helped make ends meet. Then, after the 2016 Olympics, she got a chance to trial for the British programme in Sheffield - which had brought back eight Olympic medals at the last two Games alone. ""Your initial thoughts are 'is she just awkward or is she good?',"" says GB Boxing performance director Rob McCracken. ""That's your first thought because it's early days. Then you quickly realise she was really good. Loads of potential. ""She had a really good platform with Wales. They brought her through on to GB and she's just got better and bigger and smarter and stronger - and technically [she is] really sound. ""Her achievements have been phenomenal. She's just been absolutely brilliant."" Within 18 months of moving on to the full-time GB programme, Price won Commonwealth gold in 2018. The following year she won European Games gold in the summer, before securing her first world title that autumn. When 2020 - an Olympic year - came around, Price was the reigning world, European and Commonwealth champion and world number one. It seemed her third big target was finally about to be hit. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Lauren Price stages 'terrific' comeback to book place in middleweight final But then Covid-19 hit. Boxing's Olympic qualifying event in London was the perfect example of how quickly the world as we knew it unravelled. It began at the Copper Box Arena on Saturday, moved behind closed doors on Sunday and was suspended by the Monday. Price had been due to fight for her Olympic spot on Tuesday afternoon. The following week the Tokyo Games was postponed and Price, like everyone, was in lockdown - training in her garage in Sheffield. ""It affected me more mentally than anything,"" she said, ""just because I'd been on such a roll of winning. ""I hadn't boxed for 18 months [by the end] so you have a lot of questions in your head. Even though you're doing the training, it's totally different when you're in that ring. ""Luckily enough I had a good team behind me and they got me through it and peaked me at the right time."" But while Price continued to train hard in Sheffield for the rearranged Tokyo Games, at home in Ystrad Mynach her granddad Derek's health was sadly deteriorating. He had been diagnosed with dementia some years before and although the pride he felt for his granddaughter had burned through when he spoke to BBC Wales in 2019, it was obvious he could no longer remember all the precise details of Price's early sporting success. Lauren speaks to her nan every night and goes back home to see her whenever she can The man who took Price to every boxing session, every kickboxing competition and every football match died in November 2020. ""He was such a big part of my life,"" Price says. ""He was my number one fan. ""He got me involved in it and he was sport mad. I'd go everywhere with him. ""For me I take it as a blessing that he's not suffering any more. I tried to prepare myself for it but when it happens there's nothing like losing someone. So I was in a bit of a state."" Price was home when he passed away. She stayed for the funeral but then flew to San Diego for a training camp. The Olympics were eight months away and, as Linda says, Price's granddad would not have wanted her to miss out. The qualifying event was eventually held in Paris in June. Price took the gold to secure her spot in Tokyo in style. She went back home, as she always did after a big competition. Usually she would show her granddad any medal she had won. Even when Derek was ill, Price says, she could tell he was still proud. This time her granddad was not there. So Price placed her medal next to the vase that held his ashes. It is still there. ""A bit strange I know,"" Price says. ""But normally I'd give it to him and he wasn't there. ""For me the biggest thing I take from it is I know he's looking down on me and he's with me. ""We got there in the end."" This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge meets Team GB boxer Lauren Price The story of Lauren Price had one more remarkable chapter before she left for Tokyo. She was invited to Kensington Palace to be interviewed by the Duke of Cambridge. Price calls her nan every night, wherever she is, and Linda responds with encouraging text messages. The Duke joked we could all use that and she should start a motivational texting business. He then proceeded to give Price a cake to mark her 27th birthday. Price - level-headed as ever - took the whole experience in her stride. She arrived in Tokyo, completed her final preparations and walked out towards the ring to face Mongolian fighter Myagmarjargal Munkhbat. She was an Olympian. But what more could she achieve? She beat Munkhbat in the round of 16 and then beat Panama's Atheyna Bylon to guarantee herself an Olympic medal. The semi-final pitted her against long-time Dutch rival Nouchka Fontijn. The woman Price had beaten to win her European Games and World Championship titles - but who had beaten her twice this year already. Fontijn won the first round and looked on course to end Price's Olympic dream. But a brilliant final-round performance from the Welsh fighter secured a narrow win and a place in the final. China's Li Qian, the 2018 world champion, now stood in her way but Price dominated from the start, outworking and outmanoeuvring her taller opponent. With the first two rounds going to Price, her opponent needed a stoppage or knockout in the final round. But the Welsh southpaw's pressure was unrelenting and she skilfully took that as well for a 5-0 points victory, with a 30-27 winning margin on all five judges' scorecards securing the Olympic title - and Britain's 22nd and final gold in Tokyo. Lauren Price controlled the Olympic final against China's Li Qian from start to finish Price also became the second British woman to win boxing gold after Adams' flyweight successes in 2012 and 2016 and the first Welsh boxer to achieve Olympics success. At the family home in Ystrad Mynach, framed on the wall, is the phrase that Price was always told by her nan. 'Reach for the moon and if you fall short, you will land on the stars.' But this is the story of a girl who reached for the moon and grabbed it. A kickboxing world champion, an international footballer and an Olympic boxing champion. The result of years of dedication, hours of hard training and, of course, the love and support of her nan and granddad.

Kim calls for relief work in flood-hit North Korea,"This video can not be played North Korea is struck by severe flooding, leading to homes destroyed and thousands of people evacuated North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called on the military to carry out relief work in areas recently hit by heavy rains, state media report. More than 1,000 homes were damaged and about 5,000 people evacuated after the ensuing flooding, state television reported earlier this week. The move comes amid concerns over an economic crisis and food shortages. Agricultural land has been damaged, and Kim Jong-un said in June the country faced a ""tense"" food situation. He said at the time the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding, and that much would depend on this year's harvest. ANALYSIS:Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? Footage from the state-run KCTV showed homes flooded up to their roofs, as well as damaged bridges and railroads in the eastern province of South Hamgyong. It also said about 17km (10 miles) of roads and bridges had been damaged. The report said ""hundreds of hectares of farmland"" were also submerged or lost as river levees collapsed, AFP news agency reports. The ruling Workers' Party's Central Military Commission held a meeting on Thursday to discuss recovery from the disaster,the official KCNA news agency said,external. Mr Kim did not attend the meeting, but party officials conveyed his message that the military should provide necessary supplies in the region, KCNA said. With the soil already saturated, further rains could cause more damage. Heavy rain was forecast until 10 August, with eastern areas expected to be particularly hit, according to the country's meteorological agency. North Korea is struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programme. The country has also closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19, leading to trade with China - which North Korea relies on for food, fertiliser and fuel - plummeting as a result. North Korea suffered from a nationwide famine in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union left it without crucial aid. The total number of people who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million. Thousands evacuated from North Korea floods.

Afghan cities fall to rapid Taliban advance,"Afghan security forces have faced a major blow with the loss of Kunduz The Taliban have captured three regional capitals in Afghanistan as they continue to make sweeping territorial gains in the country. They seized control of the key northern city of Kunduz on Sunday, as well as Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan. It means five regional capitals have fallen to the militants since Friday, with Kunduz being their most important gain this year. The Taliban said there is no agreement on a ceasefire with the government. A spokesman for the group warned against further US intervention in Afghanistan while speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Sunday. Violence has escalated across Afghanistan after US and other international forces began to withdraw their troops from the country, following 20 years of military operations. Taliban militants have made rapid advances in recent weeks. Having captured large swathes of the countryside, they are now targeting key towns and cities. The three northern cities fell to Taliban control within hours of each other on Sunday, with one resident in Kunduz describing the situation as ""total chaos"". The Afghan government, meanwhile, said its forces were fighting to retake key installations. Heavy fighting has also been reported in Herat in the west, and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. Thousands of civilians have been displaced this year. Families, including babies and young children, have been sheltering in a school in the north-eastern city of Asadabad. ""Many bombs were dropped on our village. The Taliban came and destroyed everything. We were helpless and had to leave our houses. Our children and ourselves are sleeping on the ground in dire conditions"", Gul Naaz told AFP. ""There was firing, one of my seven-year-old daughters went out during that fighting and disappeared. I don't know if she is alive or dead,"" another displaced resident said. Displaced children take refuge at a school in Asadabad, Kunar province near the Pakistan border The US has intensified its air strikes on Taliban positions, with Afghan military officials saying militants have been killed. But the Taliban say the air strikes hit two hospitals and a school in the city of Lashkar Gah. Neither claim has been independently verified. The US embassy in Afghanistan condemned the Taliban's ""violent new offensive against Afghan cities"", saying the group's actions to ""forcibly impose its rule are unacceptable"". ""They demonstrate wanton disregard for the welfare and rights of civilians and will worsen this country's humanitarian crisis,"" it said in a statement. By Khalil Noori, BBC News, Kabul This attack on a number of strategic cities and their fall to the Taliban was unprecedented. But as the deadline for the full withdrawal of foreign forces approached, a big change on the battlefield was expected. Now it is time for the Afghan government to prove that its well-equipped forces, 350,000 strong, are able to retake the lost areas. It would be difficult for the Taliban to hold Kunduz, but for several weeks the group has kept control of commercial centres important for trade with Iran and Pakistan. The populations in cities taken by the Taliban are paying the price of war, having lost loved ones or property. They are having to leave their homes, fearing the launch of a government operation to retake the cities. Peace talks with the Taliban in Doha are deadlocked. If the process resumes, from now on both sides will be trying to control the larger area to justify a greater share of power, if they agree on a transitional government. The seizure of Kunduz is the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May. The city, home to 270,000 people, is considered a gateway to the country's mineral-rich northern provinces. And its location makes it strategically important as there are highways connecting Kunduz to other major cities, including Kabul, and the province shares a border with Tajikistan. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan FROM THE ARCHIVE:Kunduz, the city the Taliban seized That border is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which then finds its way to Europe. Controlling Kunduz means controlling one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region. It also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye travelled to Afghanistan's Kunduz province, most of which has fallen to the Taliban By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Former British Gen Sir Richard Barrons says there is a danger of Afghanistan feeling ""friendless"", in the wake of recent battlefield defeats and the possible withdrawal of diplomats and contractors from Kabul if things get worse. It is much too early to speculate about a Saigon-style withdrawal from the capital, echoing the way the Americans hastily left Vietnam in the final act of the war there, in 1975. But in recent days, British and American calls for their nationals to leave the country threaten to create a dangerous narrative. It is something that western military planners have been worried about for some time, following US President Joe Biden's decision, in April, to withdraw American forces by 11 September. In June, classified UK Ministry of Defence documents were found at a Canterbury bus stop by a member of the public. One of them voiced just this concern, speaking about the need to counter an ""abandonment narrative"" in Afghanistan. ""Precise language may be needed,"" it said, ""to avoid misunderstandings about 'retrograde to zero' vs normal diplomatic (including military) representation."" ""Retrograde to zero"" is the peculiar euphemism used to describe the withdrawal process now in its final weeks. In other words, planners were only too aware of creating the dangerous impression that Afghanistan might indeed be left ""friendless"". That is not yet the case. American air strikes are still being used in an attempt to halt the Taliban's advances. Britain and the US will doubtless have hidden assets on the ground, working feverishly to stem the tide of the war. Who are the Taliban?

Virgin Atlantic considers listing on stock market,"Sir Richard sold a stake in his Virgin Galactic space business to help prop up the airline's finances Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is exploring a possible listing on the London stock market to raise money to repair the airline's finances. The move could see shares offered to private investors as well as big City firms, but mean he loses overall control of his flagship business. Virgin Group owns 51% of the airline, and US-based Delta Air Lines the rest. It is understood Virgin has hired City advisors to draw up flotation plans, but the airline called it speculation. Like most airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been battered by the coronavirus collapse in air travel. In April, the airline posted a Â£659m loss for 2020 after passenger numbers dropped 80%, and it has announced thousands of job cuts. Selling a stake in the airline would raise much-needed funds as global aviation rebuilds. However, the share prices of airlines such British Airways-owner IAG and Easyjet are still significantly lower than pre-Covid levels amid widespread scepticism among some investors about how long it will take the industry to recover. Virgin Galactic may sell up to $500m of shares Virgin space flight tickets to start at $450,000 News of a possible stock market launchwas first reported by Sky News,external. It said Virgin Atlantic's advisors, including banks Citi and Barclays, have in recent weeks been pitching the possible flotation to several potential big investors, which had responded positively to the idea. Virgin Atlantic revenues are heavily dependent on UK-US services, and the airline is hoping for a rapid rebound in services as lockdown restrictions ease. Earlier this year, chief executive Shai Weiss said he did not expect to see a big drop in fares as travel resumes. A flotation would mark the first time Virgin Atlantic shares have been sold to the public, and would likely see Virgin Group's stake fall below 50%. Sir Richard founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, and its success enabled him to build a business empire that now includes the Virgin Galactic space travel arm. But the airline's survival appeared in doubt last year, with administrators put on standby while Sir Richard negotiateda Â£1.2bn rescue package. That package included a loan from the American hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management. Sir Richard had tried to secure rescue funds from the UK government, which refused his request, and use his Necker Island holiday resort as collateral to raise money. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson called reports of a possible flotation ""speculation"" and declined to comment further.

Price wins boxing gold for Britain,"This video can not be played GB's Lauren Price beats China's Li Qian to win gold in the women's middleweight boxing Britain's Lauren Price became the first Welsh fighter to win an Olympic boxing gold medal as she beat China's Li Qian in the women's middleweight final. Price, 27, gained a 5-0 points victory at the Kokugikan Arena in Tokyo to earn Britain's 22nd gold of the Games. She becomes the second British woman to win boxing gold after Nicola Adams' flyweight successes in 2012 and 2016. Britain have won 65 medals in Tokyo, matching their London 2012 total, with 22 golds, 21 silvers and 22 bronze. Tokyo 2020 medal table Who won GB's medals? Team GB athletes' results ""I can't really put it into words - it's a dream come true,"" Price told BBC Sport. ""I still have to pinch myself. It's been years of hard work and if you dream and work hard enough you can achieve anything. ""I'm just over the moon and I want to thank everyone who supported me on this journey from eight years old."" Price's grandfather Derek passed away in November and, in an emotional interview, Price dedicated her gold medal to him and also to her grandmother Linda. ""It's for him and my nan - I knew he would be looking down on me today and all week really,"" said Price, who was raised by her grandparents from three days' old. ""I can't really put into words what they've done for me over the years, I just love them both so much. ""Big shout out to my nan, I can't wait to see her and show my medal off."" This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge meets Team GB boxer Lauren Price Price, who has played international football for Wales and been a world kickboxing champion, won the opening round against former world champion Li with all five judges, able to pick off punches against her taller opponent thanks to quick hands and feet. She continued to dominate in the second round, controlling the pace and tempo with her 31-year-old opponent struggling to land. Four of the judges gave that round to Price, meaning Li needed a stoppage or knockout in the final round. But Price was never in danger in the third as her near-flawless performance gave her a 30-27 winning margin on four judges' scorecards and a 29-28 victory on the other one. Adams, watching from the BBC studio, said Price had been an overwhelming winner. ""Lauren had her tactics spot on and Li just couldn't cope,"" said the double gold medallist. ""She made it look easy - it was like watching a spar. ""She dealt with all the pressure really well."" Price had already become only the third Welsh boxer to win an Olympic boxing medal after Fred Evans won welterweight silver at London 2012 and Ralph Evans won a light-flyweight bronze at the 1972 Games in Munich. The Newport-born fighter has also represented Wales at international level in different age groups in netball and taekwondo and won world, European and British honours in kickboxing. She played 52 times as a defender for Wales' national football team across the age groups - winning two senior caps - before she focused on boxing. Lauren Price (number five) played 52 times for the Wales national women's football team She quickly set history by becoming the first Welsh woman to win a Commonwealth Games medal with a bronze in Glasgow in 2014, before taking gold four years later on Australia's Gold Coast and then winning a World Championship gold medal in 2019. Price's gold was Britain's second in the ring in Tokyo following Galal Yafai's win in the men's flyweight competition on Saturday. Pat McCormack (men's welterweight) and Ben Whittaker (men's light-heavyweight) both won silvers while Frazer Clarke (men's super-heavyweight) and Kariss Artingstall (women's featherweight) collected bronze medals. It means Team GB won six medals - two gold, two silver and two bronze - from their 11-strong team, the most British boxing medals at a Games since Antwerp in 1920, although they did win three golds at London 2012. Earlier on Sunday, Ireland's Kellie Harrington beat Brazil's Beatriz Ferreira in thewomen's lightweight final. Harrington, 31, who works as a cleaner at a hospital in Dublin, became the second Irish woman to win boxing gold after Katie Taylor took lightweight gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. It was a superb performance from Harrington, who collected a unanimous points victory, with two of the five judges giving her the win by 30-27 margins, and the other three scoring it 29-28 in her favour.

"Quarantine-free travel from France to UK resumesSome travel firms report a ""surge"" of bookings but others say it is ""too late to save the summer"".UK","Visitors to Paris no longer have to quarantine on their return, after UK fears over the Beta variant faded Fully vaccinated people can now visit France without quarantining on their return to the UK, after travel rule changes came into force at 04:00 BST. Brittany Ferries said it had received a ""surge"" of bookings following the rule changes announced on Thursday. But travel agents said the relaxation of quarantine for one of the UK's most popular destinations came ""too late to save the summer"". Meanwhile, travellers in Mexico had to rush back to avoid hotel quarantine. Under the latest changes to the UK's traffic light system for travel, the rules have been relaxed for a dozen countries. France moved from its own amber-plus category on to the amber list, which means children and fully vaccinated passengers do not have to quarantine on their return, although unvaccinated travellers still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days. It comes as the UK recorded 27,429 new Covid cases on Sunday, as well as 39 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Sunday's data means that after a consistent fall since mid-July, the weekly total of cases has shown a slight increase over the previous seven days, of 1.9%. Which countries are now on the green list? Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean Why was France put on the amber-plus list? International cruises from England to restart Among those to benefit from the rule changes is Emma Wood, who lives in Laon, France. Her parents, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, are planning to visit France next week to meet Emma's six-month-old daughter for the first time. ""We're so pleased but we daren't get our hopes up until they're here,"" she said. ""They were going to come before but then they introduced the new amber-plus list."" She said she usually saw her parents five or six times a year but had not seen them in more than 12 months. ""My mum has been desperate to see her granddaughter,"" she added. Emma Wood can't wait for her parents to meet their new granddaughter Londoner Kyle Frank has also booked a trip after the change was announced. He plans to drive to Nice because he feels it is safer than taking a plane - and so he can bring his puppy, Indy, with him. ""It would have been great to book it before but everything has been changing so rapidly it's hard to understand when it will be safe to travel. So I'm trying to go now while I can,"" he told the BBC. ""There's no quarantine when I get back to London so I can get straight back to work."" Kyle Frank says he plans to drive to France, so he can travel with his puppy, Indy Moved from amber to green:Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway Moved from amber-plus to amber:France Moved from red to amber:India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE Moved from amber to red:Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, said the company had seen bookings surge after it was announced travel rules for France were being relaxed. But the company still only expects to carry a quarter of its usual number of passengers. ""Let's be realistic, we would need tens of thousands of people booking to make up for the poor season,"" Mr Mathieu said. ""It's more than welcome this announcement, it's good news, but it comes in a year when at the end of the day for us everything is about 2022 and making that a real, normal year."" The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England - althoughWales criticised the UK governmentfor not consulting them. There are now 36 countries onthe green list,external- from which even unvaccinated travellers do not have to quarantine - following the addition of seven more nations, including Germany, Austria and Norway. And India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been moved from the red list to the amber list. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit. But one travel agent said the latest changes had only made a small difference and testing requirements were still putting many Britons off booking foreign trips. ""It's far too late to save the summer,"" said Julia Lo Bue-Said, from the Advantage Travel Partnership. She said a lot of people had already made their holiday plans and the increase in bookings had been ""marginal"". ""When you think that most businesses are 80% down, you need a huge volume to make up the shortfall they're experiencing,"" she said. Four destinations are also subject to tighter restrictions. Mexico, Georgia, and the French overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, have been added the red list. Only British citizens, Irish citizens, and UK residents can travel from red list countries and they must stay for 10 days in hotel quarantine at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult - which increases to Â£2,285 from 12 August. Lotis Bautista, one of thousands of Britons on holiday in Mexico when the announcement was made, paid hundreds of pounds to cut short her trip by a week and rush back home before Sunday's deadline. She said she and her husband could not have afforded the costs of hotel quarantine. ""I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't incredibly upset when it happened. Even though you know there are risks, you hope there might be a more responsible way of doing things from the government,"" Ms Bautista said. ""We're eighteen months into he pandemic and we're still being being given two, three days' notice."" TOKYO OLYMPICS:Can Shauna Coxsey help Radio 1's Jordan North overcome his fear of heights?

PSG only 'one possibility' for Messi,"This video can not be played Lionel Messi in tears as he receives ovation from Barcelona at news conference An emotional Lionel Messi said joining Paris St-Germain was ""a possibility, but nothing is agreed"" as he confirmed his exit from Barcelona. Messi is ending his 21-year association with Barca, whocannot afford to honour the new contract they agreedwith him because of La Liga's salary limit. The record six-time Ballon d'Or winner, 34, is now a free agent. ""My family and I were convinced we were going to stay here, at home,"" he said during a news conference on Sunday. ""This is the end with this club and now a new story will begin,"" added the Argentina forward. ""Yes, it's one of the most difficult moments for me. Messi says goodbye to Barcelona - as it happened ""I don't want to leave this club - it's a club I love and this is a moment I didn't expect. ""Last year I wanted to leave, this year I wanted to stay. That's why I'm so sad. ""It was like my blood ran cold. I was really sad. It was really difficult right up to now. I'm still trying to process it all. ""When I get home I will still feel bad; it will be even worse. I'm not ready for this."" Lionel Messi won 35 trophies with Barcelona after making his first-team debut aged 17 in October 2004 Messi, Barcelona's record goalscorer,submitted a transfer requestlast summer before agreeing to stay for the final year of his contract. That expired on 1 July and Messi is nowin talks over a move to PSG,where he would play alongside Kylian Mbappe and former Barca team-mate Neymar. ""It is a possibility, but I have not agreed anything with anyone,"" he said. ""I have got different clubs interested. Nothing is definitive but clearly we are talking to them."" Messi left Argentina for Spain when he was 13 and made his first-team debut for Barcelona aged 17 in October 2004. He went on to score 672 goals in 778 games and helped the Spanish giants win 35 trophies, replicas of which were displayed at his news conference at the Nou Camp. Would Messi give PSG football's best front three? ""I'm so grateful for the love that everyone's shown me, for all my team-mates, and the club being by my side,"" he said. ""Today I have to say goodbye to all this. ""I arrived when I was very young, 13 years old, and after 21 years I am leaving with my wife and three Catalan-Argentine children. ""I cannot be more proud of everything I did and lived in this city. I have no doubt that, after a few years away, we will return because it is our home."" Messi added: ""I'm leaving the club without seeing the fans for over a year and a half [due to the pandemic]. If I imagined it, I would imagine the Camp Nou full, and to say goodbye properly. But it has to be this way."" This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Messi looked set to extend his stay at the Nou Camp havingagreed a new five-year contractin July, halving theÂ£123m a season he reportedly receivedin his previous contract. The agreement was dependent on player departures to get Barca's wage bill under La Liga's limit, however, and the club were unable to do so. ""I offered to reduce my salary by 50% and they didn't ask me for anything else,"" Messi said. ""It is not true that they asked me for anything more. ""I only know that it was not possible because of La Liga, because the club did not want to go into more debt."" Barcelona president Joan Laporta said on Friday that trying to keep Messi could have put the club at risk for 50 years. Once it became clear Barca were unable to honour the contract they had agreed with Messi, his representatives contacted PSG, but wherever Messi goes next, he said he wants to ""play my last years competing for titles"". He also had a warning for his former Barca team-mate Dani Alves after the 38-year-old right-backhelped Brazil win Olympic goldto extend his record for career titles to 43. ""I congratulate Dani Alves and warn him that I am going to fight to catch up with him and surpass him,"" Messi added. ""It's my mentality. I have to find my way to keep competing and winning."" Hundreds of fans were at the Nou Camp and his family were on the front row at the news conference, with Messi's wife Antonella handing him a tissue Hundreds of fans gathered outside the Nou Camp and several of Barcelona's first-team players were also in attendance. Messi was in tears as he walked on to the stage and he received a round of applause before, during and after his news conference. Andres Iniesta, who won the Champions League four times with Messi, tweeted: ""We shared magical moments and always stayed together. Imagining the club without you or being able to see you at the Camp Nou with another shirt is difficult."" Xavi Hernandez, another member of that legendary Barca midfield, added: ""I can only thank you for everything you have given us during these years. Whatever you do, I wish you the best."" Current Barca captainGerard Piquesaid: ""Nothing will ever be the same again. Not the Camp Nou, not the city of Barcelona, âânot ourselves. The reality, sometimes, is very harsh.""

Watch: Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony,"Use play icon at top of page to watch closing ceremony (UK only) Tokyo 2020 Olympics have officially closed Japan hands over the Olympic baton to Paris, which hosts 2024 Games Cyclist Laura Kenny was Great Britain's flagbearer Choose your favourite GB medal moment from our shortlist of 16 Jonathan Jurejko For so long we didn't think Tokyo 2020 would happen. But it did and, boy, has it been enjoyable. After all the uncertainty, doubt, anger and scepticism from many - including plenty of the Japanese people - the first postponed Olympic Games went ahead to the relief of many. Some will still have reservations about its success, but for others there have been highs and lows, thrills and spills, golden moments which they will remember forever. We've shared these moments together and we'll remember them forever. Cue BBC montage... Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony Only just joining us? Where have you been?! But if you are late out of the blocks, here is what you have missed... The Tokyo Olympics, postponed and played out behind closed doors because of the Covid pandemic, concluded with an upbeat ceremony in Japan's capital. The Games took place without spectators and athletes were barred from venturing outside the Olympic village. Their staging has faced local opposition and around 30 protestors jostled with police at the National Stadium before the closing ceremony. However, other locals have braved heat and warnings to watch events from afar. Read our full report from the closing ceremony here. The Paralympics opening ceremony is on Tuesday, 24 August. The Winter Olympics kicks off in Beijing on 4 February, 2022. The next Summer Olympics - Paris 2024 - will run from 26 July to 11 August. Team GB enjoyed another memorable and hugely successful Olympic Games at Tokyo 2020 but what was your favourite moment? We've drawn up a shortlist of 16 from the 65 British medals won - make your choice from the selection on the right of this page or by clicking the 'vote' tab if you're on mobile. Team GB matched their medal total from London 2012 on the final day of the Tokyo Games. Track cyclist Jason Kenny's historic gold moved GB up to 64 medals on Sunday, hours before boxer Lauren Price won gold in the middleweight final. That puts Britain on 65 medals - equalling their performance as hosts nine years ago and making Tokyo their second-most successful overseas Olympics after Rio 2016. They claimed 22 golds, 21 silvers and 22 bronze medals in Japan. Talking of numbers, here is how Great Britain have fared over the past fortnight in terms of the only currency that counts at the Olympics... The gathered athletes fill the Tokyo night sky with a rousing round of applause as the ceremony - and a memorable Games - comes to a close. The lights come on like its 2am in your local nightclub, without the boozy staggering outside. They could be some loitering outside the exit in the hope of some number-swapping though... Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony Andrew CotterClosing ceremony commentator on BBC TV The flame goes out. Thank you, Tokyo. We look ahead to the Paralympic Games which begin in two weeks' time. But wait! It's not all over yet. For the first time in history, the Olympic closing ceremony has a prelude to the Paralympic
Games. This is to highlight how the Olympics will lead into the
Paralympics and are not the end of Tokyo 2020. The Paralympic
Games, of course, begin on 24 August with extensive digital and radio coverage right here on the BBC Sport website. The flame finally disappears. The woman
and the children curl their hands into a ball as the moon replaces the sun and the lights go out on Tokyo 2020. ""The movement
is suggestive of a prayer and alludes to how each and every one
of us in the world similarly wishes for peace, prays for the souls
of those who are no longer with us, and feels gratitude,"" say the organisers. Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony Hazel IrvinePresenter on BBC TV The cauldron which was the sun becomes the moon, to the strains of Clair de Lune. Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony Andrew CotterClosing ceremony commentator on BBC TV Now we lead to the extinguishing of the Olympic flame. This is the second Olympics to be held in Tokyo so we look back over the years to these Games taking place. Each line of the song is about a different constellation and the woman singing to the children is passing on her legacy to different generations. The Olympic flame, which burned brightly throughout the 17 days of 
the Games, is set to be extinguished. And that, my friends, will be us sayingsayonarato the Tokyo Games. A woman and a group of children appear in the National Stadium, making for a symbolic scene for Tokyo, which is 
hosting the Games for the second time and will be transitioned to 
the next generation. Reckon we've got about 10 minutes to go in this tear-jerker Japanese/French arthouse film. Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony The first postponed Olympic Games were only made a reality because of ""the unified and powerful support of so many"", says IOC president Thomas Bach. ""This is why our thanks and appreciation go to the Japanese authorities who have stood by our side with the athletes,"" he said. ""Our heartfelt gratitude goes to Organising Committee and the thousands of volunteers who have demonstrated such determination and dedication in these challenging times. ""The billions of people around the globe who followed these Olympic Games admired Japanese for what they have achieved. ""We did it together. We did for the athletes."" ""I declare the Games closed,"" are the final words of Bach in English. Impressive switching between English, Japanese and French from the German. Bravo. With the athletes gathered in front of the stage, Bach uses the opportunity to congratulate them on their performances and then starts on a list of 'thank yous'. That is longer than that of a groom at a wedding. ""We did it - together!"" he tells the recipients. Next up in front of the microphone is Thomas Bach, the IOC president. Did you know he is a former Olympic 
champion? He doesn't mention it much. If you didn't, the German won a gold medal in fencing (team foil) at the 1976 Games in Montreal. Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony Seiko Hashimoto pays tribute to the thousands of athletes, coaches and volunteers who have made a ""difficult"" and ""challenging"" event possible. ""The athletic events of the past 17 days have inspired us, given us courage, and shown us hopes for the future,"" says Hashimoto. ""I would like to express my feelings of gratitude and respect to all the athletes, and to everyone else who overcame so many difficulties to so thoroughly prepare for these Games and deliver their absolute best performances."" Back to Tokyo then. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo 
Organising
Committee 
of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, addresses the athletes and 
the viewers from the stage in the middle of the Olympic Stadium. Before entering politics, Hashimoto competed at seven Olympic Games, both as a track cyclist and 
a speed skater at the 1992 summer and winter Olympic 
Games. After moving into politics in 1995, she has held positions such as Minister of State 
for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, and Minister for Womenâs 
Empowerment. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Taliban capture key northern Afghan city,"Afghan security forces have faced a major blow with the loss of Kunduz The Taliban have captured three regional capitals in Afghanistan as they continue to make sweeping territorial gains in the country. They seized control of the key northern city of Kunduz on Sunday, as well as Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan. It means five regional capitals have fallen to the militants since Friday, with Kunduz being their most important gain this year. The Taliban said there is no agreement on a ceasefire with the government. A spokesman for the group warned against further US intervention in Afghanistan while speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Sunday. Violence has escalated across Afghanistan after US and other international forces began to withdraw their troops from the country, following 20 years of military operations. Taliban militants have made rapid advances in recent weeks. Having captured large swathes of the countryside, they are now targeting key towns and cities. The three northern cities fell to Taliban control within hours of each other on Sunday, with one resident in Kunduz describing the situation as ""total chaos"". The Afghan government, meanwhile, said its forces were fighting to retake key installations. Heavy fighting has also been reported in Herat in the west, and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. Thousands of civilians have been displaced this year. Families, including babies and young children, have been sheltering in a school in the north-eastern city of Asadabad. ""Many bombs were dropped on our village. The Taliban came and destroyed everything. We were helpless and had to leave our houses. Our children and ourselves are sleeping on the ground in dire conditions"", Gul Naaz told AFP. ""There was firing, one of my seven-year-old daughters went out during that fighting and disappeared. I don't know if she is alive or dead,"" another displaced resident said. Displaced children take refuge at a school in Asadabad, Kunar province near the Pakistan border The US has intensified its air strikes on Taliban positions, with Afghan military officials saying militants have been killed. But the Taliban say the air strikes hit two hospitals and a school in the city of Lashkar Gah. Neither claim has been independently verified. The US embassy in Afghanistan condemned the Taliban's ""violent new offensive against Afghan cities"", saying the group's actions to ""forcibly impose its rule are unacceptable"". ""They demonstrate wanton disregard for the welfare and rights of civilians and will worsen this country's humanitarian crisis,"" it said in a statement. By Khalil Noori, BBC News, Kabul This attack on a number of strategic cities and their fall to the Taliban was unprecedented. But as the deadline for the full withdrawal of foreign forces approached, a big change on the battlefield was expected. Now it is time for the Afghan government to prove that its well-equipped forces, 350,000 strong, are able to retake the lost areas. It would be difficult for the Taliban to hold Kunduz, but for several weeks the group has kept control of commercial centres important for trade with Iran and Pakistan. The populations in cities taken by the Taliban are paying the price of war, having lost loved ones or property. They are having to leave their homes, fearing the launch of a government operation to retake the cities. Peace talks with the Taliban in Doha are deadlocked. If the process resumes, from now on both sides will be trying to control the larger area to justify a greater share of power, if they agree on a transitional government. The seizure of Kunduz is the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May. The city, home to 270,000 people, is considered a gateway to the country's mineral-rich northern provinces. And its location makes it strategically important as there are highways connecting Kunduz to other major cities, including Kabul, and the province shares a border with Tajikistan. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan FROM THE ARCHIVE:Kunduz, the city the Taliban seized That border is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which then finds its way to Europe. Controlling Kunduz means controlling one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region. It also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye travelled to Afghanistan's Kunduz province, most of which has fallen to the Taliban By Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Former British Gen Sir Richard Barrons says there is a danger of Afghanistan feeling ""friendless"", in the wake of recent battlefield defeats and the possible withdrawal of diplomats and contractors from Kabul if things get worse. It is much too early to speculate about a Saigon-style withdrawal from the capital, echoing the way the Americans hastily left Vietnam in the final act of the war there, in 1975. But in recent days, British and American calls for their nationals to leave the country threaten to create a dangerous narrative. It is something that western military planners have been worried about for some time, following US President Joe Biden's decision, in April, to withdraw American forces by 11 September. In June, classified UK Ministry of Defence documents were found at a Canterbury bus stop by a member of the public. One of them voiced just this concern, speaking about the need to counter an ""abandonment narrative"" in Afghanistan. ""Precise language may be needed,"" it said, ""to avoid misunderstandings about 'retrograde to zero' vs normal diplomatic (including military) representation."" ""Retrograde to zero"" is the peculiar euphemism used to describe the withdrawal process now in its final weeks. In other words, planners were only too aware of creating the dangerous impression that Afghanistan might indeed be left ""friendless"". That is not yet the case. American air strikes are still being used in an attempt to halt the Taliban's advances. Britain and the US will doubtless have hidden assets on the ground, working feverishly to stem the tide of the war. Who are the Taliban?

Kenny wins seventh Olympic gold in keirinBut wife Laura's reign as women's omnium champion has ended.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Jason Kenny wins the men's keirin to claim his seventh Olympic gold Jason Kenny became the first Briton to win seven Olympic gold medals with a spectacular defence of his men's keirin title - but wife Laura's reign as women's omnium champion has ended. Laura, GB's most successful female athlete, recovered from a crash in her first event to finish sixth in her bid for a third successive omnium title. Jason stunned the men's keirin field as he sprinted clear with three laps remaining to claim victory. It is his ninth Olympic medal overall. The 33-year-old wonsilver in the team sprintat the Izu Velodrome to become GB's most decorated Olympian earlier this week but was unable to defend his individual sprint title. His tally of seven golds is one more than former team-mate Sir Chris Hoy. ""Seven gold medals is really special. When you look back on the ones you have already got, it seems pretty easy,"" said Jason. ""Then when you try and get more, you remember how hard it is. ""I have been disappointed this week, I haven't been as competitive as I wanted to be. But in the keirin you can race hard and ride your luck a little bit."" On his future, he added: ""Before today I had all but given up, I was counting my career in days and races as opposed to years, but maybe I have bought myself more time now."" Laura and Jason Kenny - Team GB's golden couple Sporting drama amid a state of emergency: How will Tokyo 2020 be remembered? Team GB to match London 2012 with 65 medals won Follow live coverage of the final day of Tokyo 2020 Tokyo 2020 medal table Jason Kenny is the most successful British Olympian, while Laura Kenny is Britain's most successful female Olympian Jason caught his five rivals by surprise with a long-range attack and held on to finish 0.763 seconds clear of Malaysia's Azizulhasni Awang, with the Netherlands' reigning world champion Harrie Lavreysen taking bronze. Lavreysen made it three medals in Tokyo but had been aiming to emulate Jason's achievement of five years ago by winning all three men's sprint events. The Briton said his decision to attack early was made before the race. He told BBC Sport: ""I said [beforehand] if I get a gap [I'll go] and he [performance director Stephen Park] said very unconvincingly 'if it is a big one'. The first half a lap I was wondering if it was enough and then I thought 'it is now or never', so I will go for it. ""I have been racing every race like it is my last, just trying to survive really. ""I think because I ran every race like it was a final, when I got to the final I was pretty well rehearsed. For me it was [a case of] carry on doing what we have been doing."" This video can not be played Jason Kenny reacts to winning seventh Olympic gold with victory in keirin Laura, speaking about Jason's performance, told BBC Sport: ""The amount of people who came up to me afterwards and were like 'I'd have counted him out of this' - and to be honest, so had I! ""I was speaking to him last night and he was like 'I just want to go home'. Then obviously he won - just typical Jason, that."" Jason progressed from a semi-final that also included compatriot and individual sprint bronze medallist Jack Carlin, but the 24-year-old failed to qualify for the final after finishing fourth. Contesting the race to decide the minor positions, Carlin finished second to claim an eighth-placed overall finish. Laura and Jason Kenny have won 19% of all Great Britain's track cycling medals ever This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Laura Kenny beaten by US's Jennifer Valente to finish 6th in omnium In the omnium, Laura arrived at the fourth and final event - the points race - down in ninth position and 38 points adrift of top place after a fall in the scratch event. Brought down in a pile-up on the penultimate lap of the competition's first of four disciplines, she then came out on top in the tempo race before finishing a disappointing 13th in the elimination race - widely considered her specialist event. The Briton - along with nine others - received 16 points as the officials decided to award the fallen riders the next available number of points in the opening scratch race, placing Kenny 24 points behind the early lead. The five-time Olympic gold medallist, who became the first British woman to win gold at three Olympic Games whenshe and Katie Archibald won the madisonon Friday, recovered to fifth at the halfway stage after winning the tempo. However, she was left with too much to do in the final points race - despite taking maximum points in the final sprint - as American Jennifer Valente took gold from Japan's Yumi Kajihara and Dutch rider Kirsten Wild. Between them, Jason (nine) and Laura Kenny (six) have won 15 Olympic medals On the crash, Laura told BBC Sport: ""I hit them so fast because I was just about to come over and bam, I literally had nowhere to go and I had a mountain to climb. ""[In] the tempo race I just rode off adrenaline and then we only had 20 minutes. When I got into the elimination race I just felt really tired instantly and I just thought 'this is bad'. ""In the points race I had nothing to lose. I just wish we had got a lap and then obviously I would have jumped up the standings."" On winning a gold in Tokyo, she said: ""To be honest I was done after the madison. You just hit such a high. That really was the race that we targeted. We put so much work into that and I think because we did win you just go 'job done'. ""Worlds isn't that far away is it?"" she added on her future. ""I don't know. I don't see myself quitting any time soon."" Earlier, GB team-mate Katy Marchant finished sixth in the women's sprint competition as she contested the race for fifth to eighth position.

"NHS waiting lists could hit 14m in England - reportCurrently five million people are on hospital waiting lists, but there is a warning of a hidden backlog.Health","Those waiting for more than a year for an operation has risen to almost 388,000 compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began, NHS statistics shows Up to 14 million people could be on NHS waiting lists in England by next autumn, new analysis suggests. Currently, some five million are waiting for routine operations and procedures - many of whom are in pain. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned there is a huge hidden backlog of patients who are still yet to come forward for treatment. The government pointed to the Â£1bn it had given to the NHS this year to clear the backlog. There have been repeated warnings over the length of hospital waiting lists in England. A record number of patients are currently waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with more than 385,000 patients waiting more than a year, compared to just 1,600 before the pandemic. 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' The huge NHS challenge facing Sajid Javid Hospital waiting list tops 5m in England Last monthHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he had been shockedto learn that waiting lists could rise to 13 million patients. The IFS decided to crunch the numbers to see whether this was likely - it said Mr Javid's warning is ""well within the realms of possibility"". In order to stop numbers getting that high, the NHS needs to treat even more patients than it did before the pandemic, the IFS said. Explaining how it reached its conclusions, the IFS said that after Covid hit in March last year, seven million fewer people joined waiting lists than was normal. It is not yet known how many of these ""missing patients"" will come forward for treatment - but the IFS predicts that their return will increase waiting lists and put the NHS under more pressure. ""Even if only two-thirds of the missing patients return then with capacity at 95% of pre-pandemic levels - much more than the NHS is currently managing - waiting lists could easily exceed 13 million (and keep growing),"" said the IFS. ""Expanding capacity will be the only solution to cutting waiting lists in the future."" And the IFS said the number could even soar to 14 million by autumn 2022 - and continue to increase - if 80% of the missing patients return and the NHS operates at 90% of its capacity levels in 2019. This report argues there are millions of ""missing patients"" from the waiting lists who might have been expected to join it but haven't  - perhaps because they're worried about Covid infections or their conditions haven't been picked up yet. The researchers have looked at different scenarios depending on what happens next to these patients. In one scenario, if the NHS can't treat more patients than it did pre-pandemic, the waiting list could rise to 14 million by next autumn. Even in the most optimistic projection, the IFS says it could rise to nine million by 2025, but that would need the NHS to be able to work at 5% more capacity than it did before the pandemic and would come at a cost of at least Â£2bn. If the NHS can't boost capacity, the IFS warns, longer waiting lists will be with us for years to come. The IFS said it was unlikely that all of the seven million missing patients would return, since some may have died, sought private treatment or chosen to live with their health issues - but they said most will probably come forward at some point. Earlier this year, the doctors' union urged people to remember that the waiting lists were not just ""numbers on a spreadsheet"". They are ""real people in pain"" who are distressed,the British Medical Association said.,external One woman from Hampshiretold the BBCthat her hip pain was unbearable. ""It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with,"" she said. A new chief executive for NHS England was appointed last month - Amanda Pritchard. She acknowledged the NHS had ""big challenges ahead"", including the need to tackle backlogs. The union for nurses said the IFS analysis showed the ""immense task"" that lies ahead - and called on Mr Javid to invest in the workforce. The Royal College of Nursing added: ""A significant pay rise will demonstrate value and help retain experienced nursing staff whom health services can't afford to lose with this challenge ahead."" And Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the modelling should be a ""wake-up call for ministers"". ""Years of underfunding and cuts to healthcare had already left our NHS with ballooning waiting lists before the pandemic hit. ""Given these warnings it's now even more urgent that a long-term rescue plan is put in place to give the NHS the resources and staff it needs to bring down waiting lists and reducing waiting times for treatment."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was backing the health service with Â£9.6bn to help it recover from Covid. ""This includes dedicated investment of Â£1bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists, including by increasing capacity. The NHS is also trialling innovative ways to accelerate elective recovery and enable more hospitals to go further, faster.

Virgin Atlantic considers listing on stock marketThe move could see Sir Richard Branson lose overall control of the airline he founded.Business,"Sir Richard sold a stake in his Virgin Galactic space business to help prop up the airline's finances Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is exploring a possible listing on the London stock market to raise money to repair the airline's finances. The move could see shares offered to private investors as well as big City firms, but mean he loses overall control of his flagship business. Virgin Group owns 51% of the airline, and US-based Delta Air Lines the rest. It is understood Virgin has hired City advisors to draw up flotation plans, but the airline called it speculation. Like most airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been battered by the coronavirus collapse in air travel. In April, the airline posted a Â£659m loss for 2020 after passenger numbers dropped 80%, and it has announced thousands of job cuts. Selling a stake in the airline would raise much-needed funds as global aviation rebuilds. However, the share prices of airlines such British Airways-owner IAG and Easyjet are still significantly lower than pre-Covid levels amid widespread scepticism among some investors about how long it will take the industry to recover. Virgin Galactic may sell up to $500m of shares Virgin space flight tickets to start at $450,000 News of a possible stock market launchwas first reported by Sky News,external. It said Virgin Atlantic's advisors, including banks Citi and Barclays, have in recent weeks been pitching the possible flotation to several potential big investors, which had responded positively to the idea. Virgin Atlantic revenues are heavily dependent on UK-US services, and the airline is hoping for a rapid rebound in services as lockdown restrictions ease. Earlier this year, chief executive Shai Weiss said he did not expect to see a big drop in fares as travel resumes. A flotation would mark the first time Virgin Atlantic shares have been sold to the public, and would likely see Virgin Group's stake fall below 50%. Sir Richard founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, and its success enabled him to build a business empire that now includes the Virgin Galactic space travel arm. But the airline's survival appeared in doubt last year, with administrators put on standby while Sir Richard negotiateda Â£1.2bn rescue package. That package included a loan from the American hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management. Sir Richard had tried to secure rescue funds from the UK government, which refused his request, and use his Necker Island holiday resort as collateral to raise money. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson called reports of a possible flotation ""speculation"" and declined to comment further.

The 33-year-old wonsilver in the team sprintat the Izu Velodrome to become GB's most decorated Olympian earlier this week but was unable to defend his individual sprint title. His tally of seven golds is one more than former team-mate Sir Chris Hoy. ""Seven gold medals is really special. When you look back on the ones you have already got, it seems pretty easy,"" said Jason. ""Then when you try and get more, you remember how hard it is. ""I have been disappointed this week, I haven't been as competitive as I wanted to be. But in the keirin you can race hard and ride your luck a little bit."" On his future, he added: ""Before today I had all but given up, I was counting my career in days and races as opposed to years, but maybe I have bought myself more time now.""

"Swimmers warned over river sewage and pollutionWaterways have become increasingly popular places to swim, especially with pools closed in lockdown.Wales","Waterways have become increasingly popular places to swim, especially with pools closed in lockdown Swimmers planning a dip in Wales' rivers have been warned to be wary of sewage and pollution before diving in. Waterways have become increasingly popular places to swim, especially with pools being closed during lockdown. DÅµr Cymru's own figures revealed that in 2020, raw sewage was dumped in Wales' rivers more than 100,000 times for almost 900,000 hours. The Welsh government said it had spent millions of pounds on Wales' waters and 46% of rivers were ""at good status"". But wild swimmer Angela Jones said her favourite waterway, the River Wye, was ""dying"" because of sewage and farm pollution. Dubbed the ""Wild Woman of the Wye"", Ms Jones said she had been monitoring the state of its waters and, in her 35 years on the river, she had never seen it in such a state, with sections where she would not swim any longer. Why wild swimming is Britain's new craze Water firm fined Â£90m for deliberate sewage spills Pollution causing river âdeath by a thousand cutsâ ""It's just disrespect from water companies and farmers treating it like an open sewer,"" the 55-year-old said. In April, DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water said 100,000 discharges happenedacross more than 2,000 water treatment works and sewer overflowsacross the Welsh network in 2020. And over the years DÅµr Cymru has been fined hundreds of thousands of pounds forkilling fish,spilling chemicalsas well as dumping sewage. Ms Jones, who sometimes spends as much as 40 hours a week in the Wye, reports the problems she sees. Angela Jones monitors the quality of the water flowing along the River Wye ""It's companies, it's people, it's businesses who just think it's an easy way to get rid of sewage, wash-off from poultry farms, everything,"" she said. ""I desperately want to protect the river and feel like I am letting it down."" She called for greater accountability, changes to the law and greater fines for those found to have polluted. In December, a report by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) foundmore than half of the River Wye was failing to meet pollution targets. Concerns have been raised about the effects of phosphates from chicken farmson pollution levels in the Wye. But, while NRW said poultry farms in Powys were having an impact, it said the reasons behind the pollution were more complex and sources were varied. Ms Jones recently highlighted the state of the Wye by swimming a kilometre (0.6 miles) along the river in Monmouth while towing a coffin bearing the words ""Death of the Wye"", alongside paddle boarders dressed as grim reapers. This video can not be played Wild swimmer Angela Jones says she hopes her specially designed coffin will catch attention ""When you see the amount of sewage that is dumped, it is diabolical,"" said Angela, who lives in Monmouthshire. ""There is no way I am going to give up on this river."" In April, the BBC's Panorama highlighted DÅµr Cymru as one of the worst offenders among UK water companiesfor dumping untreated sewage. Environmentalist George Monbiot highlighted algae which has flourished in rivers like the Wye. According to the Natural Environment Research Council, this is caused by excess phosphorus from sewage, and run-off from fields fertilised with phosphorus compounds. It also leads to a reduction of oxygen in water. BBC Wales - BBC Wales - The Merthyr Mermaid New pollution rules 'compel farmers to change' Natural resources used at 'unsustainable rate' Mr Monbiot drew attention to damage wrought on rivers by farming as chemicals and nitrates from the dung of cattle, pigs and chickens ran into them. He added: ""We are seeing a comprehensive ecological collapse going on in Wales' rivers."" The Welsh government has designated the whole of Wales a ""nitrate vulnerable zone"" (NVZ) and introduced stricter rules on the storage and spread of slurry, in a bid to tackle river pollution. But a farming union ischallenging Wales' pollution rules in the High Court. Afonydd Cymru, which represents river trusts, said sewer overflows needed to be addressed, but warned replacing the existing system would take decades and cost billions of pounds. It said agricultural pollution had worsened as livestock farming intensified. Chairman Chris Mills said: ""Waste products being produced from this farming are simply too great for the land to cope with, coupled with inadequate storage capacity, inappropriate spreading, and poor land use management."" Environmentalist George Monbiot says Wales' rivers were facing a ""comprehensive ecological collapse"" Monmouth MP David Davies is calling on the Welsh government to follow the UK government and bring in new legislation to tackle river pollution. The UK government says its Environment Bill would include new legal duties to tackle sewage discharges into rivers. Mr Davies, a wild swimmer himself, said: ""It is absolutely vital we protect our waterways"". NFU Cymru said it was concerned about ""false claims"" made about poultry farming. Wales a haven for wildlife - but for how long? Battle to save 'slimy' as well as 'cute' creatures Welsh rivers farm pollution 'embarrassing' A spokeswoman said: ""Despite claims from some campaigners regarding the impact of poultry farming within the Wye catchment, a recent NRW report is clear that the overall pattern of failures in the Wye does not support the hypothesis that poultry units are the main, or even a particularly important reason, for nutrient failures within the catchment."" The Welsh government said it had provided Â£9.5m during this financial year to improve water quality in Wales, and that 42% of Wales' water bodies and 46% of rivers were at ""good status"". But, it added: ""Pressures from the past, such as legacy chemicals, will affect the water environment for decades to come."" Natural Resources Wales' Ceri Davies said it had a range of projects to improve the health of Wales' rivers, citing its Â£6.8m ""Dee life"" scheme. ""We have prosecuted water companies three times over the past six years, whilst five prosecutions have been related to agricultural pollution,"" she said. NRW's Ceri Davies says the government body has prosecuted water companies three times in the past six years DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water said it had invested more than Â£85m in the past decade on removing phosphorus from rivers, including at 10 locations on the Wye, where it said it had been responsible for ""less than a third"" of phosphorus. ""We are committed to working collaboratively with all bodies involved and to play our part in helping to further enhance river water quality,"" a spokesman added.

Track cyclist Jason Kenny'shistoric goldmoved GB up to 64 medals on Sunday, hours before boxerLauren Price won goldin the middleweight final. That puts Britain on 65 medals - equalling their performance as hosts nine years ago and making Tokyo their second-most successful overseas Olympics after Rio 2016. They claimed 22 golds, 21 silvers and 22 bronze medals in Japan. Britain won 67 medals at the Rio Games - finishing second in the medal table - and UK Sport had set a medal target range of between45 and 70 medalsfor these delayed Olympics. GB's most successful female athlete, Laura Kenny, was chosen to carry the British flag inSunday's closing ceremony. Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: ""At Rio 2016, Great Britain became the first country to improve on its medal tally in the Olympics after being the host - and Team GB have now become the first to equal or win more medals at each of the next two Games.""

Team GB's medal aspirations were revised down by the governing body to take account of the ""extraordinary circumstances"" presented to athletes and staff in the build-up to the Games. UK Sport said success would also be measured in a ""broader and more holistic"" way than just medals. Team GB have finished Tokyo 2020 in their lowest position on the medal table since the 2008 Games in Beijing despite matching their London 2012 total Team GB finish Tokyo 2020 fourth in the medal table behind the USA, China and Japan - their lowest position since Beijing 2008. Team GB chef de mission Mark England hailed the medal haul in Tokyo as ""the greatest achievement in British Olympic history"". He said: ""Not only has the team made history but it has probably made history on the back of the most complex and most challenging and difficult environment that we will face certainly in my lifetime. ""It has been against all the odds and I think it is the greatest achievement in British Olympic history. It has been the miracle of Tokyo."" England believes the team is in great shape before the 2024 Games in Paris. ""The Bryony Pages of this team, winning another bronze after her silver medal in Rio, and the women's artistic gymnastics team winning a bronze with two 16-year-old twins - these kept the scoreboard ticking over and gave everybody the confidence that the team is in great shape,"" he said. ""We've had 16 fourth places. This is a very, very young team and a very talented team, and a team I'm absolutely confident that will go to Paris in less than three years and do exceptionally well."" Six-time Olympic cycling gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy told BBC Sport that the British team ""should be incredibly proud"" of their achievements in Tokyo. He added: ""Expectations were mixed going into it. Certain sports didn't perform as expected, others overachieved. ""You get payment in kind for a gold. We have a limited pot of money and you have to use that as best you can. It's about intelligent use of money, thinking outside the box and being inventive. ""They have done us all proud - a great performance."" Team GB won medals in 25 sports in Tokyo - more than any other country. We've grouped some sports together for this chart This video can not be played Jason Kenny reacts to winning seventh Olympic gold with victory in keirin Jason Kenny successfully defended his keirin title to become the first Briton to win seven Olympic gold medals.

Kipchoge suffered his first marathon defeat in seven years in London last October, but he looked in control throughout the race in Sapporo, Japan, before moving well clear of the field after 30km. The Kenyan - whose official marathon record is the 2:01:39 he ran in Berlin in 2018 - won 5,000m bronze in 2004 and silver in 2008, before claiming his first Olympic gold in Rio five years ago.

"Pubs busy as most Covid rules end in WalesSocial distancing ends, but face masks are still needed in shops and on public transport.","Pubs were busy as rugby fans headed out to watch the Lions face South Africa Towns and cities in Wales are getting busy, with a ""big party"" predicted after the end of most Covid regulations. Wales has moved to Covid alert level zero, meaning social distancing rules and most other restrictions have ended. Nick Newman of the Cardiff Licensees Forum said bars started filling up from 11:00 BST. Masks are still needed in shops, and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to be sensible. 'Weâre going out and weâre buzzing' Be sensible, says Wales' top doctor Q&A: What are the new Covid rules in Wales? The UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed. Case rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a ""third wave of coronavirus infection"". Mr Newman said customers had been ""fantastic"" and ""voted with their feet"" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. ""A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,"" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain. ""So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for."" ""At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after."" How will we adjust to life without so many rules? Hospitality rules change after '18 months of hell' However, he said some measures remained in place. At one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. Tiny Rebel Brewery staff and customers celebrated ""freedom day"" in Newport The first minister said on Friday he wasconfident Wales was on the ""final lap""of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no ""further unexpected turns in the course of the virus"". However, he warned against a ""free-for-all"" after most restrictions ended. In England,most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called ""Freedom Day"" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged. Most restrictions in Scotland will end on Monday NI has highest Covid-19 infection rate in UK The 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic. Across the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses. Bosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place. ""We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,"" said team leader Naomi Saunders. ""For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute."" Towns and cities around Wales have been busy with the end of social distancing, including Caernarfon The Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. Landlord Martin Barron said: ""I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out."" He said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because ""we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there"". Customers can order at the bar of The Three Horseshoes again, but Mr Barron has put control measures in place to limit any risk The Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. Emma McClarkin, chief executive, said: ""This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for. ""A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter."" Although staff are relieved about easing restrictions, they still want customers to feel safe Staff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a ""huge relief"". Laura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: ""A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible."" She also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to ""challenge non-mask wearers"", after ""hardly anyone was complying"" with the rules after the first lockdown. Ms Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. Retailer Philip Bottrill has been preparing his stationery shop for fewer restrictions Philip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move ""steadily"" and ""gently"" toward normality. ""It isn't going to happen overnight,"" he said. ""But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019."" While some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. Sasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt ""excited"" about rules relaxing but was ""really cautious"" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. Shielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future,chief medical officer Frank Atherton said,external. ""Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,"" she said. That became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up. âWeâve been shut out for quite some time,â Ms Robbins says He ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. She said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Blind people in Wales frustrated by vaccine access ""Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,"" she said. She urged people not to ""forget"" disabled people. Rhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society. Ms Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could ""exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen"" without ""strong messaging from public bodies"". ""Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,"" she said. Jessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. ""The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,"" she said. The first competitive community rugby matches in Wales since March 2020 are set to take place around Wales on Saturday Crickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020. Bleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said ""everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go"". ""Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,"" he said. ""You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'"" Six weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. The team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.

'Weâre going out and weâre buzzing' Be sensible, says Wales' top doctor Q&A: What are the new Covid rules in Wales? The UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed. Case rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a ""third wave of coronavirus infection"". Mr Newman said customers had been ""fantastic"" and ""voted with their feet"" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. ""A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,"" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain. ""So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for."" ""At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after."" How will we adjust to life without so many rules? Hospitality rules change after '18 months of hell' However, he said some measures remained in place. At one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. Tiny Rebel Brewery staff and customers celebrated ""freedom day"" in Newport The first minister said on Friday he wasconfident Wales was on the ""final lap""of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no ""further unexpected turns in the course of the virus"". However, he warned against a ""free-for-all"" after most restrictions ended. In England,most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called ""Freedom Day"" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged. Most restrictions in Scotland will end on Monday NI has highest Covid-19 infection rate in UK The 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic. Across the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses. Bosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place. ""We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,"" said team leader Naomi Saunders. ""For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute."" Towns and cities around Wales have been busy with the end of social distancing, including Caernarfon The Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. Landlord Martin Barron said: ""I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out."" He said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because ""we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there"". Customers can order at the bar of The Three Horseshoes again, but Mr Barron has put control measures in place to limit any risk The Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. Emma McClarkin, chief executive, said: ""This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for. ""A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter."" Although staff are relieved about easing restrictions, they still want customers to feel safe Staff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a ""huge relief"". Laura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: ""A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible."" She also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to ""challenge non-mask wearers"", after ""hardly anyone was complying"" with the rules after the first lockdown. Ms Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. Retailer Philip Bottrill has been preparing his stationery shop for fewer restrictions Philip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move ""steadily"" and ""gently"" toward normality. ""It isn't going to happen overnight,"" he said. ""But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019."" While some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. Sasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt ""excited"" about rules relaxing but was ""really cautious"" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. Shielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future,chief medical officer Frank Atherton said,external. ""Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,"" she said. That became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up. âWeâve been shut out for quite some time,â Ms Robbins says He ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. She said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Blind people in Wales frustrated by vaccine access ""Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,"" she said. She urged people not to ""forget"" disabled people. Rhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society. Ms Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could ""exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen"" without ""strong messaging from public bodies"". ""Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,"" she said. Jessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. ""The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,"" she said. The first competitive community rugby matches in Wales since March 2020 are set to take place around Wales on Saturday Crickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020. Bleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said ""everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go"". ""Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,"" he said. ""You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'"" Six weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. The team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.
