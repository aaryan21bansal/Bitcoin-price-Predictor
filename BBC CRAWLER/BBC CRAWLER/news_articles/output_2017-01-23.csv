UK's Eurovision hopefuls revealed,"Lucie Jones and Danyl Johnson both competed on X Factor in 2009 This year's UK Eurovision hopefuls have been revealed - and every one of them is a former X Factor contestant. Among the more recognisable names are Lucie Jones and Danyl Johnson, who both featured in the 2009 series, which was eventually won by Joe McElderry. Jones's song has the best pedigree: Never Give Up On You is written by 2013 Eurovision winner, Emmelie de Forest. TV talent has good form at Eurovision, with two previous winners graduating from singing contests like X Factor. Mel Giedroyc will host Eurovision: You Decide on Friday Swedish singer Loreen, who won the competition in 2012, was previously a runner-up on Swedish Idol, where she performed under the name Loren Talhaoui. More recently, Mans Zelmerlow triumphed at the 2015 contest  - having earned his stripes on Swedish Idol and Let's Dance, which is his home country's version of Strictly. This year's UK's entry will be selected on Friday, 27 January, in a live BBC Two show hosted by Mel Giedroyc. A combination of viewer and jury votes will decide the winning song - with Bruno Tonioli and Sophie Ellis-Bextor forming part of the eight-person jury. Danyl Johnson - Light Up the World This video can not be played Danyl Johnson - Light Up The World Former schoolteacher Danyl Johnson was, at one point, the bookies' favourite to win X Factor 2009. He eventually came fourth - losing out to Joe McElderry and runner-up Olly Murs - and earned brief notoriety after being (sort-of) outed by Danni Minogue. The singer, who currently works as an ambassador for  the People's Postcode Lottery, enters Eurovision with a empowering dance track about ""shining a light in the darkness"" - harking back to Katrina and the Waves' Eurovision-winning song in 1997. It aims for anthemic but ends up sounding anaemic. Key lyric:""We couldn't see, yeah, standing in the dark."" Holly Brewer - I Wish I Loved You More This video can not be played Holly Brewer - I Wish I Loved You More Holly has previously sung at the wedding of Mark Wright (The Only Way is Essex) and Michelle Keegan (Coronation Street) - and received four ""yeses"" from the X Factor judges in 2015. However, producers axed her from the programme by phone in a pre-bootcamp contestant cull - Cowell and co presumably underestimated the cost of accommodation in Wembley. Never fear, for now Holly is returning with a power ballad co-written by Courtney Harrell, a former contestant on The Voice US. A decent effort which sounds like it could have been found on Kelly Clarkson's studio floor. Key lyric:""You're the sunlight the the preacher talks about. Ooh-ooh, Amen."" Lucie Jones - Never Give Up on You This video can not be played Lucie Jones - Never Give Up On You Lucie Jones will be remembered by the die-hard X Factor enthusiasts for coming eighth in the 2009 series - finishing behind fellow Eurovision hopeful Danyl Johnson and, er, Jedward. While she might have crashed out of the live finals fairly early, she should be more confident of winning the UK Eurovision race - as her song is co-written by Emmelie de Forest - the Danish singer-songwriter who won the song contest in 2013. Her vocals have improved remarkably since 2009, but the song is untroubled by percussion and ends up a slightly dreary piano ballad (not necessarily an obstacle to Eurovision victory). Key lyric:""Together we'll dance through this storm."" Nate Simpson - What Are We Made Of? This video can not be played Nate Simpson - What Are We Made Of? ""You opened your mouth and Jesus came out,"" said Nicole Scherzinger when Slough-born Nate Simpson auditioned for the X Factor last year. That didn't stop her kicking him out at the judges's houses round, though. Maybe if he'd kept Jesus in there for a little longer... The 23-year-old is hoping to go to Eurovision with the piano ballad What Are We Made Of?. It has a key change before the first chorus, which gives you an indication of what you're in for. Key lyric:""We're breathing underwater and the struggle makes us stronger."" Olivia Garcia - Freedom Hearts This video can not be played Olivia Garcia - Freedom Hearts Canadian singer Laurell Barker has been busy on the songwriting front this year because, as well as penning Holly's song, she has writing credits on Olivia Garcia's. Olivia is fresh from the most recent series of X Factor. She made it as far as judges houses, but Simon Cowell sadly didn't take her through to the live shows. She's now joined the Eurovision race with a propulsive ballad that could lend itself to a dramatic staging (we're thinking acrobats and a tug of war). Garcia's vocal acrobatics, meanwhile, do a good job of showing Cowell what he missed. Key lyric:""Shiny hair and shoes, how about me and you?"" Salena Mastroianni - I Don't Wanna Fight This video can not be played Salena Mastroianni - I Don't Wanna Fight A distant relative of the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni (La Dolce Vita; Divorce, Italian Style) Salena has a degree in fashion, but ditched the runway to pursue a career in music. After working as a wedding singer for four years,she auditioned for X Factor in 2012,externalbut failed to progress beyond the initial stages. Instantly catchy, her song I Don't Wanna Fight is the most contemporary of this year's Eurovision entries, with a trance-house beat that's proved successful for other countries in recent years. Although the lyrics appear to carry an anti-war sentiment, Mastroianni says the song is about a relationship. Key lyric:""Why can't we put our weapons down?""

Thatcher's secret test drive revealed,"Margaret Thatcher test-drove the new Rover outside 10 Downing Street - but not before a practice session Officials feared Margaret Thatcher could crash Rover's new car when she test-drove it for a photocall, newly released papers suggest. A secret rehearsal was arranged at Chequers for the then PM to ""familiarise"" herself with the vehicle. Hernewly released personal files,externalcover 1986, when Michael Heseltine quit over the so-called Westland affair and the US launched bombing raids in Libya. They have been published by the Thatcher Foundation. The documents reveal careful planning behind the scenes to avoid anything going wrong with the Rover 800 photoshoot at Downing Street. The PM's private secretary Mark Addisonwrote to her,external: ""You are test driving the new Rover on Thursday. ""The most straightforward way of arranging this would probably be for you to drive the car from the front door towards the bottom of Downing Street, reversing into the side road, and then driving back up the street to the front door. ""If you would like to handle the test drive in this way, you would need to feel fully confident about manoeuvring the car into the side road and back out again. ""The alternative would be to walk down to the car at the bottom of Downing Street and drive it back to the front door. ""Agree to the first option? Or prefer to keep it simple."" In another memo, Mr Addison told her the car was being towed, under cover, to Chequers for her to rehearse beforehand. Chris Collins, from the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust, said he believed Mrs Thatcher had seldom driven since 1975, leading to concern from officials. ""I think I'm reading between the lines but I'm reasonably confident that there was that worry, that there was this dark fear that she would crash into something, that it would all go horribly wrong, and after all she hadn't driven for many many years,"" he said. The trust is overseeing the release of Mrs Thatcher's private files through the Churchill Archive Centre in Cambridge. The files also reveal concerns that a blue, not a red, car should be supplied, but in the end the stunt passed without a hitch. Things went less smoothly for the prime minister when she tripped over a manhole at the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth. In a letter to the mayor apologising for pulling out of a civic ball that evening, she said: ""As you may have heard I tripped over one of Bournemouth's manholes this afternoon and my ankle didn't like it very much. Neither did the manhole!"" Other papers in the newly released batch include aletter - written but never sent - from Mrs Thatcher to the then defence secretary Michael Heseltine,externalwarning him to toe the line or give up office over the Westland affair. The battle for control of British helicopter manufacturer Westland was one of the most divisive political rows of Mrs Thatcher's second term in office. Former Defence Secretary Lord Heseltine stormed out of cabinet over the Westland affair The letter, drafted three weeks before Mr Heseltine resigned over the row, tells him the government's view of the future of British helicopter manufacturer Westland is that it is ""a matter for the company to decide"", adding: ""In this situation no minister should use his position to promote one commercial option in preference to another - so long as he remains in government."" A more minorhelicopter-related exchange,externalinvolved a request for Mrs Thatcher to use one to travel the short distance from Downing Street to the opening of the Broadgate development in the City of London. In a hand-written note, the PM dismissed the ""ridiculous"" suggestion, saying it would be an ""unwarrantable extravagance and I should be criticised severely"". The documents also cover the fallout from the US air strikes in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, for which Mrs Thatcher allowed the use of British airbases. Onenote,external, before the PM was due to speak on the subject, said an ""unusually large number of calls"" had been received by Conservative Central Office expressing concern about the raids. Another revealed a warning from a senior civil servant that Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit's ""obsession"" with attacking the BBC's coverage of the military strikes risked a repeat of the ""Westland troubles"".

Irish town plagued by Babestation calls,"Westport is a picturesque coastal town, popular with tourists and pilgrims who flock to the nearby Croagh Patrick mountain Residents of a County Mayo town are being plagued by callers trying to reach X-rated TV channel Babestation. People in Westport are up in arms over late-night landline calls intended for the UK-based station. The mix-up is a result of Irish viewers calling the show's premium-rate numbers, which start with 098, without adding the international dialling code. Regional Development Minister Michael Ring said his constituents were ""aggravated and annoyed"". Mr Ring told the Sunday Independent: ""They are getting these calls in the middle of night. ""One of those people has an elderly mother and family members all over the world and there could be a call at any time that they would have to take."" He said people in the town should not have to change their phone number because of the blunder. The Fine Gael politician has referred the matter to a number of authorities, including the police, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and ComReg, the Republic of Ireland's communications sector regulator. The minister told the paper the police ""did everything they could"" but they had limited powers. Several regulatory bodies are looking into the issue BAI chief executive Michael O'Keeffe said it had contacted Babestation on behalf of one complainant and spoken to a representative about the issue. ""It is unfortunate that this issue is still continuing,"" he added. ""However, the BAI is not in a position to address the problem as it is not within our remit and he was advised at all times we were assisting him as a matter of courtesy."" A spokeswoman for ComReg said it had been in contact with its UK counterpart and it was trying to ""identify a solution as soon as possible"". ""ComReg advises anyone calling the UK from the Republic of Ireland should always use the prefix 00 44,"" she said. Mr Ring has also contacted the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA), the UK regulator for goods and services charged to a phone bill, such as directory enquiries and votes to TV talent shows. A PSA spokesman said it was looking into the problem.

What executive orders has Trump signed?,"This video can not be played What exactly is an executive order, and how significant are they to a president's legacy? One of the first ways a new president is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders. While legislative efforts take time, a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice. President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege. Given his predecessor's reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency, he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle. What are executive orders? Here's a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far: Mr Trump signed the order at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undoing a key part of the Obama administration's efforts to tackle global warming. The order reverses the Clean Power Plan, which had required states to regulate power plants, but had been on hold while being challenged in court. Before signing the order, a White House official told the press that Mr Trump does believe in human-caused climate change, but that the order was necessary to ensure American energy independence and jobs. Environmental groups warn that undoing those regulations will have serious consequences at home and abroad. ""I think it is a climate destruction plan in place of a climate action plan,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council's David Doniger told the BBC, adding that they will fight the president in court. Immediate impact: A coalition of 17 states filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration's decision to roll back climate change regulations. The challenge, led by New York state, argued that the administration has a legal obligation to regulate emissions of the gases believed to cause global climate change. Mars Inc, Staples and The Gap are among US corporations who are also challenging Mr Trump's reversal on climate change policy. After an angry weekend in Florida in which he accused former-president Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower, Mr Trump returned to the White House to sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban. The executive order titled ""protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States"" was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March. The order's new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system. The updated ban: Temporarily halts entry to citizens for 90-days of six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) Removes Iraq from the previous list, due to increased vetting of its own citizens Delays implementation until 16 March Allows current visa holders to travel to the US Does not affect permanent visa holders (Green Card holders) Suspends the refugee programme for 120 days Treats Syrians like any other refugee or immigrant Removes the religious clause favouring religious minorities - namely Christians Immediate impact: Soon after the order was signed, it was once again blocked by a federal judge, this time in Hawaii. Trump signs new travel-ban directive Surrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers, Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama. The 2015 regulation - known as the Waters of the United States rule - gave authority to the federal government over small waterways, including wetlands, headwaters and small ponds. The rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources, which the president described as ""puddles"" in his signing remarks. Opponents of Mr Obama's rule, including industry leaders, condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington. Scott Pruitt, Mr Trump's pick to lead the EPA, will now begin the task of rewriting the rule, and a new draft is not expected for several years. Immediate impact: The EPA has been ordered to rewrite, or even repeal the rule, but first it must be reviewed. Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obama's rule was announced, so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen. Instead the EPA must re-evaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act. A bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste. Senator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an ""attack on coal miners"". The US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests. An attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses. Described as a ""two-out, one-in"" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney. Some categories of regulation will be exempt from the ""two-out, one-in"" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and ""any other category of regulations exempted by the Director"". Immediate impact:Wait and see. Trump moves to cut business regulation Probably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said. It included: suspension of refugee programme for 120 days, and cap on 2017 numbers indefinite ban on Syrian refugees ban on anyone arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries, with certain exceptions cap of 50,000 refugees The effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US. Immediate impact:Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure. Trump border policy: Who's affected? A fence is already in place along much of the US-Mexico border On Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority. He pledged repeatedly at rallies to ""build the wall"" along the southern border, saying it would be ""big, beautiful, and powerful"". Now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise. One order declares that the US will create ""a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier"". The second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants. It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise. Immediate impact:The Department of Homeland Security has a ""small"" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. The department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed. The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. They argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands. How exactly will Trump 'build the wall'? With the stroke of a pen... On his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access. Mr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement. Keystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change. The second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site. Immediate impact:Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, to move forward with the controversial pipeline. As a result, TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for $15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement. Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraska's Public Service Commission. The Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil. Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed? Dakota Pipeline: What's behind the controversy? In one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system. The order states that agencies must ""waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay"" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers. Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible. Immediate impact: Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation. That means Mr Trump's executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare. Can Obamacare be repealed? Abortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trump's presidency one day after his inauguration What's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from ""providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country"", even if they do so with other funding. The ban, derided as a ""global gag rule"" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back. Anti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them. Immediate impact:The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants. The US State Department has notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US funding for United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) would be withdrawn, arguing that it supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation. The agency has denied this, pointing to examples of its life-saving work in more than 150 countries and territories. This policy will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place - the Guttmacher Institute, Kaiser Family Foundation and Population Action International believe the order, as written, will apply to all global health funding by the US, instead of only reproductive health or family planning. Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean? The TPP pact would have affected 40% of global trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obama's international trade policy, was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail (although he at timesseemed uncertain,externalabout what nations were actually involved). The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US. Therefore the formal ""withdrawal"" is more akin to a decision on the part of the US to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die. Immediate impact: Takes effect immediately. In the meantime, some experts are worried China will seek to replace itself in the deal or add TPP nations to its own free trade negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), excluding the US.

How the barcode changed retailing,"Joseph Woodland explaining his prototype scanner in 1952 In 1948,N Joseph Woodland - a graduate student at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia- was pondering a challenge from a local retailer: how to speed up the tedious process of checking out in his stores by automating transactions. A smart young man, Woodland - known as Joseph - had worked on the Manhattan Project during the War, and had designed a better system for playing elevator music. But he was stumped. Then, sitting on Miami Beach while visiting his grandparents, his fingertips idly combing through the sand, a thought struck him. Just like Morse code used dots and dashes to convey a message, he could use thin lines and thick lines to encode information. A zebra-striped bull's-eye could describe a product and its price in a code that a machine could read. The idea was workable, but with the technology of the time it was costly. But as computers advanced and lasers were invented, it became more realistic. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in.

The striped-scan system was independently rediscovered and refined several times over the years. In the 1950s, an engineer, David Collins, put thin and thick lines on railway cars so they could be read automatically by a trackside scanner. In the early 1970s, IBM engineer George Laurer figured out that a rectangle would be more compact than Woodland's bull's-eye. He developed a system that used lasers and computers that were so quick they could process labelled beanbags hurled over the scanner. Joseph Woodland's seaside doodles had become a technological reality. Meanwhile American's grocers were also pondering the benefits of a pan-industry product code. In September 1969, members of the administrative systems committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of America met their opposite numbers from the National Association of Food Chains.  Could the retailers and the producers agree? Wrigley's chewing gum would be the first product sold via a barcode in 1974 The GMA wanted an 11-digit code, which would encompass various labelling schemes they were already using. The NAFC wanted a shorter, seven-digit code, which could be read by simpler and cheaper checkout systems. The meeting broke up in frustration. Years of careful diplomacy - and innumerable committees, subcommittees and ad hoc committees were required before, finally, the US grocery industry agreed upon a standard for the universal product code, or UPC. It all came to fruition in June 1974 at the checkout counter of Marsh's Supermarket in the town of Troy, Ohio, when a 31-year-old checkout assistant named Sharon Buchanan scanned a 10-pack of 50 sticks of Wrigley's juicy fruit chewing gum across a laser scanner, automatically registering the price of $0.67 (Â£0.55). The gum was sold. The barcode had been born. We tend to think of the barcode as a simple piece of cost-cutting technology: it helps supermarkets do their business more efficiently, and so it helps us to enjoy lower prices. But the barcode does more than that. It changes the balance of power in the grocery industry. That is why all those committee meetings were necessary, and it is why the food retailing industry was able to reach agreement only when the technical geeks on the committees were replaced by their bosses' bosses, the chief executives. Barcode technology required a significant investment for smaller retailers Part of the difficulty was getting everyone to move forward on a system that did not really work without a critical mass of adopters. It was expensive to install scanners. It was expensive to redesign packaging with barcodes - bear in mind the Miller Brewing Company was still printing labels for its bottles on a 1908 printing press. The retailers did not want to install scanners until the manufacturers had put barcodes on their products. The manufacturers did not want to put barcodes on their products until the retailers had installed enough scanners. But it also became apparent over time that the barcode was changing the tilt of the playing field in favour of a certain kind of retailer. For a small, family-run convenience store, the barcode scanner was an expensive solution to problems they did not really have. But big supermarkets could spread the cost of the scanners across many more sales. They valued shorter lines at the checkout. They needed to keep track of inventory. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete With a manual checkout, a shop assistant might charge a customer for a product, then slip the cash into a pocket without registering the sale. With a barcode and scanner system, such behaviour would become conspicuous. And in the 1970s, a time of high inflation in America, barcodes let supermarkets change the price of products by sticking a new price tag on the shelf rather than on each item. It is hardly surprising that as the barcode spread in the 1970s and 1980s, large retailers also expanded. The scanner data underpinned customer databases and loyalty cards. By tracking and automating inventory, it made just-in-time deliveries more attractive, and lowered the cost of having a wide variety of products. Shops in general - and supermarkets in particular - started to generalise, selling flowers, clothes, and electronic products. Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was able to exploit the possibilities barcodes offered Running a huge, diversified, logistically complex operation was all so much easier in the world of the barcode. Perhaps the ultimate expression of that fact came in 1988 when the discount department store Wal-Mart decided to start selling food. It is now the largest grocery chain in America - and by far the largest general retailer on the planet, about as large as its five closest rivals combined. Wal-Mart was an early adopter of the barcode and has continued to invest in cutting-edge computer-driven logistics and inventory management. The company is now a major gateway between Chinese manufacturers and American consumers. Its embrace of technology helped it grow to a vast scale, meaning it can send buyers to China and commission cheap products in bulk. From a Chinese manufacturer's perspective, you can justify setting up an entire production line for just one customer - as long as that customer is Wal-Mart. The cost of adopting barcodes initially put off some manufacturers such as Miller Geeks rightly celebrate the moment of inspiration as Joseph Woodland languidly pulled his fingers through the sands of Miami Beach - or the perspiration of George Laurer as he perfected the barcode as we know it. But it is not just a way to do business more efficiently. It also changes what kind of business can be efficient. The barcode is now such a symbol of the forces of impersonal global capitalism that it has spawned its own ironic protest. Since the 1980s, people have been registering their opposition to ""The Man"" by getting themselves tattooed with a barcode. That countercultural fashion statement recognises something important. Yes, those distinctive black and white stripes are a neat little piece of engineering. But that neat little piece of engineering has changed how the world economy fits together.

The Australian MP fighting the trolls,"The first Muslim woman to be a member of parliament in Australia is fighting back against social media trolls who bombard her with sexist and racist abuse. Dr Mehreen Faruqi is an Australian Greens Party MP in the New South Wales Upper House, and a former environmental engineer, who fled an ""oppressive regime in Pakistan"" in 1992 with her husband and infant son. But she has found herself facing a grotesque cascade of abuse unleashed by internet trolls. ""There is this real vile mix of racism and sexism that is happening within Australia from certain people who don't believe I belong to this country, maybe because of my colour or the religion that I belong to. That is pretty upsetting,"" Dr Faruqi told the BBC in Sydney. An MP in Australia's most populous state since June 2013, she is now fighting back against her tormentors. Dr Faruqi reposts the offensive messages but hides the identity of her critics ""I decided to start a project on Facebook and it is called Love Letters to Mehreen. So every few weeks we pick a particularly hate-filled message and I respond to it in a humorous way, and that has really taken off. I think people do appreciate that we are exposing these issues and, of course, it is quite cathartic for myself and my staff as well,"" she explained. Dr Faruqi has been ruthlessly targeted by anonymous assailants online - some have questioned, in the most abusive terms, how a Muslim has ""been let into Australian politics"". Love Letters to Mehreen curates some of the ""racist and sexist filth"" her office receives, which she responds to ""with just a touch of sass"". But she believesthese anti-Muslim views are nothing new,external. Eva Cox has campaigned against bigotry in Australia for more than 60 years For Eva Cox, one of Australia's leading feminist writers, the fight against bigotry and inequality in her adopted homeland has raged for almost seven decades. Soon after arriving in Sydney as a 10-year-old refugee in the late 1940s, she punched another child who had called her a ""nasty Jew"". Born in Vienna three weeks before Hitler's invasion, she grew up in England, while her father joined the British army and later went on to work for the United Nations, resettling refugees. Ms Cox is regularly savaged on Twitter, and believes that online abuse in Australia and beyond is becoming increasingly toxic and menacing. There is, she says, an ""infection in the system"" and she sees historical parallels with the disaffection that coursed through Germany in the 1920s and 30s. ""People have lost faith in the democratic process and they are getting angry. We live in a society which seems to be breeding a large number of aggro, discontented people who are prepared to be incredibly nasty. ""What is happening online is a venting of that particular set of prejudices and I think we need to deal with them,"" she explained to the BBC News website. ""It comes from a sense of being overlooked, neglected and unloved. ""We have got to take that to heart because otherwise we'll drive all that discontentment into something and that was where the Nazi Party came from. It came from people who were deeply discontented with what had happened at the end of the First World War where they had really been pushed too hard, and somebody came up and said, 'We'll make Germany great' and look what happened."" The issue of race in modern Australia, where more than a quarter of the population was born overseas, is complex and contentious. Many Indigenous leaders refer to the arrival of European settlers in 1788 as a racist invasion. There were anti-Chinese riots in 19th Century goldfields. And the White Australia policy restricted non-white immigration in the first half of the 20th Century. Dr Faruqi (third from left) has campaigned for Australians to show more tolerance to refugees Disturbances in the Sydney seaside suburb of Cronulla in 2005 saw clashes between mobs of mostly young white men and Middle Eastern Australians.  More recently, videos uploaded to social media have shown ghastly examples of open bigotry on public transport. ""Australia is a country with a racist history trying not to have a racist future,"" said Andrew Jakubowicz, a professor of sociology at the University of Technology Sydney. ""There are organised racist groups in Australia who take great delight in going out and harming people as much as they can on the basis of their race."" Prof Jakubowicz believes that Australia's colonial past still has a powerful hold on a nation where the ""ruling elite tends to be older, white European or British-origin males"". He adds: ""The elites still have difficulty recruiting people into those sorts of powerful positions who don't share their world views and their orientation. Now, I call that ethnocratic rather than racist."" It's hard to gauge if Australia is tainted by bigotry more than other countries, but All Together Now, a non-profit organisation, reports that a fifth of students at school suffer racism every day, while one in three people experiences similar abuse at work. ""Australia has always had systemic racism,"" says Dr Faruqi. ""Let's not forget our First People still suffer the worst sorts of discrimination and racism in Australia. What we need to do is never get complacent about it.""

GardaÃ­ put cannabis find on display,"Armed GardaÃ­ (Irish police) pose with an estimated 37.5m euros worth of cannabis Police and the Republic of Ireland's revenue service have put cannabis worth 37.5m euros (Â£32m), seized at Dublin Port on Friday, on display. The seizure was bigger than the total quantity of the drug seized in the Republic in the past two years, according to national broadcaster RTE. A total of 1,873 kilos of herbal cannabis was discovered concealed in wide-load containers. They were labelled as containing machinery parts. The containers arrived on a ship from mainland Europe. The drugs were vacuum packed and concealed to avoid detection by X-rays and sniffer dogs. GardaÃ­ and Irish revenue officials with almost 2,000 kilos of cannabis seized at Dublin Port GardaÃ­ (police) said investigations are continuing both locally and internationally. Garda assistant commissioner John O'Driscoll said: ""We are all about trying to achieve results and this, I believe in anyone's estimation, is a great result. ""We are about trying to tackle organised crime in a significant manner. The business of organised crime will be impacted."" He listed a string of recent operations including the seizure of firearms from groups ""intent on killing each other"" in an apparent reference to recent gangland killings in the city.

US-China trade war: What might cost more?,"Imported smartphones could cost Americans more if there's a trade war Donald Trump may be accused of flip-flopping on many issues, but there is one thing he's been remarkably consistent on: China. A nation that's ""raping our country"", he called it on the campaign trail. One that is ""stealing American jobs"". He's promised to slap a 45% tax on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn't start playing fair -  a move that's led to concerns over a US-China trade war. President Trump says his plan is good economics, and would create more jobs in the US. But many economists argue this would hurt US consumers more than it would hurt Chinese businesses. Global research house Capital Economics says American consumers may have to pay up to 10% more for Chinese-made goods if tariffs were imposed. Those goods include things like your laptop, refrigerator and mobile phone. But it's not just Chinese companies making these products. Many US firms have manufacturing bases in China and would be hit by any kind of import tariffs as well. Half of US imports from China are electronics or machines, and that includes Apple's iPhones. But what if the iPhone were to be made completely in the US, which is in theory at least, the new president's goal? At leastone study,externalsays the cost of an iPhone manufactured in the US would only shoot up by 5%. But that's only if the components are still sourced overseas. Make those parts at home - and the price goes even higher, hurting profits of US firms like Apple. It's not just iPhones though. Tariffs would likely hit goods across a variety of sectors. A few other items that might be affected: Jeans Toys - including sex toys School supplies Umbrellas Rubber boots Christmas lights But while the China-bashing may appeal to Mr Trump's voting bloc, it's ""unclear just how they [the Trump administration] would raise these tariffs they keep talking about,"" says Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre. Under US law you can only raise tariffs on the goods of other countries by up to 15%, she adds. ""They may start with slapping tariffs on specific sectors, like Chinese steel,"" Ms Elms continues. ""And that would almost certainly see retaliatory moves from the Chinese."" Christmas lights are another thing that could go up in price in the event of a trade war Capital Economics estimates if the US stopped buying goods from China altogether, it could shave three percentage points off China's GDP. With China's economy already slowing down, this is an unthinkable scenario for Beijing. Social stability depends on economic growth. Already, China has been clear about what a trade war with the US and China could look like. ""A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus,"" reads the state-backed Global Times editorial page. ""US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted."" Many American firms, such as Boeing, depend heavily on business from China, and there are thousands of American jobs back home tied to these businesses. Rising consumption on the mainland and the potential 1.3bn customers means China is a market that American companies cannot afford to be left out of. China's smartphone market for example, is larger than the US's and Europe's combined. Besides planes, these are some other popular US products sold in China. Hollywood films Soybeans - China is thought to currently buy 60% of the US's soybean exports. Orange juice Alfafa sprouts Hay ""Nobody wins in a trade war"", said China's President Xi Jinping in a speech at the recent Davos forum. And if history is anything to go by, then he is right. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, the US Congress slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield US workers. It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act, named after two Republican Congressmen. Other countries retaliated with their own tariffs, a trade war ensued and global trade fell by 66%, dragging down the world economy with it. Some economists argue this made the Great Depression last much much longer than it needed to. Sometimes history, and not economics, is the best teacher. Why is Xi Jinping going to Davos?

Is selfie exhibition just self-promotion?,"Taj Mahal Self-Portrait, a 1966 photograph by George Harrison that features in the exhibition I have never taken a selfie. I'm far too ugly. That said, I have ruined other people's, on those occasions when asked by a friend or arts fan to join them in a smartphone photo. I'm happy to say yes - it's not as if I'm ever going to have to look back at the image. I'd be horrified if I did, and mortified if it appeared in some public context like an art exhibition. I don't like causing offence. Fortunately for us, such an occurrence is highly unlikely but it is possible, and increasingly so. Selfie-themed exhibitions are to museums and galleries what dancefloors are to dads: a tempting opportunity to show how young and trendy they are while in reality communicating the exact opposite. They all seem to be at it, from the venerable Mauritshuis in The Hague to the yoof-loving Tate Modern. The Saatchi Gallery is the latest to jump aboard the selfie bandwagon with a show it says ""will be the world's first exhibition exploring the history of the selfie from old masters to the present day, and will celebrate the truly creative potential of a form of expression often derided for its inanity"". I'm not sure if the ""world's first"" claim is valid, but I'm absolutely certain that the long history of the self-portrait has not been ""derided for its inanity"". Helle Thorning Schmidt (centre) taking a selfie with David Cameron and Barack Obama Some of the greatest works of art ever produced are self-portraits. We know that. It has long been a respected genre used by artists to demonstrate their virtuosity, while having the added advantage of the sitter/model being free. Anyway, to compare a painstakingly painted Rembrandt self-portrait with an opportunist snap taken by Helle Thorning-Schmidt flanked by David Cameron and Barak Obama at Nelson Mandela's funeral is silly. It's like equating the diary entry of a lovelorn teenager with a novel by Alice Munro - they don't stand comparison. Both have their place, both can be art, but they are quite different. When I first heard about the show, it sounded like the sort of idea the gallery's communications department might come up with to attract ""new audiences"". And then I read the press release and discovered it WAS the communications department that came up with the concept. It had help from a PR company called H+K Strategies, part of the globe-spanning WPP Group, which counts Huawei, a Chinese smartphone brand, among its clients. This is not an unconnected fact. Huawei are the sponsors of the Saatchi Gallery show. In fact, according to the press release, they are its co-authors: ""Saatchi Gallery and Huawei, the world's number three smartphone brand, announce they have teamed up to present From Selfie to Self-Expression."" The show also includes Cinzia Osele Bismarck's jellyfish selfie One of the team from H+K Strategies to whom I spoke talked of brainstorming sessions between the parties. She made no mention of breakout groups and brightly coloured pens - but I'd hazard a guess they were present. Selfie to Self-Expression feels like a show that started life writ large in pink letters (with yellow asterisk to the side) on front of a flip-chart. Huawei's involvement explains the comment in the press release about the self-portrait genre being ""derided for its inanity"". I don't think it meant self-portraiture, but selfie-portraiture. This is a show designed to elevate the status of the selfie from what they say can be viewed as an inane activity to an artform. Hence the stated aim to ""celebrate the creative potential of a form of expressionâ¦"". Add to this its commitment to ""highlight the emerging role of the smartphone as an artistic medium for self-expression"", and I think we know the corporate tail is wagging the art gallery dog. I'm not saying this to criticise - needs must and all that. It might be a great show, and even if it isn't there is something marvellously Warholian about an art gallery founded by an ad man conceiving an exhibition with the world's largest ad agency network. As Warhol once said: ""Good business is the best art."" No, the reason I mention the corporate sponsor is because I think its collaboration with the Saatchi Gallery is potentially more interesting than the show itself. The whole project would appear to be rooted in the notion of a new ""purposeful age"" in public relations as spelt out by H+K Strategies. They say: ""In the Purposeful Age companies and institutions have the opportunity to join a meaningful conversation around things that matter, take their place in culture and demonstrate their responsibility to society. ""At H+K our purpose in this new age is to inspire creative and curious conversations that help brands and the public communicate to build better outcomes for everyone."" Okay, it's a tad hyperbolic, but you've got to hand it to them - the Saatchi show is a good example of them practising what they preach. It also helps makes sense of the whole enterprise, unifying the subject matter and the sponsor, which can be captured by simply adding three words to the current exhibition title: Selfie to Self-Expression - to Self-Promotion.

Manager to patient,"Mandy Stevens LinkedIn image. ""Perhaps not the most flattering photo of me, but I'm sharing this awful picture and my story to help increase understanding of the impact of mental illness and to celebrate my recovery."" ""As I have worked in mental health services for 29 years, one would think I would be immune to mental illness."" In aLinkedIn post,externalthat has been shared more than 5,000 times, Mandy Stevens shared a photo of herself, red-eyed with matted hair, in the midst of a depressive episode that resulted in her being hospitalised. She wrote the post on the day she was discharged from a 12 week stay on the inpatient ward at the City and Hackney Centre for Mental Health in London. One thing that struck many people who read Stevens' post on the online professional network was her unique vantage point - she has been both an employee and patient of the UK's National Health Service mental health programme. Stevens began her career in the NHS as a mental health nurse. After 15 years she became a hospital manager, and then a director. Although she has suffered episodes of ""mild to moderate"" depression, she managed it through counselling and very few of her family and friends knew about it. ""There is a huge amount of stigma around mental illness,"" Stevens told BBC Trending, ""and for the past 29 years I have worked in Mental Health Services and seen the negative effect this stigma has on people who use our services. From personal embarrassment, family embarrassment, not accepting diagnoses or treatment, not wanting to attend mental health community services in case they are recognised. There is also stigma amongst family, friends and colleagues, including whispered rumours and avoidance."" Then in November, things changed, and her depression became serious enough to warrant hospitalisation. ""When I was very, very depressed, anxious and suicidal I was so ill I was almost monosyllabic, I could hardy walk properly, I couldn't shower or dress properly. Eating and all the things that we take for granted were a huge struggle. I spent most of every day in bed, crying and wanting to be dead. I was absolutely terrible. So frightening and awful."" ""The absolutely wonderful nurses on Gardner ward at City & Hackney Centre for Mental Health were amazing,"" Stevens says. ""They would come and see me very regularly throughout the day, spend time with me, encourage and support me, listen to me crying and talking and throwing up a huge amount of emotion. The staff nurses and the healthcare assistants were wonderful, accessible and compassionate 24/7. I am so proud of my profession."" Whilst in hospital and after she was over the worst Stevens says she felt a bit like an ""undercover cop"" as she observed how the ward was run. ""Without exception the staff treated all of the patients with dignity and respect."" When asked what she thinks of the state of the NHS right now, Stevens says, ""Very difficult for me to answer this question nowâ¦ I can only talk about my particular experience as a patient in an 'Outstanding Trust' - which has been a great experience."" ""I am, of course, aware that not everyone is as lucky as me to receive this type of care. Unfortunately, mental health services are always seen as the 'Cinderella services' with lower levels of funding and cuts."" Analysis by the King's Fund think tanksays 40% of the 58 mental health trusts in the UK saw budgets cut in 2015-16. It found six of them had seen budgets cut three years in a row. An NHS spokeswoman told the BBC that mental health services were ""wider"" than trusts, and care was funded in other ways. Steven adds that help is there. ""There is a huge range of accessible services across the country. Your GP is usually the best place to start as they can signpost you to local services and, if necessary, they can refer you to formal mental health services, but there are also a wide variety of other services around run by volunteers,"" she says. ""My first message is to reach out to people. Speak to your close family and friends about your mental health, and start opening conversations about it. Don't say 'I'm okay' when you're not okay"" Blog byMegha Mohan,external Next story: Trolls try to trigger seizures - is it assault?

'An Unsuitable Boy',"Karan Johar is one of Bollywood's most influential directors Bollywood director and talk show host Karan Johar's autobiography has kicked off a loud debate on being gay in India, writes Sudha G Tilak. ""Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don't need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won't only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I Karan Johar will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me,"" Johar says in the book. The title of his memoir, An Unsuitable Boy, is a play on A Suitable Boy, the novel by award-winning Indian author Vikram Seth. Seth has publicly spoken up against a draconian Indian law that criminalises homosexuality. His mother, a former judge and writer, has also written about Seth being gay. In aninterviewSeth had said that it was a ""sad dereliction of their responsibility"" when famous Indians refused to come out and be ""role models"" for many others who were suffering silently. However, Johar's memoir, co-authored with journalist Poonam Saxena, does not do that. Supreme Court reopens case on decriminalising gay sex Why India's gay community is in shock Why Indian author Vikram Seth is angry And Bollywood's budding filmmakers, activists and Twitterati have come down on him saying he has only trivialised being gay in his films. They say his decision to hold back from explicitly coming out, and opting to leave ""bold clues"" about his sexuality instead, belittles their suffering. It has never been easy to be openly gay in India In response to the criticism Johar writes, ""The reason I don't say it out aloud is simply that I don't want to be dealing with the FIRs [police complaints]. I'm very sorry. I have a job, I have a commitment to my company, to my people who work for me; there are over a hundred people that I'm answerable to. ""I'm not going to sit in the courts because of ridiculous, completely bigoted individuals who have no education, no intelligence, who go into some kind of rapture for publicity."" According to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an ""unnatural offence"". Last February, the Supreme Court agreed torevisit a previous judgementthat upheld the law. In deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate. However that has not mitigated the outpouring of anger against Johar. One of his strongest critics is Apurva Asrani, a script writer and editor of Aligarh, a gay rights Bollywood film based on true incidents. Asrani went on social media to criticise Johar's autobiography and his resistance to coming out, saying that he was ""appalled"". He called Johar's extract on his sexuality a""regressive and a cowardly statement,external"". Johar's book also details his lonely childhood. He talks about growing up with weight issues in a plush neighbourhood in Mumbai among children of the film industry as his father was a producer. The memoir talks about Johar's friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan The book also talks about Johar's well known friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his spats with Bollywood's leading ladies. Johar's films have been set in locations in America or Britain dealing with the romantic issues of the rich and the beautiful. His films have been criticised for stereotyping women as in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and for peddling fluff. They have often poked fun of gay characters and have used innuendos and jokes while referencing gays in his films. His production house may have backed many meaningful films that have spoken about gay issues with sensitivity, but his own storytelling in his movies and memoir is wanting, say critics. In addition to his films, Johar also hosts a hugely popular television chat show filled with Bollywood's beautiful people discussing their crushes, courting controversies, fuelling gossip and adult jokes. In the show, Johar also allows gay jokes, uses self-mocking throwaway lines about his sexuality and uses innuendo which has irked critics for trivialising his sexuality. But he also has his supporters. ""His book is remarkably candid and courageous. He has shared his vulnerabilities and fears,"" writer and publisher Shobhaa De said of Johar. Johar, one of the cleverest and most influential Bollywood directors, isn't giving the pleasure of saying what everyone knows, gay rights notwithstanding.

What will happen in Trump's first 100 days?,"This video can not be played Can Trump accomplish what he wants? Donald Trump has promised to take Washington by storm. There is almost nothing the new American president does not want to change - policy, tone, foreign relations, the press pool. Mr Trump has told his cabinet nominees to be bold and be bold now. He wants a shake-up of US government and he wants it soon. That is why his first 100 days will be so definitive. He has set the timetable for an ambitious agenda and in the next three months we will find out how much he can really shift. There is a lot happening in Europe also during this 100 days. Britain is beginning the formal process of Brexit and the Dutch will hold elections which could herald the next step in the transatlantic populist march. And of course, the French will gear up for their own election in which the National Front will be the focus of much attention. It is an extraordinary time on both sides of the Atlantic. Former President Obama has sent veiled warnings about the consequences of bold action This exceptional moment demands examination and analysis. So the BBC is launching 100 Days, a daily programme that gives us the chance to look at these global shifts. In many ways, the inauguration of Donald Trump marks the beginning of the test of the populist experiment. Now he owns the problems he campaigned against. Can his bold approach work, who will benefit and who won't and how will he engage with the rest of the world? Donald Trump's life story Trump and Obama: Two characters in search of a legacy Can the president deliver on his promises? Trump's economic plans: What we know so far Every day for the next 100 days, with Christian Fraser in London and me in Washington, we will try to answer those questions. As he left office, President Obama had a veiled warning for his successor - if you're going to try to change things and bring in bold ideas, make sure you're aware of the consequences. He also suggested that the weight of office would soon settle on Mr Trump's shoulders and cause him to look carefully and humbly at what he has taken on. Katty Kay and Christian Fraser will present 100 Days from Washington and London Mr Trump goes into the White House as the least popular incoming president on record. He won't like that. We know from his election campaign that he watches polls closely and however hard he tries to dismiss them as ""phony"" or ""lying,"" they matter to him. His low ratings today give him a powerful incentive to do better. That could mean a combination of both working on his tone (something which appears to be unpopular with large sections of the American public) and pushing hard with his agenda (much of which also seems to be popular with many Americans). That too, will make this a fascinating time. Some of this is under Mr Trump's control, but some of it is not. The Republican Party will have a big impact in making his first 100 days successful - they can boost his legislative agenda or kill it. The party owes Mr Trump a lot, he has just handed them Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court, that will win him a lot of favours. But many Conservatives do not agree with everything he wants to do and, if his poll numbers stay low, they will have less incentive to help him out. So we have a busy, fascinating few months ahead of us. This populist trend is global and the test starts now. Mr Trump wants to change the look, feel and smell of Washington. Funny that, so did Mr Obama eight years ago. 100 Days, presented by Katty Kay and Christian Fraser, Monday - Thursday at 19:00 GMT on BBC News Channel and BBC Fourand BBC World News at 19:00 GMT.

Trainspotting stars appear at premiere,"T2 stars Kelly Macdonald and Ewan McGregor at the Edinburgh premiere The cast of the Trainspotting sequel have gathered in Edinburgh for the film's world premiere. Original cast members Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner all feature in T2 Trainspotting. The sequel has been made 21 years after the first film, which followed the lives of a group of heroin addicts. The original was based on a novel by Irvine Welsh, and the sequel is based on his book Porno. Robert Carlyle reprises his role as Begbie Ewen Bremner is back as Spud in T2 Trainspotting The new film sees the central characters in the present day, now middle-aged. Ewan McGregor and Kelly Macdonald were among the stars at the premiere at Cineworld in Edinburgh's Fountain Park. McGregor described how his initial reservations about making a sequel were soon dispelled. He said: ""I think we were all a little nervous about making a sequel to Trainspotting and not pulling it off, damaging the reputation or leaving a stale taste in people's mouths about the original film. ""But we only felt like that until we read John Hodge's script. ""We all feel like these are people we know - Renton and Spud and Begbie. It's amazing to step back into their shoes, and to hear their voices again is very special."" The trailer for the sequel was released in November. It opened with Ewan McGregor's character Renton returning to Edinburgh. This video can not be played Director Danny Boyle: ""It felt like we should make it in Edinburgh ... these stories belong here."" He revives his bitter ""choose life"" motto which has been updated to: ""Choose Facebook, choose Twitter, choose Instagram and hope that someone, somewhere, cares"". It also mentions choosing ""reality TV, slut-shaming, revenge porn and zero-hour contracts"" before saying: ""Choose to smother the pain with an unknown dose of an unknown drug."" Danny Boyle on set with Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner Much of the filming for the sequel, with director Danny Boyle, took place in Edinburgh and other Scottish locations in 2016. Boyle was a young aspiring film maker when he made the original Trainspotting. He has since won an Oscar and worked on the Olympic opening ceremony in London. He said: ""For all of us this town, these stories have been fundamental in shaping our careers. If you are seriously trying to do it again, you have to do it really properly at the beginning and at the end. Robert Carlyle on the orange carpet with author Irvine Welsh in the foreground ""At the beginning it was to come to Edinburgh - the last one was made in Glasgow mostly for financial reasons - we didn't have any money then and now we've got a bit more we thought we should make it in Edinburgh. ""And then we thought we should end it by having the premiere here as well."" T2 Trainspotting will be released in UK cinemas on 27 January.

Thanks Bill,"It took Andy Kuper a year and a half before he secured any investment for his company If you are going to get someone famous to launch your global business officially, it is hard to do better than President Bill Clinton. Yet as Andy Kuper will attest, it can be a nerve-racking experience. Back in September 2008, President Clinton was so impressed with Andy's new company, Leapfrog Investments, that he decided he would unveil it during his keynote speech at the annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative foundation. It meant that President Clinton would invite the then 33-year-old Andy on to the stage to speak to the few hundred attendees at the event in New York. Andy says: ""I had done a lot of public speaking before, but this was a rock 'n' roll thing. I was worried about stumbling on the stairs and falling on the president."" Thankfully for Andy, he managed to stay on his feet and give a speech that wasn't too overshadowed by President Clinton's well-known oratorical talents. Andy says: ""President Clinton was amazing, he is an incredible public speaker, I owe him a great deal."" Clinton brought Andy Kuper to wider attention But why was President Clinton so impressed with a South African businessman he had only recently met? Andy had ambitious plans to help transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, to help pull them out of poverty. Instead of giving them aid, his plan was to invest in, help run and expand indigenous companies, mostly insurance and healthcare funds, so that populations would not be blighted by ill-health. And instead of being a charity or non-profit organisation, Leapfrog planned to be very much profit-making and offer its investors a decent rate of return. The idea was to make globalisation and capitalism work for the world's poorest people. After a very slow start, the business today has more than $1bn (Â£800m) of funds on its books. It currently invests in 16 companies across 22 countries in Africa and Asia that have a combined 100,000 employees and serve 91 million people. The son of anti-apartheid campaigners and brought up on a farm outside of Johannesburg, Andy doesn't seem qualified to run a global investment firm on first glance at his CV. He has no business qualifications and instead studied philosophy at university, before going on to lecture in the subject. Leapfrog typically invests in insurance and healthcare firms across Africa and Asia Yet he started investing in the stock market aged 10, using money he made from selling the family's crops on the side of the road. By aged 13, he was making money for clients. After attending the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Andy went to Cambridge University. It was while at Cambridge that Andy spent a summer working for a non-government organisation in India, which he said was ""one of his most formative experiences"" and is the genesis of his future idea for Leapfrog. ""We were trying to get Indian farmers to adopt drip irrigation, which could triple their production and lift them out of poverty,"" says Andy, now 41. ""But they just wouldn't do it. At the time, I thought they were being so irrational, but they weren't - they weren't prepared to take the risk of doing something new and seeing their crops fail as a result. Why? Because this would have meant that their children starved. ""So I thought, why don't we give these people a safety net to enable them to take a chance on bettering themselves, such as insurance cover."" After spending his 20s lecturing and heading up an organisation that supports social entrepreneurs, Andy started work on Leapfrog. Initially, he got nowhere fast, because, he says, the idea was so new. Most Leapfrog firms, such as insurer Bima, utilise mobile technology He says: ""It seemed close to impossible to begin with, but I just believed so fundamentally in the idea, which I call profit with purpose, of investing in companies that serve the other half of humanity - the four billion people that conventionally have not been served."" With no money coming in, Andy had to live off his and his wife's savings until Leapfrog got its first small investment after a year and a half. The Clinton connection then followed, thanks to Andy knowing someone who worked for the organisation. However, the president's September 2008 speech failed to immediately open the investment floodgates, because it was quickly overshadowed by global events. A week later, investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the world was plunged into the global financial crisis. Andy now gives regular talks explaining Leapfrog's business model Yet despite this backdrop, Leapfrog was able to secure $135m of investment by late 2009. Today its institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Axa, JP Morgan, AIG, Swiss Re and the European Investment Bank. Companies that Leapfrog invests in and helps run include All Life, a South African insurance firm that gives low cost cover to people with HIV, Kenyan pharmacy chain Goodlife, and India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers. Andy says that Leapfrog helps the firms see revenues grow by an average 43% per year. Robert van Zwieten, president of Emerging Market Private Equity Association, the trade group for firms that invest in the developing world, says that Andy and Leapfrog have been ""trailblazers"" in helping to create a new industry known as ""impact investing"". These are firms that invest both to make money and to achieve a positive social impact. Leapfrog companies have 91 million customers in total He adds: ""The annual World Economic Forum (WEF) event at Davos has for several years been struggling to work out how to make globalisation and capitalism work for the many and not just the few, but Andy and his team at Leapfrog are already doing just that."" Now based in Sydney, Australia, after previously being in New York, Andy says: ""You can do more good if you are profitable, and make more profit because you are good [doing virtuous things].""

Gator aid,"Christy Kroboth gave up her career as a dental nurse to focus on animals with a lot more teeth - alligators. When she started training as an alligator catcher she was the only woman in her class, but - as she describes here - that made her even more determined to show she could jump on an animal many times her size, and tape its jaws tightly shut. When I first got my licence I was only doing this as a hobby, I'd go to work as a dental assistant and catch my alligators on the side. But I got well known for taking the alligators alive, and I'm now doing this as my full time job. I've been a true animal lover all my life. I blame it on my mom. When we were little she was the one that would stop the car, pull over, and help turtles and ducks cross the road. We took in all the strays - cats, dogs, whatever needed a home. Where I live in the south part of Texas we have a lot of alligators and there are these big master-plan communities that have manmade ponds and these ponds have alligators in them. The homeowners are so afraid that they're going to eat their kids and that they're going to eat their dogs, but in the past 100 years we've only had one person killed by an alligator, so it's all just superstition. These alligators have been around since the dinosaurs. They're great for the ecosystem, they keep all the aquatic life in check. They're actually really shy animals and they don't want to hurt anybody. But people think of these guys as monsters. They have this vision in their head, and when I noticed this I thought, ""What can I do to help change people's mindset?"" After reports that golfers were being mean to this giant alligator, Kroboth was called in to safely remove it from a Texan golf course You can't just go out and catch an alligator because alligators are protected by the state here in Texas. You have to have a special licence and a permit. I registered to be an alligator hunter with Texas Parks and Wildlife and we had to go through a whole training course. I was the only girl in the class and also the youngest. We had to go through the rules, laws and regulations, and then the trainer told us: ""OK, you've all passed the paperwork, now let's go do this hands-on."" I'd never even touched an alligator before and for a split second I thought, ""I can't do this."" I called my mom and I said, ""Mom, I can't do this!"" And, of course, mom is like, ""Come home right now, don't do it!"" But something told me: ""I have to do this - not only for the alligators, but to prove to these big ol' country boys that I can."" I ran out to the pond, got the alligator, taped him up and ended up passing the test. It was one of the happiest moments of my life and that adrenaline rush lasted the whole day. Listen to Christy Krobothspeaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories The biggest alligator I've ever caught was a 13ft (4m) male weighing more than 900lb (408kg). I'm 120lb (54kg), so he outweighed me by a good amount. He was blind and lost in a parking lot and could not find his way back to the water. Usually we catch alligators by grabbing their jaws with both hands. Once you feel comfortable enough you let go with one hand and you reach the other hand into your pocket, grab your electrical [insulating] tape and tape his mouth shut. You've got to move fast. Well, this alligator was so big that my hands would not fit around his jaws. I was trying to call my buddies to help, but it was six o'clock in the morning and none of my volunteers were answering. I was able to sucker one of the local cops into trying to help me, but he didn't want to put his hands around the alligator's mouth, which is understandable. Another way to catch an alligator is to try to outweigh them by jumping on their back, so I talked this poor cop into jumping on to the back of this alligator with me. The trick is you put all your weight down and sit completely down on the alligator. Well, the officer didn't and he kind of just danced around the alligator which any untrained person probably would. The alligator didn't like that, so he started wiggling around, trying to get away. I knew instantly this was not going to work, so I stood up to back off and the alligator swatted me with his tail and made me fall on my bottom right there beside his un-taped mouth. This video can not be played Christy Kroboth and police officer in action in the car park We were all worn out from trying to catch this alligator for four hours, the parking lot was getting busy and stores were starting to open so I had to make the decision to call in a game warden. I got very sad because game wardens usually don't come out and catch alligators, game wardens usually come out and kill alligators. I went to my car and I started crying because I'd been defeated by this animal. I called the game warden and he said, ""Christy, stop crying. I am going to come help you. Do not touch that alligator until I get there."" Well, when he said that I just got so much energy, I was so happy. I got out of my car like I could just conquer the world because somebody was coming to help me. Somehow I was able to go up to the alligator and hold his jaws in my arm and tape his mouth shut with my right hand. We ran to Home Depot and got zip ties to tie the alligator's hands behind his back like he was in handcuffs so he couldn't walk off. Then the game warden showed up and he said, ""I told you not to catch him!"" I said, ""I'm sorry, I just had all this confidence and I was able to do it!"" We had to borrow a forklift to pick the alligator up and load him in to my buddy's truck, because he was so big. Potentially dangerous alligators that cannot be released back into the wild are taken to a farm with tons of acreage and tons of ponds. But if the alligator can be released in the wild we have certain release sites where we can drop them off. Has inhabited North American wetlands for more than eight million years Feeds on fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals Average weight 790lb (360kg) - average length 13.1ft (4m) I have an SUV and sometimes the smaller alligators will want to climb over the seats and try to make their way to the front to help me drive, so it's me and the alligator waving at people going down the freeways. I've found out if you make it freezing cold in your car the alligators are calmer. So although it's the middle of summertime here in Houston - 97F (36C), humidity - I'm on the freeway in a jacket with gloves and a scarf and a blanket wrapped around me because my car is freezing cold. But the alligator is behaving, so that's all that matters. Sometimes they go to the bathroom, and alligator poo is not that great, so we'll have to roll down the windows and travel on down the road. Being the animal lover I am I think it's very important that we educate everybody on the animals that are living in their backyards and help them understand that we can all live together. I have three educational alligators, their names are Cam, Taylor and Halo. We call them our ""edugators"" because we take them to schools and we teach people alligator safety and alligator education. I work with these alligators every single day, they're used to being handled so they don't see us as a threat. They'll even sit on the couch and watch TV with me when they're not in their enclosures. When I go out on a catch sometimes there's a very afraid person there whose mindset is changed. They may say, ""Oh, I understand his importance now, I like him, let's name him."" When I see that change in people that's what really drives me to do what I do. That's why I wake up and why I do my job every single day.

Rocking the warehouse,"This video can not be played How GreyOrange is becoming India's home-grown robotics giant In 2008, engineering student Samay Kohli wanted to build a humanoid robot, but his professor told him it would not be possible. Along with his fellow student Akash Gupta, not only did they achieve that task, but they have also built GreyOrange, a multi-national robotics company based in India and operating across Asia. ""We've done some stuff that India was not supposed to do,"" Mr Kohli told the BBC. ""People are not supposed to build hardware, robot products, out of India and we've been able to do that."" Acyut was India's first home-grown humanoid robot and the first robot the team behind GreyOrange built So how did GreyOrange grow from an engineering classroom to an international robotics player? Mr Kohli and Mr Gupta proved their teacher wrong, building India's first humanoid robot, which they called Acyut. They then entered their creation in kung fu competitions and international robot football championships. The team also won several robotic competitions around the world. But it was a different passion that has seen GreyOrange grow - not for sport, but for online shopping. India's online shopping boom is driving massive international investment in the country's e-commerce sector The e-commerce sector in India has seen unprecedented growth in the last few years. Roughly 350 million Indian citizens are online and according to international payment company Worldpay, that will nearly double by 2020, when they will spend $63.7bn  (Â£51.8bn) online. Despite companies often making a loss as they offer deeper and deeper discounts to attract customers, investors have flooded into the sector. More than $5bn (Â£4bn) of private investment was ploughed into the sector in 2015, according to global consultancy PwC. Amazon recently announced it would invest an additional $3bn in India, on top of the $2bn it announced in 2014. While online retailing is only a part of e-commerce, it is the area that many see as the one with the biggest growth potential. Those retailers servicing millions of consumers will need to keep their goods in warehouses, and those warehouses need to be efficient. That's where GreyOrange has positioned itself. In India, GreyOrange says it has 90% of the warehouse automation market and it has worked with leading e-commerce and logistics firms in the country. They also run eight offices in five countries and employ more than 650 people. GreyOrange claims AI robot Butler can make a warehouse up to five times more efficient ""Warehouses are everywhere and they are supposed to become more and more intelligent as consumer demand increases.'' says Mr Kohli. GreyOrange has two different robots to help warehouses become more productive. Butler, an artificial intelligence-powered robotic system, helps pick products from shelves in the warehouse. ''A single person would pick about 100 to 120 items in one hour. With our Butler robot, he is able to pick 400 to 500 items every hour."" Mr Kohli says. The second robot, Sorter, automates the sorting of outgoing packages in a distribution centre. They say that the robots they already have installed can potentially sort three million packages every day. Samay Kohli (left) and Akash Gupta are the founders of GreyOrange One of the biggest challenges to the company's success has been sourcing parts. ''India does not have a very strong hardware ecosystem."" explains Paula Mariwala, who invests in technology based start-ups for SeedFund. ""So to source the right products and to get manufacturing going at a large scale in the early stages is particularly difficult. You would not be able to try out different components to have different versions of the product very easily - your time cycles will be longer. '' The size of the potential prize is what has helped the founders overcome these problems. ''We were looking at how robots are going to be the next revolution that is coming right, the next decade is going to be all about making humans more efficient by using robots more and that's essentially how we got started.'' Mr Kohli says. ''Robots are needed to work with humans and not to replace them. Humans will always be there in the workplace, but robots make a very important part of the ecosystem they work with. ""Ten years ago, every person did not have a computer, today every person has one computer. We look at robots in that sense: as everyone has one computer, in the future they will have one robot with them to help them do their work better. ""It's a trillion-dollar opportunity, that's the space we're fighting in.

Garth Crooks' team of the week,"Chelsea beat struggling Hull 2-0 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points. Arsenal were the only other team in the top six to win, beating Burnley 2-1. Manchester City and Tottenham drew 2-2 on Saturday, while Wayne Rooney scored a record 250th Manchester United goal as they rescued a point at Stoke. Elsewhere, there were wins for Southampton against Leicester, Swansea against Liverpool, Everton at Crystal Palace, West Ham at Middlesbrough and West Brom against Sunderland. Bournemouth and Watford drew. Do you agree with my team of the week or would you go for a different team? Why not pick your very own team of the week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends? Petr Cech made more saves than any other keeper on a winning side in the Premier League this weekend (six) I was tempted to go for Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois for another clean sheet. His save from Hull's Oumar Niasse in the closing minutes nearly clinched it, but I have gone for Petr Cech. The former Chelsea keeper was first class throughout the messy affair. He took a blow to the head that caused a moment's concern but recovered to put in a solid performance against a very dangerous Burnley. You can count on Cech to be professional in a crisis and there were times in this match when Arsenal seemed to be out of control. The behaviour of Arsene Wenger was jaw-dropping. To push the fourth official, who was well within his rights to ask Wenger to leave the area having been dismissed, was appalling. It's just as well the Arsenal manager has apologised to him, it's the least he could do. Now he will have to wait to hear what the FA thought about this unseemly affair. I suspect it won't be good. Only Gareth Barry (three) created more chances for Everton against Palace than Coleman (two) What a finish by Seamus Coleman. If there is one full-back you want the ball to drop to in the opposition's penalty area minutes from time then Coleman's the man. Palace can moan all they want about Jeffrey Schlupp requiring treatment for cramp. The referee is under no obligation to stop the match unless he considers the matter serious. For Everton - and Coleman in particular - to take advantage of Palace's misfortune is precisely what the game is all about. To be perfectly honest, Coleman was superb all afternoon. He was a constant menace down Crystal Palace's left side and caused all sorts of problems for the Eagles. Time is running out for Sam Allardyce. Having suffered that earth-shattering experience of losing the England job in such an undignified fashion, I wondered if it has destroyed what has hitherto been an impregnable confidence? I hope not because Palace are going to need it. Shkodran Mustafi won more aerial duels than any other Premier League defender this weekend (nine) Trying to win a football match with 10 men is one thing - but it becomes considerably more difficult when your manager and team-mates seem to have lost the plot while you are trying to do it. That's what appeared to be the situation facing Shkodran Mustafi in a mad spell at Emirates Stadium. It all started when Granit Xhaka made a totally outrageous tackle on Steven Defour, followed by an equally needless challenge by Francis Coquelin that resulted in a penalty. The madness didn't stop there either; Arsene Wenger was then removed from the dugout for remonstrating about a decision the referee Jon Moss got absolutely right. Fortunately, Mustafi kept his cool at a time when all around him were losing theirs. Gary Cahill scored his 10th Premier League goal for Chelsea - the sixth defender to do so (Terry, Ivanovic, Petrescu, Leboeuf and Gallas) This was not an easy game for Chelsea or Gary Cahill but they both got through it. The Chelsea captain suffered a nasty bang on the head having clashed with Ryan Mason. Mason never recovered and went straight to hospital, while Cahill went on to score the goal that sealed a difficult victory. The Blues have now stretched their lead at the top of the table, having kept their discipline and their composure. Notably, we saw the return of Diego Costa from the naughty corner, adding his goalscoring talents to the side. No doubt Cahill read Costa the riot act on behalf of the players and dressing room order seems to have been restored. Now they go to Liverpool in two weeks' time with an opportunity to put this title race beyond the Merseysiders. It's amazing what a team can achieve with discipline, talent and composure. As well as scoring, Chris Brunt made more tackles (five) and played more passes (48) than any West Brom player against Sunderland What a strike by Chris Brunt. We know the Northern Irishman can whack a ball, but his goal against Sunderland was so sweetly struck that it was an object of sheer beauty. What was not so pretty was the altercation between Darren Fletcher and Papy Djilobodji when the Senegal defender appeared to shove the West Brom captain in the face. Based on the evidence, no punches were thrown - but hands were certainly raised. Why West Brom manager Tony Pulis, in his post-match interview, devolved his 'opinion' to the MOTD studio on this specific matter I don't really understand. Managers can seriously defend a player's actions or condemn them - Pulis elected to do neither. I hope we are not coming into a period in the game where managers (Pep Guardiola included) no longer think it their job to express an opinion. However, there was one thing we all agreed on: Brunt's goal was a cracker. Alexis Sanchez scored his first Premier League penalty at this third attempt The penalty that settled this fixture was controversial but it took a big man to convert it. Once I saw Alexis Sanchez step up to the spot I knew the game was over. The fact Jon Moss got the decision wrong in my view is immaterial now, but what did the referee think Ben Mee was going to do, let Laurent Koscielny head the ball into the back of the net? The defender is entitled to clear the ball regardless of where the opposing player is prepared to stick his head. Nevertheless, the penalty was awarded and Sanchez showed his class with a coolly taken spot-kick in a white hot atmosphere. It's just as well Arsenal have a player who in this sort of situation can cope with the pressure. Tom Carroll made one cross against Liverpool - it was the assist for Fernando Llorente's second goal The former Tottenham midfielder gave Liverpool fair warning early in the first half when he hit the woodwork. However, it was the way this young talent seemed to run the show that impressed me. He spent long periods dictating the play - irrespective of the presence of Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum - and did so with real purpose. Swansea's first league win at Anfield was masterminded by a 24-year-old who did not have much Premier League experience. Last week, we saw Liverpool defend heroically at Old Trafford - but courage alone is not enough. Liverpool need know-how and a central defender who can organise and marshal his defensive colleagues in isolation and one that doesn't need the assistance of the cavalry every time there is a set-piece or counter-attack. The Reds now have to face Chelsea, Spurs and Arsenal at Anfield in a matter of weeks. I keep saying that Liverpool can't win the title with this defence, but it's obvious Jurgen Klopp disagrees. Wayne Rooney became Manchester United's all-time highest goalscorer (250), as well as the Premier League's all-time top away goalscorer (88) with his goal against Stoke He's only gone and done it. Wayne Rooney has broken Sir Bobby Charlton's record and Bobby was there to see it. 250 not out. It was a landmark goal by the best team player of his generation. Rooney was so consumed in his post-match interview by the fact that Manchester United had salvaged a point in such difficult circumstances that his record-breaking exploit had become secondary. This typified a player who I have grown to greatly respect over the years. He never misses an England match if called upon and plays for his club in any position when required. Rooney stood up to Sir Alex Ferguson (and quite rightly) when he felt his manager wasn't buying the players befitting of Manchester United, prolonged David Moyes' tenure at the club with virtuoso performances having been told he was surplus to requirements - and now sits on the bench without a moment's fuss or hesitation under Jose Mourinho, waiting to come to the rescue if needed. This is a player who deserves all the plaudits. After all, he's earned them. James Ward Prowse ended a run of 21 games without a goal in all competitions for Southampton This was a game in which Leicester City were unrecognisable from the side who won the Premier League title. Admittedly, Southampton and James Ward-Prowse in particular contributed to their demise, but I must say the Foxes are playing with fire. Better teams than them have gone down and Claudio Ranieri had better pull his finger out. In the meantime, Southampton have worked their way through a very difficult period and as a result unearthed a new Morgan Schneiderlin. Every time I see Ward-Prowse play, he gets better and better and he was the architect of Leicester's downfall. That said, if Leicester are serious about staying in the Premier League, they should seriously consider how they manage their Champions League fixtures because they can't succeed in both. Andy Carroll scored a double in a Premier League away game for the first time Crisis, what crisis?  I said last week if Andy Carroll can stay fit between now and the end of the season, Dimitri Payet can take a running jump. In fact, I will drive him to Marseille myself. The former Liverpool and Newcastle striker looks in great form at the moment and destroyed Middlesbrough, who seem to be punching above their weight. I have an enormous amount of time for manager Aitor Karanka's team, who remind me a bit of Jack Charlton's Boro in the 70s. There wasn't a great deal of stardom in that side either but tremendous endeavour. Unfortunately, against a rampant West Ham led by Carroll, effort wasn't enough. Six of Llorente's eight Premier League goals have come as part of a double I just didn't see this result coming and that's why you can't take your eyes off the Premier League for a moment. Swansea may have the worst defensive record in the division but that didn't mean a row of beans to the Swans on the day. Llorente's first goal was an opportunist's toe-poke, but his second was superb. The way he attacked the ball was brave and full of intent and gave Swansea what they deserved. Liverpool still find themselves in a fantastic position regardless of this result - but a wonderful opportunity will soon evaporate if they don't fix what has been glaringly obvious to me all season. Liverpool need a central defensive general.

Can F1 be liberated from 'dysfunction'?,"Liberty Media chairman Chase Carey chats to F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone Formula 1 is about to be under new ownership - and it could lead to profound changes in the sport. US group Liberty Media is poised tocomplete its takeoverof the commercial side of F1, possibly as early as this week, and has big plans to grow the sport in a number of areas. At the same time, it has problems to sort out. The man picked by Liberty as F1's chairman - former Rupert Murdoch lieutenant Chase Carey - has been told in meetings with senior figures over the past few months that F1 is ""dysfunctional"" at present. So what is around the corner in this brave new world? If they were not before the deal was made, Liberty are well aware now that the sport they are taking over could be in better condition. Carey has been publicly quiet since Liberty bought the first tranche of its shareholding in September, but he has spent the time getting to know what the company that employed him has bought. His findings were: The revenue system is skewed in favour of the already rich and powerful, to the extent that the smallest teams are struggling to survive and money is tight for about half the grid. There is a lack of competition on track. Television audience figures are dropping in many markets - although this is largely because of a switch to pay television, to make more money from TV rights deals. The longest-standing races are struggling to fund themselves and risk dropping off the calendar The decision-making process is not working properly. Some significant business and sporting decisions have been made for solely financial reasons, disregarding other important factors, such as their effects on the sporting side. An acceptance that F1 has lost some of its appeal, particularly a sense of edge and drama and as an extreme driver challenge. Liberty has decided to change much of that. The question is how. Many of those concerns can be laid at the door of F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone - it was he who set up the governance structure, brokered all the financial deals and signed another three-year contract with Pirelli as tyre supplier against the wishes of the drivers and a number of senior figures. Liberty had asked Ecclestone to stay on as chief executive officer under Carey, but for some time now the word inside F1 has been that the 86-year-oldwould be gone before longand on Monday he said he had been askedto step down from his positionand take on a new one as a kind of honorary president. It should be remembered that he is a fighter and a survivor and he has no desire to give up a business which he sees as his. And he has fought off at least one attempt by previous owners CVC Capital Partners to get rid of him. This video can not be played We'll make F1 bigger and better - Carey But, whether he likes it or not, he will be an employee and therefore subject to the whims and wishes of his bosses - now Carey and Liberty owner John Malone. Ecclestone has never really operated in such a situation before - by and large the previous owners, CVC, left him to his own devices. He likes to do things his way, and he is not one to enjoy outside interference. Ecclestone's approach to business is adversarial. His problem is that Liberty have decided that they are going to run the business in a different way from now on - a more collegiate approach. He will either accept that and operate accordingly, or he won't be working there much longer. It's hard to see how he could adapt to that way of working - or even want to. And senior sources in F1 say they believe that even if he does not go this week, they expect his departure to happen within a month. Whether he stays or not, changes will be made to the business structure. Liberty will employ two people to head up the different branches of the sport and oversee changes - commercial on the one hand; sporting and technical on the other. Ex-ESPN marketing chief Sean Bratches has been given the commercial role, and former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn the other. The history of F1 over the last decade or so has been the decline of the number of races in Europe, and the struggles of many of those remaining to meet Ecclestone's increasingly high demands for race fees. Germany does not have a race this year, and its contract ends after next year's grand prix in Hockenheim. Italy struck a new three-year deal at the 11th hour this winter. Silverstone is reluctantly toying with the idea of ending its contract after 2019 if it cannot renegotiate terms. Through all this, Ecclestone has acted as if he does not care - if a race in Europe won't pay the fees he wants, he has usually said, he'll find one elsewhere. There's usually a controversial regime wanting to stump up a wad of cash to host an F1 race. Liberty want to end this. They see the historic European races - Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, for example - as a key aspect of F1 and one they have to nurture and cherish. They recognise that Europe is F1's core market, where most of its TV audience is, and they want the races there to be the centrepiece of the 'new F1', one that has a visible link to a heritage it treasures. Liberty Media want to protect F1's historic European races, like the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Ecclestone's ethos has been to take F1 to any country that wants it and has a large enough chequebook to fund it. His eye has been on the deal itself - and not on its wider consequences on F1. This is how F1 has ended up with races in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, countries with controversial records on human rights, and how Ecclestone has found himself for the last three years sitting next to Vladimir Putin at the Russian Grand Prix. All three countries pay astronomical fees for their races - Russia $50m year; Azerbaijan a reputed $75m, for example. Liberty wants to take a different approach. For them, deals based solely on the bottom line and nothing else are not necessarily the right deals. They want to expand F1 - but they want new races to be held in the right places and for the right reasons. And they are prepared to invest to make it happen. This is a massive shift from Ecclestone's approach. The idea of spending money now to earn more later has largely been anathema to Ecclestone. Some argue it has been one of the reasons why he struggled for so long to establish a race in the USA until Austin, Texas, came along. Liberty are open about wanting races in New York and Los Angeles - or near enough to be easily identified as such - and are prepared to put down their own money to make it happen. They have also talked about more races in Latin America and Asia. Liberty are in favour of introducing a race in or around New York - something that has always been discussed, but never seemed likely under Ecclestone Carey has been clear that he sees the opportunity to expand the business ""in all areas"", but the one where there is most room for improvement is in exploiting the internet. Ecclestone has made no secret of the fact that he does not really get social media, nor see any opportunity to monetise it. Younger people in F1 have grown frustrated with this, and realise that there are any number of things that could be done. But, aware that rare has been the person who has crossed Ecclestone without consequence, they have in recent years kept their counsel and waited for a change to happen. Liberty are clear that this is an area where they see vast potential, and it's quite conceivable that, over time, the entire business model of F1 will change as a result. Right now, F1 is sold as a whole package to one or sometimes two TV stations in a country. But insiders see the opportunity to sell it piecemeal through the internet, with varying degrees of access for varying amounts of money. How Formula 1 is sold as a TV package could change drastically Promotionally, too, there is a lot of room to make gains. Ecclestone is called the ""promoter"". But many argue that's a misnomer - in that he doesn't really do any promoting at all. Arrive in any city or country hosting a grand prix and it is often hard to tell there is an event going on. Many races are not sold out - but how are people who might have a passing interest in going expected to know when that opportunity exists without them being advertised effectively? Liberty are talking about having ""20 Super Bowls"". By which they don't mean an Americanisation of the event - but of making a bigger deal of the event itself wherever it is being held. Build it up in the week before the race with various promotional activities and so on. Many F1 insiders recognise that in recent years the sport has lost its way a little. It remains the arena where the best drivers in the world race in the fastest cars, but its edginess has been dulled. The risk and challenge are still there - but less apparent. Liberty are keen to get this back. This year'snew rules- decided upon long before Liberty was involved - are a first step in that direction, with wider, more dramatic-looking cars expected to lap up to five seconds faster and provide a more extreme physical challenge for the drivers. But the jury is still out as to whether this will work. Faster, more physically demanding, cars are on their way No-one doubts the cars will be dramatically faster. The question is whether Pirelli has managed to build the more durable tyres that have been demanded to go with them. F1 bosses have drawn up a set of requirements for Pirelli that they expect to lead to tyres on which drivers can push flat out most of the time - which has simply not been possible since 2011 because the tyres have been too fragile. If this has not happened, it will turn out to have been rather pointless to make faster cars because the drivers will not be able to use all their potential. Liberty - having taken over the contract Ecclestone struck with Pirelli - have been made aware of these issues and will be watching closely. Another area which may come under scrutiny is driver head protection. Governing body the FIA has been working hard on the 'halo' device which protects drivers from heavy flying debris. It is planned for introduction in 2018. But while the vast majority of drivers are in favour of it, the FIA has recently said its introduction depends on a philosophicaldiscussion about aestheticsand the nature of F1. The halo could yet be abandoned if it is considered contrary to the ethos of open-wheel, open-cockpit racing - although the drivers may fight against this. Everything is up for discussion - even the format of the race weekend itself. But Liberty wants to take an inclusive approach to any change, rather than the imposition Ecclestone has tended to pursue. It is easy to see problems with some of Liberty's plans. For one thing, they - like any other business - are in this to make money. And if they are going to make the European races more affordable for promoters and spend money establishing new ones in America, they are going to affect the bottom line, at least in the short term. But they seem deadly serious about it. Raw power: will Ferrari keep the $100m dollars they receive every year from F1 just for taking part? Equally, there are unlikely to be big changes immediately. Although Carey has been working hard for months, it will take time for Liberty to fully understand the business, and even longer to make some of the changes needed to its structures. The immediate concern will be to tie the teams down to new contracts - those of everyone bar Renault end in 2020 - and with them, presumably, a changed prize money structure. That in itself won't be easy - how will Ferrari react, for example, if they are told they cannot keep all of the $100m payment they currently receive just for being Ferrari? Change is definitely coming, though. Be in no doubt about that.

Scientists consider fake news 'vaccine',"The appearance of fake news on websites and social media has inspired scientists to develop a ""vaccine"" to immunise people against the problem. A University of Cambridge study devised psychological tools to target fact distortion. Researchers suggest ""pre-emptively exposing"" readers to a small ""dose"" of the misinformation can help organisations cancel out bogus claims. Stories on the US election and Syria are among those to have caused concern. ""Misinformation can be sticky, spreading and replicating like a virus,"" said the University of Cambridge study's lead author Dr Sander van der Linden. ""The idea is to provide a cognitive repertoire that helps build up resistance to misinformation, so the next time people come across it they are less susceptible."" The study, published in the journalGlobal Challenges,external, was conducted as a disguised experiment. More than 2,000 US residents were presented with two claims about global warming. The researchers say when presented consecutively, the influence well-established facts had on people were cancelled out by bogus claims made by campaigners. But when information was combined with misinformation, in the form of a warning, the fake news had less resonance. Fabricated stories alleging the Pope was backing Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton sold weapons to the so-called Islamic State group were read and shared by millions of Facebook users during the US election campaign. The world's largest social networklater announced new featuresto help combat fabricated news stories, and there is pressure on Google and Twitter to do more to tackle the issue. Meanwhile,German officials have reportedly proposed creating a special government unitto combat fake news in the run-up to this year's general election, whilea senior Labour MP only last week warnedthat British politics risks being ""infected by the contagion"". The deliberate making up of news stories to fool or entertain is nothing new. But the arrival of social media has meant real and fictional stories are now presented in such a similar way that it can sometimes be difficult to tell the two apart. There are hundreds of fake news websites out there, from those which deliberately imitate real life newspapers, to government propaganda sites, and even those which tread the line between satire and plain misinformation, sometimes employed to suit political ends.

"What is Acrylamide, and should we give up toast?","Roast potatoes with roast chicken - a thing of the past? Advice on how to reduce the amount of acrylamide in our diets has been issued by the government's food safety body, because the chemical could cause cancer. Acrylamide is created when starchy foods are roasted, grilled or fried for long periods at high temperatures. The message is to cut back on browned and burnt toast, cook roast potatoes, chips and parsnips carefully - to a golden yellow colour - and eat fewer crisps, cakes and biscuits. Are they trying to take all the fun out of life? We try to put the latest dietary advice from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) into perspective. Do not panic - you do not need to give up on the delicious Sunday roast staple just yet. Crispy, brown roast potatoes which are traditionally cooked at very high temperatures do produce acrylamide, but the key is to try to cook them to the right colour. ""Go for gold"" is what the FSA advises - that is a golden yellow colour, rather than brown. And that applies to parsnips and all types of potato products too. So if you are a roast potato fanatic you might want to rein in your obsession and cook them a little less often. If you love them at Christmas and special occasions in-between, then try turning down the oven heat and taking the roast potatoes out before they start to turn excessively crispy and brown. Well, during the browning process, when starchy foods are heated they do give off new flavours and aromas. The bad news is that the same process also produces acrylamide, so there may have to be some trade-off between tastiness and the colour of your food. When cooking packaged products, such as oven chips, follow the instructions carefully - they are designed to ensure you are not cooking starchy foods for too long or at too high a temperature. Boiling, steaming or microwaving food is a much better and healthier option. Five shades of toast: go for a golden yellow colour, say government food scientists There is no need to worry about the occasional slightly overcooked piece of toast or other food. Scraping off the dark brown bits of toast might help reduce acrylamide content a bit - and it certainly will not increase it. But, in general, aim for a golden or lighter colour (see above). Studies in animals found that the chemical causes tumours. This suggests that it also has the potential to cause cancer in humans. The FSA has used that data and multiple dietary surveys to work out whether an average person's exposure to acrylamide in food is a concern. Scientists believe that there should be a margin of exposure of 10,000 or higher between an average adult's intake of acrylamide and the lowest dose which could cause adverse effects. But at the moment the numbers are 425 for the average adult and 50 for the highest consuming toddlers, making it a slight public health concern, UK and European food safety experts say. However, Cambridge University risk expert Prof David Spiegelhalter is unconvinced by this very strict safety standard. He says the margin of exposure figure is ""arbitrary"" and 33 times higher than the current margin for average adults in the UK, and he questions whether a public campaign should be launched on that basis. Stopping smoking is the most important thing you can do to prevent cancer. Keeping a healthy bodyweight and eating a balanced diet ranks second. Our individual risk of cancer depends on a combination of genes, our environment and the lifestyle we lead, which we are able to control. The amount of acrylamide in our diets is one small element of our food intake which we can control to help reduce our risk of cancer during the whole of our lives. Research has shown that eating too much processed meat and red meat can increase the risk of developing cancer - that is a definite. Cooking meat at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing can produce cancer-causing chemicals called heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic amines (PCAs). This advice is another good reason to cut back on chips and eat a healthy, balanced diet The FSA says the industry is doing its bit to find out how to reduce levels of acrylamide in food. A toolkit and brochures have been produced for food manufacturers and food businesses, giving information and advice. Evidence suggests the industry has been lowering levels of acrylamide in food over the past few years. But there are currently no rules on the maximum limits for the chemical in food. It is their job to make sure the food we eat is safe and to let the public know if they are concerned about any risk to our health. This is not a new risk - people are likely to have been exposed to it since fire was first invented. A Swedish study in 2002 was the first to reveal that high levels of acrylamide formed during the baking or frying of potato and cereal products. And since then researchers have been trying to make sure the risks from the chemical are kept to a minimum. Infants and toddlers are more at risk of exposure because of their smaller body weight, and their high intake of cereal-based foods. Basically, the advice is another reason to eat a healthy, balanced diet - and make sure your children do too.

Home solutions,"This video can not be played New Nigerian homes are being built on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean Nigeria's largest city Lagos is facing a housing crisis. The BBC's Nancy Kacungira looks at how entrepreneurs are trying to solve the crisis. Affordable housing is a considerable challenge for urban areas with large populations, and this is particularly prevalent in the Nigeria's city of Lagos. More than 500,000 people move to the city every year, and across Nigeria, there is already a housing deficit of more than 17 million units. There are on-going projects of varying scale trying to address the shortage; one is reclaiming land from the Atlantic Ocean to build a new city suburb called Eko Atlantic on the shores of Victoria Island. Tonnes of sand and heavy rock were poured into the ocean to provide 10 sq km (3.8 sq miles) of land for shops, offices and homes. Protected by an 8km long sea wall, the city will have its own power and water supply, and even an independent road network. Developers say Eko Atlantic is aimed at those on a middle income Eko Atlantic will be able to accommodate more than 500,000 people, but the multibillion dollar project has been perceived as being ""only for the rich"". Ronald Chagoury Jr, one of the developers, says it is a perception they have been trying to shake off. ""From the beginning we always thought that this would be a city for the middle income. ""We know that the middle income has grown significantly in the past 15 years and we know that it is going to grow even more."" Still, some residents of Lagos feel that there are already many housing options - they just cannot afford them. Properties are pricey and landlords typically require annual, not monthly rent payments. Banking consultant Abimbola Agbalu tells me that he has to live at his grandmother's house, because renting his own place would be too expensive. Some housing projects remain unoccupied because they are pricey ""If I wanted to rent a house where I would prefer in Lagos I would be spending at least 80% of my pay cheque to move in because I would have to pay two years' rent upfront, agency fees and maintenance fees. ""And from then on I would have to spend another 60-70% of my pay cheque every year on rent, which doesn't make sense. ""The problem is not that there are no houses. If you look around, there are empty houses all over Lagos; some can even go a year without being rented out. ""The problem is that people can't afford them. We need better alternatives."" One Nigerian company is thinking inside the box in order to provide a cheaper housing option - by making homes out of cargo containers. Dele Ijaiya-Oladipo says he co-founded Tempohousing Nigeria to provide a creative solution in a city that desperately needs low-cost housing. Shipping containers are modified to make houses but Nigerians are not keen on them ""The only way we can get the housing deficit sorted is by providing good quality houses at affordable rates. ""You can't build a million homes at a price that no-one will ever afford - that doesn't achieve anything."" Mr Ijaiya-Oladipo's container homes are 25% cheaper than traditional housing, and can be built in as little as two weeks. ""But the concept is still foreign to many Nigerians; so most of his clients tend to use the containers to build office spaces, not homes,"" he says. ""Until a potential client actually sees our past work, they can't really picture how a shipping container can be used as a finished house or office. ""We have to encourage people to visit our office which is made out of containers, so they can see what we are talking about."" From a self-sustaining city to refurbished-shipping containers, private sector real-estate developers are offering both big and small solutions - and Lagos needs them all. The city is Africa's largest, and its population is expected to double by 2050; putting even more pressure on already limited housing options.

Cybercrime,"""Iâm not that stupid"" â¦ ""Itâll never happen to me"" ... ""I wouldnât fall for one"" ... â¦ thatâs what many of us think when we talk about falling victim to a scam.

Itâs unlikely youâd raise even an eyebrow to an email from Amazon popping up in your inbox, let alone any alarm bells, but you need to be alert. Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime reporting centre, says itâs received reports from victims who have been sent âconvincing-looking emailsâ claiming to be from Amazon. The email thanks you for your order, whether itâs a watch, an iPhone, an action figure or even a potty, and then goes on to say that if you havenât authorised the transaction you should click on a link to get a full refund. Thatâs where the problem starts. The link takes you to a very legitimate-looking website which asks for your name, address and bank card details. Hey presto â the scammers have got all they need to go on a spending spree. Amazon says, ""The best way to ensure that you do not respond to a false or phishing e-mail is to always go directly to your account on Amazon to review or make any changes to your orders or your account."" You can report a false or phishing email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com. There is also avideo,externalto help you identify whether an email is from Amazon. PayPal Itâs not the first and probably wonât be the last PayPal email scam. This one warns of ""unusual activity on your PayPal account"". It advises you to click on the link to ""resolve a limitation on your account"". It asks you to log into your account and confirm your details and security questions. By doing so, youâre handing over your personal details to scammers who can then go on and use them to their advantage, whether that's stealing your identity, spending your money or gaining passwords to your other accounts. Paypaloffers advice,externalon how to find out how to spot a fake email. But itâs not just emails that can catch you out. You need to keep your wits about you when you receive instant messages as well. WhatsApp Over one billion people use WhatsApp messenger service each month. Thatâs nearly one in seven people around the world using the app to chat with friends and family. For the scammers, itâs easy pickings. They only need to catch out a very small proportion of users to rake it in. One of the latest scams is offering Sainsburyâs gift cards. A victim receives a message that looks like itâs from a genuine contact in your phone, telling you that Sainsburyâs is giving away Â£100 gift cards to celebrate new stores opening. The link in the message looks real enough. But if you click on it you could end up downloading malware onto your phone, scammers could steal your personal details and your identity. A Sainsburyâs spokesperson said, âWe are aware of the issue and are advising customers to delete the message."" FollowWhatsAppâs advice,externalfor staying safe whilst using their messaging service Facebook Market Place In October last year, Facebook Marketplace was launched. It allows people to buy and sell items locally. However, unlike rival websites, there isnât a secure payment facility like PayPal, or any feedback systems in place. So, itâs up to buyers and sellers to agree on prices and payment methods. Action Fraud has received reports of victims asking to pay via PayPal but being met with a variety of excuses as to why they canât and the fraudster then asks them to pay by bank transfer. Victims transfer the money but donât receive the goods and have no way of getting in contact with the seller because their messages are blocked. ReadFacebook's advice,externalon how to report fraud. HM Revenue & Customs and iTunes vouchers This scam has been going a whileâ¦ but itâs still very much in play. Action Fraud has received hundreds of complaints about it. Unsuspecting victims are contacted via phone calls, text messages and emails from fraudsters claiming to be from HMRC. They are told they must pay off fake debts and taxes by using iTunes Gift Cards. The victim buys a gift card and hands over the 16-digit code on the back of the card to the fraudster during a phone call to pay off debts and tax. Fraudsters use iTunes Gift Cards to collect money from victims because they can be easily redeemed or sold on. The scammers donât need the actual physical card to buy goods. Apple says: ""If you're approached to use iTunes Gift Cards for payment outside of our official stores you could very likely be the target of a scam and should immediately report it to your local police station.â HereâsAppleâs advice,externalregarding the iTunes voucher and HMRC scam What do the experts say? Cyber security expert David McClelland says, ""Weâre all taught about 'stranger danger' when we grow up and really we need to develop this now to keep our guard up when opening emails and instant messaging conversation. We need to be less trusting. ""Itâs important to remember that scammers send out emails en masse. They donât know the names of people receiving them. Thatâs how good guys differentiate themselves from the bad guys. If a message or email starts with âHey memberâ or âHey [email address]â alarm bells should ring.
