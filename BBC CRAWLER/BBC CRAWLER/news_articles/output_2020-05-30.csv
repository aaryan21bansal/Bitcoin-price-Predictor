India to loosen lockdown despite record casesA plan to ease the world's biggest lockdown begins on 8 June with restaurants and malls re-opening.,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Death and despair for migrants on Indian roads India has announced plans to further ease a strict national lockdown even as the country reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases. From 8 June, restaurants, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship will be allowed to re-open in many areas in the first stage of a three-phase plan. Weeks later, probably in July, schools and colleges will resume teaching. But areas with high numbers of Covid-19 cases will remain under tight lockdown. The plan comes after India registered a new record single-day rise in confirmed infections, with nearly 8,000 cases reported on Saturday. In total India has recorded some 174,500 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. The nation of 1.3 billion has been hit less hard by the coronavirus than many other countries. Trouble ahead for India's fight against Covid-19 How Covid-19 has ravaged India's richest city It went into a strict lockdown more than two months ago when the confirmed caseload was in the hundreds. Official data suggests the decision prevented the loss of between 37,000 and 78,000 lives. However the cost to the economy has been high and pictures of millions of informal workers leaving cities for their rural villages after losing their jobs - some of them on foot - shocked the country. Health officials say that they are able to further lift the lockdown in many places because most cases have been restricted to urban areas in a handful of states. More than 80% of the active cases are in five states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh - and more than 60% of the cases are in five cities, including Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad, according to official data.

Microsoft 'to replace journalists with robots',"Microsoft is to replace dozens of contract journalists on its MSN website and use automated systems to select news stories, US and UK media report. The curating of  stories from news organisations and selection of headlines and pictures for the MSN site is currently done by  journalists. Artificial intelligence will perform these news production tasks, sources told theSeattle Times,external. Microsoft said it was part of an evaluation of its business. The US tech giant said in a statement: ""Like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis. This can result in increased investment in some places and, from time to time, redeployment in others. These decisions are not the result of the current pandemic."" Microsoft, like some other tech companies, pays news organisations to use their content on its website. But it employs journalists to decide which stories to display and how they are presented. Around 50 contract news producers will lose their jobs at the end of June, the Seattle Times reports, but a team of full-time journalists will remain. Google funds automated news project ""It's demoralising to think machines can replace us but there you go,"" one of those facing redundancy told the paper. Some  sacked journalists warned that artificial intelligence may not be fully familiar with strict editorial guidelines, and could end up letting through inappropriate stories. Twenty-seven of those losing their jobs are employed by the UK's PA Media,the Guardian reports,external. One journalist quoted in the paper said: ""I spend all my time reading about how automation and AI is going to take all our jobs - now it's taken mine."" Microsoft is one of many tech companies experimenting with forms of so-called robot journalism to cut costs.   Google is also investing in projects to understand how it might work.

Shielders in England to be allowed outdoors again,"Vulnerable people in England and Wales advised to stay home since the coronavirus lockdown began will be able to go outdoors again from Monday. The change means people will be able to go out with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Support for shielders, such as food and medicine deliveries, will continue. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. Who should be shielding? In England, those shielding will be advised that they can go outside once a day, with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance. In Wales, outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited. Those shielding should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. Around 2.5 million UK people were advised to stay at home as lockdown began, because they were identified as being at particularly high risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms. Most were notified by their GP. Thelist of people who should be shielding,externalincludes solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. Some people shielding to be allowed outdoors A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Not all elderly people were asked to shield. Some were later removed from the shielding listif they no longer met the requirements. One of the scientists advising the government, Professor Peter Openshaw, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that we are learning more about the virus: ""I think we're going to be able to fine-tune the advice now and actually reassure some people we feared might be susceptible, that in fact they're not as vulnerable as we thought."" This video can not be played Primary school teacher Lynne Loomes says she has felt ""guilty"" about not being able to go into work with her colleagues Lynne Loomes, a primary school teacher from Gloucestershire, is one of those who has had to stay inside having been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year. She told BBC Breakfast that the easing of lockdown measures has made shielding more challenging - especially since she has had to tell her children they cannot go out for socially-distanced meet ups with friends. ""I'm having to say 'no, you can't, because that increases the risk for me',"" she said. ""In terms of day-to-day we've tried to get up as normal. We've tried to keep the routine as if we were going to work,"" she added. ""But it has actually got harder as some of the rules have eased, because we know that it doesn't really change for us as a family."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that ""thousands of lives"" had been saved by those who had shielded themselves. Some scientists have expressed concerns about England's easing of lockdown rules whileinfection rates remain at around 8,000 per dayaccording the Office for National Statistics. ""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,""said Professor John Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine and one of the government's top advisors. ""Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England,"" tweeted Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the consensus among scientists was that the new measures were not expected to push the rate of infection above the key R value of 1.0. However, heurged the public to be ""sensible and proportionate with the freedomwe have wanted to give people"", saying the UK is ""at a dangerous moment"" and the easing of lockdown ""has to go slowly"". Reacting to the change, Phil Anderson from the MS Society said thousands of the more than 130,000 people with MS in the UK had been feeling ""forgotten"" after months of shielding. He said they were concerned the news had come ""out of the blue"" and extremely vulnerable people would want to hear ""a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"". He also called for better mental health support for everyone who needs it. BBC FOOD:Low calorie fakeaways BBC BITESIZE:How long to make a vaccine?

Private rocket takes astronauts to space station,"This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit. It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX. Live: Astronauts make history How we got to this point Evolution of the spacesuit Who are the astronauts? Key questions about the mission It was a triumphant day for Elon Musk and his SpaceX company It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters. Doug Hurley (L) and Bob Behnken (R) will be in space for up to four months The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. ""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil."" Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Behnken (far) and Hurley (near) called down to Earth at the end of the day's activities Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name."" Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. Crowds were asked to stay away but local beaches were still full The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX. Live: Astronauts make history How we got to this point Evolution of the spacesuit Who are the astronauts? Key questions about the mission It was a triumphant day for Elon Musk and his SpaceX company It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters. Doug Hurley (L) and Bob Behnken (R) will be in space for up to four months The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. ""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil."" Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Behnken (far) and Hurley (near) called down to Earth at the end of the day's activities Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name."" Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. Crowds were asked to stay away but local beaches were still full The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Backlash after Trump signals US exit from WHO,"The US has been the largest single contributor to the WHO President Donald Trump has been criticised at home and abroad after announcing he is ending US ties with the World Health Organization (WHO). The EU urged him to reconsider the decision, while Germany's health minister called it a ""disappointing setback for international health"". The head of the US Senate's health committee, a Republican like Mr Trump, said now was not the time to leave. Mr Trump said the WHO had failed to hold China to account over coronavirus. The WHO, a UN agency that helps countries promote healthcare and tackle outbreaks of disease, has faced regular criticism from the US president over its handling of the outbreak. Trump's claims against WHO fact-checked He suspended US funding to the WHO last month and on Friday permanently halted the payment, which last year stood at more than $400m (Â£324m; â¬360m), the largest single contribution at around 15% of its total budget. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a statement: ""In the face of this global threat, now is the time for enhanced co-operation and common solutions. Actions that weaken international results must be avoided. ""We urge the US to reconsider its announced decision."" German Health Minister Jens Spahn described the setback as ""disappointing"" although he accepted the WHO ""needs reform"". ""The EU must take a leading role and engage more financially,"" he said. Mr Trump says the WHO has been a ""puppet of China"" A spokesperson for the UK said: ""Coronavirus is a global challenge and the World Health Organization has an important role to play in leading the international health response. We have no plans to withdraw our funding."" The chair of the US Senate Health Committee, Lamar Alexander, said the move could hamper the discovery of a vaccine against Covid-19 and urged a reversal of the decision in the ""strongest terms possible"". ""Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,"" he said. Ex-presidential candidate and US Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted: ""President Trump's decision to leave the @WHO during a global pandemic alienates our allies, undermines our global leadership, and threatens the health of the American people."" Anders Nordstrom, a former WHO acting director general, said he was ""deeply concerned"" the move would increase political tension at a time when ""we need to have global solidarity"". South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called the decision ""unfortunate"". WHO member states agreed on 19 May to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the pandemic. Speaking  at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs."" It is not clear when any US withdrawal might take place. A 1948 agreement between the US and WHO allows for one year's notice before pulling out. Mr Trump has accused China of trying to cover up the outbreak of coronavirus, which occurred in the city of Wuhan late last year. He also says that ""China has total control over the World Health Organization"". US-China battle over coronavirus The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to ""mislead the world"" about the virus, without elaborating. This video can not be played Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised China's early handling of the outbreak ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he said. The US will redirect its funds for the WHO  to other health groups. More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world. Opponents say Mr Trump is trying to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic ahead of his re-election bid this year. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has said that Mr Trump is trying to mislead the public, smear China and ""shift the blame for [the US's] own incompetent response"". Founded in 1948 and based in Geneva, Switzerland, it is the UN agency responsible for global public health Has 194 member states, and aims to ""promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable"" Involved in vaccination campaigns, health emergencies and supporting countries in primary care Funded by a combination of members' fees based on wealth and population and voluntary contributions A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals across Scotland have been diabetics, according to official figures. The statistics have
sparked calls for protection and guidelines for those with the condition as
lockdown restrictions begin to ease. It follows similar
reports that diabetics made up 30% of fatalities in hospitals south of the border. Figures from the National Records of Scotland show 554 of those who died with Covid-19 mentioned on their death certificates
up to 24 May also had diabetes - almost 15% of the total. Out of the 1,760
people who died in hospital with the virus, 341 (19%) were diabetics. A selection of Scottish artists are performing today to raise funds for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins and Glasgow-based PPE charity ViseUp.

Hearts owner Ann Budge told BBC Radio Scotland earlier that she was disappointed that the governing body had not pursued the matter with more vigour after she was approached as an intermediary. ""I have had a
number of conversations with Ann this week, including one that also involved
another club chairman,"" SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster responds. ""I am delighted to have heard Annâs comment on the
radio this afternoon that there are, in fact, no conditions attached to this
money. âI had been under the impression that Ann was going to
continue talking to the potential investors, but if it is now appropriate for
me to talk to them directly, I am very happy to do so."" Doncaster says he will speak again with Budge this weekend before the matter is discussed with clubs in the four divisions later in the week. Read more here. At the UK briefing, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason asks: ""What do you say to those scientists who say the government is easing the lockdown in England too quickly?"" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who announced the return of competitive UK sport behind closed doors from 1 June, begins by saying the scientists from Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) will all have ""their different perspectives"" and the government takes a ""collective view"". He says the scientists he has heard talking today are ""absolutely right to urge caution"", adding ""we are at a risky point"" with ""not much headroom"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam says: ""The easing of social distancing, the easing of lockdown has to go slowly... painstakingly. The scientists will continue to give that advice to the government, no apologies for that. ""I believe this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right. Contact tracing has got to go well, but the public has got to engage with it."" At the UK government briefing, Lesley from Whitstable asks why England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own track and trace systems and how these will interact with one another to ensure everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. Culture Secretary Dowden says, as we begin to get ""smaller numbers"" of people with the virus in the UK, an ""important part"" of keeping those numbers down will be testing people and then tracking who else they have been in contact with through contact tracers. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam adds that the NHS is a nationwide service for all its citizens but says it is ""logical"" there will be ""slight differences"" to the track and trace systems across devolved administrations. There have been 215 more deaths from coronavirus in the UK in the last 24 hours across all settings, the UK government has announced. A total of 38,376 have now died after testing positive. Murrayfield has emerged as the front-runner to stage a 'home' British and Irish Lions Test against Japan before next year's tour of South Africa. The fixture is pencilled in for Saturday, 26 June 2021, with the Lions' tour opener scheduled a week later. Meanwhile, Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend says he is behind the implementation of a global calendar and supports the proposal of running back-to-back international windows in October and November. ""Having a competitive element - whether it is a cup or league - would add something tangible,"" Townsend tells BBC 5 Live. ""It would be great to get the players together for a longer period."" Scotland's summer tour to South Africa and New Zealand was cancelled because of coronavirus, with Townsend hoping the Tests could be rescheduled later this year. Read more Reality Check Speaking on the Today programme, former chancellor Lord Lamont calls for the UK to re-examine the two-metre social distancing rule to see whether it should be reduced to one metre. He says some experts, like Prof Dingwall at Nottingham University, pointed out the scientific evidence on the need for a distance of at least two metres was âfragileâ. The World Health Organisation recommends keeping a social distance of at least one metre (three feet). Social distancing rules in different countries vary between one and two metres. France and Italyâs rules say you should keep one metre apart. Germany recommends a distance of 1.5 metres, while Spain, like the UK, has a two-metre rule. The US national advice is to keep six feet (1.8 metres) or âabout two armsâ lengthâ apart. For more on the science behind the two-metre rule, clickhere.

Ann Budge believes her league reconstruction proposal will fail Hearts owner Ann Budge says ""philanthropists"" have approached her offering millions of pounds to help Scotland's lower-league clubs but expressed her frustration with the response from the Scottish Professional Football League. The league asked the businesswoman to submit a discussion paper on league reconstruction, but she believes it is doomed to fail, admitting to BBC Scotland: ""A number of clubs won't be able to play next season behind closed doors."" Budge, whose club face relegation from the Premiership after reconstruction was rejected, claims that the league has been unhelpful over the offer of financial help. ""I'm being asked to put it in writing,"" she says. ""It's a nonsense, It's not quick enough, it's not decisive enough."" The SPFL turned down an offer to put chief executive Neil Doncaster up for comment about what Budge describes as ""an amazing philanthropic gesture"". Read more here. Celtic have urged the Scottish Professional Football League to issue the fixture calendar for a new season ""as soon as possible"". That is despite national clinical director Jason Leitch telling BBC Scotland this morning that fans should ""not write 1 August into their calendars quite yet - there's a long way to go before that"". Following a meeting with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick on Friday, the SPFL suggested that it will start a new season on that date - if Scotland has moved into phase two of its coronavirus recovery. The Scottish FA, meanwhile, suggested a targeted return date of 11 June for player training before the new campaign. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""We need to get back to football, safely, as soon as possible. That is our message and that is our aim."" Celtic urge the SPFL to release the fixture list ""as soon as possible"" before the Scottish Premiership's intended return in August. The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for easing the lockdown. 
Everything is provisional - for instance, there will have to be evidence that Covid-19 transmission is being controlled - but if all goes well, this is what we can expect. On Friday, the country entered the first phase of the Scottish government's four-phase ""route map"" for restarting society while attempting to suppress the virus. Phase two will happen when the virus is considered ""controlled"" and the R-number is consistently below 1. The health service must have adequate capacity and the test, trace and isolate system will be running effectively to suppress transmission. Phase three will happen when the virus is considered ""suppressed"". Many workplaces will have adapted, and the test and trace system will be able to quickly respond to any areas that need particular attention. Life will feel closer to normal. We will finally move into phase four when the virus remains suppressed at very low levels and is no longer considered a significant threat to public health. The government says it could take many months or longer to get to this stage. This video can not be played Lifting lockdown in Scotland: What can we do, and when?

Boy yearns to see seaman dad moored outside house,"A mother has told of the heartbreak of seeing her four-year-old son waving to his father who is unable to get off his ship when it is moored outside their house during the coronavirus lockdown. Seonaid Russell, 34, said it was ""tough"" to watch her son Euan yearn to see his bosun father when he was just 100 metres from their house in Oban. The family live in a cabin which overlooks the town's port. Alasdair Gordon, 41, is in charge of the deck on the Pharos. The ship is responsible for the operation of Scottish lighthouses. Since the lockdown, Alasdair and his crew have been instructed to stay on the ship when it is tied up in the dock. It has meant that when he is moored outside his own house he is not allowed to spend the night with his family as he usually would do. Seonaid said her son had shown great strength throughout the lockdown Seonaid said: ""His boat this week was back on Wednesday and it leaves on Monday, so that would have been five nights he would have been with us. ""Seeing him from the window is really hard as he's so near but yet so far. ""It was disheartening when I realised this was the position we were going to be in during the lockdown. ""Euan shouts 'dad' from the garden and balcony and waves and Alasdair can hear him and waves back, but he's not allowed to shout back. ""Euan can see him waving and runs into the kitchen and tells me 'dad's waving' and tells me to come and see, it's the highlight of his day."" Seonaid, an NHS infant feeding support worker, said she was used to her partner being away at sea, but had found it difficult during the lockdown. She said she worried about her son being affected by not being able to see his father when he knew he was so close. She said: ""It's a difficult thing. I've tried to keep upbeat in the hope it rubs off on to Euan. ""At the age of four the sense of loss can be overwhelming. I want to minimise that and try to make it as normal as possible for him by being honest that it will be a while before dad is back, but the feeling of sadness and loss will pass. ""We talk about it a lot and I explain to him in very basic terms, using words he understands, that germs mean dad has to stay on the boat and he understands."" Euan Gordon is just metres away from his dad's ship when it is moored near the edge of his garden Seonaid, who is pregnant with their second child, said: ""Euan always wants to get a closer look at his dad so we go to the edge of the garden to get a better look. The gates are closed so we can't go right up to the ship but it is close and Euan gets very excited about our daily trips there to the edge of our garden to see his dad. ""He says he is missing his dad but I'm astounded at how well he is coping with it and his strength at such a young age. ""I'm very thankful about this because the sense of loss for a four year old can be massive and hard to get your head around especially when you know your dad is so close."" Alasdair said: ""I find it quite frustrating, but I have to try and put it out of my mind and try to be professional about my work. ""It is quite difficult being so close to home but not able to go over there, especially when I can see them both and I can hear Euan shouting in the garden.

People removed from 'shielding lists' via text,"Samantha received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP. This has caused confusion, with charities demanding clearer guidance for this group as lockdown eases. GPs say they should be notified when their patients are added or removed from the lists. Shielding has now been extended until the end of June and is under constant review, the government says. Around 2.2 million people in the UK are staying at home to protect themselves from the virus because they were told they were at high risk of being seriously ill with Covid-19. But 40 healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Samantha Bruce, 35, from Rotherham, has severe asthma and was told to shield on 25 March. Out of the blue on Friday, she received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield, and her food deliveries would be stopped. Her first reaction was that it could be a scam, so she called her GP - but he ""didn't have a clue"" why she'd been sent the message. Further investigation by her GP revealed that Samantha no longer ticked the required boxes to shield, based on her medication. Rather than feeling reassured, she was left confused and anxious. ""It doesn't make sense - the virus isn't going anywhere so why is it that suddenly I don't need to shield anymore?"" Samantha is wondering whether to send her son back to school Samantha also has two children - aged four and 10 months - to consider, and her husband is disabled and can't drive. The change in advice has thrown up questions for the whole family. ""Do I let my son go back to school?"" she asks, if her risk increases by taking him there and coming into contact with other parents. She has already decided she ""won't set foot in a supermarket"" anytime soon and has arranged priority deliveries instead. But the fear of contracting the virus is still ""very worrying"". ""If I ended up in hospital I would have to involve my mum and dad with the children, and that's putting them at risk,"" she says. Alison Cook, director of external affairs at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they had heard of more people getting these official text messages with no explanation. At the same time, other people have received letters asking them to shield for longer - until the end of June. ""This is an utter mess,"" she said. ""There doesn't seem to be any evidence or logic behind these letters and texts."" CWho should be shielding? The government says all decisions about whether someone should shield are ""clinically led"" - in other words, made by doctors. ""Clinicians are identifying people who had initially been advised to shield from coronavirus but no longer need to do so,"" a spokesman said. GPs say this is a complex process and as the guidance changes, shielding will be relevant to different people. ""However, it is important that as guidance changes, and patients are either added or removed from 'shielding lists' based on conditions they have or medication they are taking, that GPs and relevant specialists are advised about this,"" the Royal College of GPs says. ""This is so that doctors can communicate effectively with their patients, if they have questions."" Sarah would love life return to normal - but she is scared, after staying at home for 50 days Shielding is taking a huge toll on millions of people who have not been outside of their home since March. They include people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, those who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months and those with severe respiratory conditions, such as severe asthma. What links them is that they are allat high risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus,external. As a result, they would have received a letter advising them to shield nearly 10 weeks ago, or been told to do so by their GP. That means they cannot leave their house, meet friends or family or come into contact with someone with coronavirus symptoms. Sarah Davis, 29, a freelance artist and sculptor who lives in London, knows how that feels. She has not left her house for 50 days now. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in 2017 and had to have a stem cell transplant in 2018. The impact on her immune system means she is extremely vulnerable. Shielding started off feeling surreal, now it just ""feels so unending"", Sarah says. She can't exercise properly indoors, she's had to give up all her freelance work and with the easing of lockdown measures for the general population, she feels left behind. ""We have had no new information in weeks. I feel stuck and isolated, unable to work in my art studio or move to a new house as planned,"" she says. ""Having been ill with cancer in the past, I do have coping mechanisms, but it is still a very triggering experience - to be locked away again and not know when it will all end."" Sarah has had to give up all her freelance art work while shielding Sarah wants the plight of people like her to be discussed at a national level so that they feel included in plans for their lives, as valid members of society. She is not alone - a group of 40 healthcare charities has written an open letter to the UK governments, calling for consistent advice on shielding measures for extremely vulnerable people. They include Macmillan Cancer Support, British Lung Foundation and Asthma UK, MS Society, Kidney Care UK and Cystic Fibrosis Trust - who all say more support and advice is needed as members of these people's households start to leave home to go to work or school. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says patients should contact their GP or hospital specialist if they are in any doubt about whether to shield or not. There is nothing Sarah would like more than to go outside and feel a sense of normality again - but she worries that when that decision is made, it could be for the wrong reasons. ""I don't want to be told to go out when it's not safe,"" she says. ""Staying indoors feels like a new normal - it's scary to come out of that, despite the fact I'd love to do it.""

Greece is to open up to tourists from 29 countries in two weeks - but not those travelling from the UK. Tourists from EU countries including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Finland will be able to visit from 15 June, the tourism ministry announced yesterday. But some of the world's worst-affected countries - including the UK, France, Italy and Spain - are not on the list. More countries could be added before 1 July, the ministry added.

The sun has drawn many of the Edinburgh public out to The Meadows Play has re-started at the Meadows Croquet Club, with the sport one of the outdoor pursuits permitted as part of phase one of Scotland's route map out of lockdown. Troon promenade has also been busy today. Reality Check UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said there have been 2,445 new infections over the last 24 hours, confirmed through testing. So, as the UK eases lockdown measures further, how do these case numbers compare with other European countries relaxing their restrictions? France and the UK have similar populations, of around 66 million, but France registered only 597 new infections yesterday. In Italy, a country of around 60 million, there were 516 new cases. Germany, with a population of 83 million, published a figure of 741 new infections yesterday. The Office for National Statistics puts the daily number of infections in England significantly higher than the daily figure confirmed by testing. It estimates, using survey data,that it could be as high as 8,000 per day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals across Scotland have been diabetics, according to official figures. The statistics have
sparked calls for protection and guidelines for those with the condition as
lockdown restrictions begin to ease. It follows similar
reports that diabetics made up 30% of fatalities in hospitals south of the border. Figures from the National Records of Scotland show 554 of those who died with Covid-19 mentioned on their death certificates
up to 24 May also had diabetes - almost 15% of the total. Out of the 1,760
people who died in hospital with the virus, 341 (19%) were diabetics. A selection of Scottish artists are performing today to raise funds for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins and Glasgow-based PPE charity ViseUp. It started at 15:00 BST and runs on until after midnight. Honeyblood, Peat & Diesel, The Fratellis, The Snuts, Wet Wet Wet and Amy MacDonald are among those taking part, with some choice DJs taking over from 21:10 BST. Youâll be able toview the stream here.,external Neil Doncaster will talk to Hearts owner Ann Budge again this weekend A claimed offer of millions of pounds by ""philanthropists"" to help Scotland's lower league football clubs survive the pandemic is to be investigated by the Scottish Professional Football League. Hearts owner Ann Budge told BBC Radio Scotland earlier that she was disappointed that the governing body had not pursued the matter with more vigour after she was approached as an intermediary. ""I have had a
number of conversations with Ann this week, including one that also involved
another club chairman,"" SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster responds. ""I am delighted to have heard Annâs comment on the
radio this afternoon that there are, in fact, no conditions attached to this
money. âI had been under the impression that Ann was going to
continue talking to the potential investors, but if it is now appropriate for
me to talk to them directly, I am very happy to do so."" Doncaster says he will speak again with Budge this weekend before the matter is discussed with clubs in the four divisions later in the week. Read more here. At the UK briefing, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason asks: ""What do you say to those scientists who say the government is easing the lockdown in England too quickly?"" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who announced the return of competitive UK sport behind closed doors from 1 June, begins by saying the scientists from Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) will all have ""their different perspectives"" and the government takes a ""collective view"". He says the scientists he has heard talking today are ""absolutely right to urge caution"", adding ""we are at a risky point"" with ""not much headroom"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam says: ""The easing of social distancing, the easing of lockdown has to go slowly... painstakingly. The scientists will continue to give that advice to the government, no apologies for that. ""I believe this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right. Contact tracing has got to go well, but the public has got to engage with it."" At the UK government briefing, Lesley from Whitstable asks why England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own track and trace systems and how these will interact with one another to ensure everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. Culture Secretary Dowden says, as we begin to get ""smaller numbers"" of people with the virus in the UK, an ""important part"" of keeping those numbers down will be testing people and then tracking who else they have been in contact with through contact tracers. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam adds that the NHS is a nationwide service for all its citizens but says it is ""logical"" there will be ""slight differences"" to the track and trace systems across devolved administrations. There have been 215 more deaths from coronavirus in the UK in the last 24 hours across all settings, the UK government has announced. A total of 38,376 have now died after testing positive. Murrayfield has emerged as the front-runner to stage a 'home' British and Irish Lions Test against Japan before next year's tour of South Africa. The fixture is pencilled in for Saturday, 26 June 2021, with the Lions' tour opener scheduled a week later. Meanwhile, Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend says he is behind the implementation of a global calendar and supports the proposal of running back-to-back international windows in October and November. ""Having a competitive element - whether it is a cup or league - would add something tangible,"" Townsend tells BBC 5 Live. ""It would be great to get the players together for a longer period."" Scotland's summer tour to South Africa and New Zealand was cancelled because of coronavirus, with Townsend hoping the Tests could be rescheduled later this year. Read more Reality Check Speaking on the Today programme, former chancellor Lord Lamont calls for the UK to re-examine the two-metre social distancing rule to see whether it should be reduced to one metre. He says some experts, like Prof Dingwall at Nottingham University, pointed out the scientific evidence on the need for a distance of at least two metres was âfragileâ. The World Health Organisation recommends keeping a social distance of at least one metre (three feet). Social distancing rules in different countries vary between one and two metres. France and Italyâs rules say you should keep one metre apart. Germany recommends a distance of 1.5 metres, while Spain, like the UK, has a two-metre rule. The US national advice is to keep six feet (1.8 metres) or âabout two armsâ lengthâ apart. For more on the science behind the two-metre rule, clickhere. We have had it confirmed that the UK government will give its daily coronavirus briefing at 16:00 BST. The briefing will be led by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden. He will be joined by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam. Ann Budge believes her league reconstruction proposal will fail Hearts owner Ann Budge says ""philanthropists"" have approached her offering millions of pounds to help Scotland's lower-league clubs but expressed her frustration with the response from the Scottish Professional Football League. The league asked the businesswoman to submit a discussion paper on league reconstruction, but she believes it is doomed to fail, admitting to BBC Scotland: ""A number of clubs won't be able to play next season behind closed doors."" Budge, whose club face relegation from the Premiership after reconstruction was rejected, claims that the league has been unhelpful over the offer of financial help. ""I'm being asked to put it in writing,"" she says. ""It's a nonsense, It's not quick enough, it's not decisive enough."" The SPFL turned down an offer to put chief executive Neil Doncaster up for comment about what Budge describes as ""an amazing philanthropic gesture"". Read more here. Celtic have urged the Scottish Professional Football League to issue the fixture calendar for a new season ""as soon as possible"". That is despite national clinical director Jason Leitch telling BBC Scotland this morning that fans should ""not write 1 August into their calendars quite yet - there's a long way to go before that"". Following a meeting with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick on Friday, the SPFL suggested that it will start a new season on that date - if Scotland has moved into phase two of its coronavirus recovery. The Scottish FA, meanwhile, suggested a targeted return date of 11 June for player training before the new campaign. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""We need to get back to football, safely, as soon as possible. That is our message and that is our aim."" Celtic urge the SPFL to release the fixture list ""as soon as possible"" before the Scottish Premiership's intended return in August. The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for easing the lockdown. 
Everything is provisional - for instance, there will have to be evidence that Covid-19 transmission is being controlled - but if all goes well, this is what we can expect. On Friday, the country entered the first phase of the Scottish government's four-phase ""route map"" for restarting society while attempting to suppress the virus. Phase two will happen when the virus is considered ""controlled"" and the R-number is consistently below 1. The health service must have adequate capacity and the test, trace and isolate system will be running effectively to suppress transmission. Phase three will happen when the virus is considered ""suppressed"". Many workplaces will have adapted, and the test and trace system will be able to quickly respond to any areas that need particular attention. Life will feel closer to normal. We will finally move into phase four when the virus remains suppressed at very low levels and is no longer considered a significant threat to public health. The government says it could take many months or longer to get to this stage. This video can not be played Lifting lockdown in Scotland: What can we do, and when? Angie BrownBBC Scotland news reporter A mother has told of the heartbreak of seeing her four year old son waving to his father who is unable to get off his ship when it is moored outside their house during the coronavirus lockdown. Seonaid Russell, 34, said it was ""tough"" to watch her son Euan yearn to see his bosun father when he was just 100 metres from their house in Oban. The family live in a cabin which overlooks the town's port. Alasdair Gordon, 41, is an officer in charge of the deck on the Pharos. The ship is responsible for the operation of Scottish lighthouses. Since the lockdown, Alasdair and his crew have been instructed to stay on the ship when it is tied up in the dock. It has meant that when he is moored outside his own house he is not allowed to spend the night with his family as he usually would do. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts strap in for flightSpaceX will need to beat the weather to get Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit.,"This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit. It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX. Live: Astronauts make history How we got to this point Evolution of the spacesuit Who are the astronauts? Key questions about the mission It was a triumphant day for Elon Musk and his SpaceX company It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters. Doug Hurley (L) and Bob Behnken (R) will be in space for up to four months The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. ""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil."" Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Behnken (far) and Hurley (near) called down to Earth at the end of the day's activities Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name."" Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. Crowds were asked to stay away but local beaches were still full The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

"Risk in lockdown easing too soon, warn scientists","Scientific advisers to the government have warned of the risk of lifting the lockdown in England, as sunshine marks the final weekend before rules change. Professor John Edmunds said it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures; Sir Jeremy Farrar said the NHS test and trace system should be ""fully working"". From Monday schools will reopen and up to six people can meet in England, with other nations also easing measures. The government said it had followed the data and evidence at all times. Another 215 people across the UK who tested positive for coronavirus have now died, taking the total death toll to 38,376. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government, has published details of its confidential meetings. It includes minutes of 34 Sage sessions, going back to 22 January, and a series of scientific reports. They show one Sage meeting on 23 April estimated there would be only 1,000 cases per day by mid-May. Instead,estimates by the Office for National Statisticssuggest there are currently 8,000 cases per day in England alone. Those figures do not include cases in care homes or hospitals. Professor warns on 'political' lockdown decision Can I host a barbecue? A practical guide to how to socialise now Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said the levels of coronavirus were still ""very high"" and many scientists would rather the number of cases declined before measures were relaxed. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, saidon Twitter,externalthat Covid-19 is ""spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England"" and NHS test and trace ""has to be fully working and infection rates have to be lower"". This video can not be played Professor Sian Griffith and Professor Sally Bloomfield on the risks of easing lockdown Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Peter Horby, who sits on Sage and chairs its NERVTAG subcommittee, agreed, saying the R number was still close to one and it was important we ""don't lose control"". ""What I would say is that returning to a situation where we lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures,"" he said. A fourth Sage member, Prof Calum Semple, said a ""brave"" political decision had been made to coincide with when schools were due to reopen ""were everything normal"", but warned that high levels of transmission were still being seen. ""Essentially we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,"" he said. ""We need to get it down to simmer before we take the lift off, and it's too early."" This is a significant moment. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. Now there is a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those ""following the science"". They may not be household names, but those speaking out are big figures in their fields and sit on Sage for a reason. On Thursday, Boris Johnson confirmed the relaxing of lockdown. At the same televised briefing, the PM's chief science advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned there was ""not a lot of room"" for manoeuvre and the data ""urges caution"". This is largely a disagreement about ""when"" to start lifting lockdown rather ""how"". If you go early then we all get a bit of our lives back sooner, but it means we will stay close to that 8,000 cases a day figure and have less time to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed if a second wave comes. If you wait longer, then cases are much lower and the virus easier to control, the price is keeping lockdown and all the pain it is causing. The Sage documents warned there would be ""little time"" to reimpose stricter lockdown measures if the infection rate started to creep up again. Epidemiologist Prof Sian Griffiths told BBC Breakfast that if scientists were in charge of decisions, lockdown would probably not be eased currently, but she said there were other factors to consider. ""I would say there is a huge amount of stress and strain which goes along with not being able to see your friends and your family and that to be able to see them, albeit at a distance, may actually help people's mental health and may help them live with lockdown better and may help them comply better,"" she said. Prof Sally Bloomfield, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warned against having a barbecue with guests, saying the virus could be present on bottles, cutlery and other objects. Picnics where people brought their own food were a better option, she said. One method of managing the easing of lockdown would be to give people a Covid risk score which would account for age, gender, ethnicity and health conditions, according to Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter - chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge. ""And that means I think we're going to need some sort of individualised Covid risk score that can be used in that way, to group people according to their risk, and then that would be advisory, and if people wanted to move, and they protected other people, then that would be open to them,"" he said. A Number 10 spokesperson said the government had ""at all times been informed by the data and evidence"", and the measures has been carefully designed ""so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one"". It comes as police forces in England have warned people to take care in busy areas and beauty spots and as a fine weekend of weather is forecast. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union blamed mixed government messaging for ""chaos"" on rail services in Bournemouth due to a surge in passengers. Each of the UK's nations has a different approach - and timescale - to lifting the lockdown on Monday. England is the only nation to reopen primary schools to selected year groups on Monday and will allow groups of up to six to meet outside. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors and in Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. In Wales, any number of people from two different households will be able to meet each other outside from Monday, but beauty spots will remain closed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? England remains at level four on the government's Covid-19 alert system, which means transmission of the virus is high or rising exponentially. When the system was introduced the prime minister said the country was heading towards level three - at which there can be a relaxation of the rules. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply concerned"" that the government was rushing too fast to lift lockdown measures as the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which sets the alert level, had not said the country was ready to move to level three. ""I urge Londoners to act with caution - lives depend on it,"" he tweeted.

"LiveLiveCoronavirus in England: Latest updates4 minutes ago4 minutes ago Lockdown ""glimmer of hope"" for breastfeeding mothersLockdown ""glimmer of hope"" for breastfeeding mothers6 minutes ago MP's ""think twice"" warning to avoid the beachesMP's ""think twice"" warning to avoid the beaches8 minutes ago Dispersal order on beach after 'large gatherings'Dispersal order on beach after 'large gatherings'","Updates on Saturday 30 May Risk in lockdown easing to soon, warn scientists Covid costs 'hit private renters hard' Furlough scheme to finish at end of October Six percent of virus-hit hospital staff test positive Artist to paint 20 portraits for 'NHS heroes' Rob Stevens and Kate Darlington That's it for our updates on the coronavirus pandemic and how it's impacting England today. We'll have more live coverage tomorrow. In the meantime, here's a reminder of thecurrent rules on social distancing and advice on when to self-isolate. The lockdown has helped mothers get more breastfeeding time due to the extra time at home and fewer visitors, health officials in
Liverpool have said. Ahead
of National Breastfeeding Week on Monday, Matt Ashton, director of public health
in the city, said: âBreastfeeding for even a short period gives children the
best start in life andâ¦ this year we all find ourselves in extraordinary
circumstances, but to hear that many women are finding more time to breastfeed
brings a glimmer of hope to what has been a difficult few months.â Sarah
King, who recently gave birth, said: âBreastfeeding terrified me and I set out
to only do six weeks initially but this time has made me love it and feel super
confident about doing it.â An MP has called for people from outside the
popular Formby coast to âthink twiceâ before visiting its beach. Hundreds have been enjoying the sunshine at the National
Trust reserve in Merseyside, plus at the nearby Crosby beach, although there have been complaints about some
leaving rubbish. Sefton Central MP Bill Esterson said: âThe litter
is a disgrace and I cannot believe people leave litter behind. If they managed
to bring it with them, why can't they just take it all home again? âMany people want to visit the beach from outside
Formby. This is a problem at the best of times and I continue to ask people
from out of area to think twice especially right now about visiting.â Andrew SegalBBC South West A dispersal order has been put on a beach in north Cornwall after ""reports of large gatherings"" on sand dunes, police said. Devon and Cornwall Police's team in Bude said on Facebook the 48-hour order had been put in place on nearby Summerleaze beach after ""substantial litter and mess"" was left behind on Friday. Ch Insp Julian Morris said the order, effective immediately, would let officers disperse ""anyone likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress by their actions or behaviour in Bude town and beaches"". Passengers have started boarding London buses from the front again for the first time since April. Front boardinghad been stopped in light of the coronavirus pandemic to help protect staff. Transport for London says new measures including improvements to screens for drivers means it's now safe to go back to the front-boarding system. Plans to make roads in Southampton city centre traffic-free to help people trying to commute at a safe social distance, have been revealed. Southampton City Council said it plans to close six central roads as part of a six-month trial, which could start as early as the summer. Portland Terrace, Above Bar Street, New Road, Civic Centre Road, London Road and Bellevue Road would close to traffic - except for cyclists, buses, taxis and access for servicing and homes. The measures were announced as part of the authority's Â£4.1m Green Transport Recovery Plan, which comes from existing budgets and money from central government, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Extinction Rebellion has held a series of protests across London. Dozens of people from the environmental protest group gathered in Parliament Square, at the Woolwich Centre and in Richmond. They called for environmental policies to be at the heart of the government's decisions as the country moves out of lockdown. The Met Police said a small number of people had been arrested in relation to breaches of Covid-19 regulations and some Fixed Penalty Notices were issued. The UK government has approved the return of domestic competitive sport behind closed doors from 1 June. The 'phase three' guidancepaves the way for live sport to return for the first time since mid-March. It is up to individual sports to assess the risk and consult athletes, coaches and support staff. Horse racing is among the first to resume with a meeting at Newcastle on Monday, while Premier League football is due to resume on 17 June. Clubs in England's top flight returned to 'phase two' contact training on 25 May. ""The wait is over. Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments,"" said the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Oliver Dowden. BBC Spotlight Any beach that is too busy to allow safe social distancing should not be visited, police in Devon and Cornwall have said. The advice has come as RNLI lifeguard patrolsresumed on seven beaches in the county and one in Devon. Sgt Andy Mulhern said people must follow safety advice. If you can get out, and it's safe, then by all means visit a life-guarded beach. But you have to bear in mind that, if they are crowded, you've got to give it a miss. You've got to protect your family... and that will ultimately save lives."" Sgt Andy Mulhern, Devon and Cornwall Police Daniel ClarkLocal Democracy Reporting Service A councillor has criticised members of the public who have verbally abused staff at Devonâs reopened recycling centres. Devon County Council cabinet member Andrea Davis said the behaviour of a minority of people had been ""appalling and totally unacceptable"" and urged visitors to ""be kind to our key workers, please"". The centres reopened last weekfor essential use onlyto cars without trailers, with a one-in, one-out policy and social distancing measures. The council said the vehicle restrictions were a temporary measure to ensure queues were kept to a minimum and would be reviewed once demand had dropped to ""more manageable levels"". Amy LofthouseBBC Sport The coronavirus pandemic has prevented any cricket being played in England until at least July. The hopes for this summer were that The Hundred would take the women's game to a new audience, alongside a Â£20m investment to fund 40 new professional contracts. That money - described as ""unprecedented"" at the time - was part of a huge Â£50m funding plan aimed at closing the gap between England and Australia at international and domestic level. England had a full international summer planned before they set about defending the 50-over World Cup in February 2021. So what happens now? What cricket will we see this summer? And what next for the women's game? This video can not be played Lockdown measures in England are easing from Monday, but some scientists have  warned the government is lifting restrictions too soon. Epidemic specialist Professor Sian Griffith and Professor Sally Bloomfield, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, have urged the public to remember there are still risks and they will need to be cautious and vigilant. More than 50% of coronavirus patients who underwent surgery suffered from post-operative pulmonary complications, a new study suggests. In the study, published in The Lancet, post-operative pulmonary complications occurred in 51.2% of coronavirus patients who underwent surgery. These complications included conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and/or unexpected postoperative ventilation. Lead author Dr Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Medical teams should consider postponing non-critical procedures and promoting other treatment options, which may delay the need for surgery or sometimes avoid it altogether."" NHS England has announced 146 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The latest figures bring the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,529. Thousands of people in Bristol are without water, or have low pressure, after a water main fractured in the early hours of this morning. Bristol Water said the burst on Royate Hill was affecting customers in the BS5, BS6, BS7, BS9, BS15 and BS16 areas. It said the repair was ""trickier than first thought"" butengineers had restored supplies to some peopleby rerouting the network. The firm is working with the council to distribute bottled water while maintaining social distancing. Messages thanking waste collectors in County Durham have gone on show on the side of bin wagons. The County Council said that bin crews had been ""inundated"" with drawings and letters of appreciation from residents which had helped lift spirits while they have been carrying out collections. Some of the drawings have now been blown up and displayed on three of the vehicles. Councillor Brian Stephens, cabinet member for neighbourhoods and local partnerships, said: ""These displays of gratitude for our bin crews really do highlight that good work does not go unnoticed, and that a small gesture, such as a small thank you note, can make a big difference."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of public order offences after fighting broke out at a birthday party, Lancashire Police said. Officers said they were âmet by a barrage of abuseâ after being called to reports of a gathering that âgot out of handâ at Dunnyshop Avenue, Accrington in the early hours of this morning. âPeople who organise or attend any of these sorts of events will be dealt with accordingly as Covid fines can still be issued to anyone in breach of the rules,"" a spokesperson for the force said. This video can not be played âWhy I recreated my local pub in virtual realityâ The coronavirus lockdown has seen pubs and bars closed in England but one man has missed his local so much that he decided to recreate it in virtual reality. Tristan Cross taught himself how to make the 3D models by watching videos on YouTube. It took him two and half weeks to create the virtual environment. The Lake District National Park Authority has urged visitors to show ""care and consideration"" for everyone who lives and works in the area. With the good weather expected to bring an influx of visitors, they are asking people not to flout social distancing rules. It is feared ""hot spot"" areas such as Windermere, Ambleside, Glenridding and Devilâs Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale could become overwhelmed and people are being advised to avoid them. Visitors are also being reminded there is a ban on overnight camping and cafes remain closed. If you do visit, please use a car park, plan ahead, donât light barbecues and take your litter home when you leave."" Richard Leafe, Chief executive, Lake District National Park Authority A water company has apologised after there was ""low pressure and/or no supply in a number of areas"". Severn Trent said yesterday was another day of ""incredibly high demand for treated water"" across pretty much its entire area - almost reaching its highest ever level and finishing at 2.275bn litres. The Coventry-based company said it knew ""just how difficult it must be with the heat and with
everyone needing to wash their hands... during the
coronavirus crisis"". Areas affected included Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, Knaptoft in Leicestershire, Rugby in Warwickshire, Much Wenlock in Shropshire and Bushbury in Wolverhampton. Â© 2025 BBC.

People removed from 'shielding lists' via textThis has caused confusion and anxiety among extremely vulnerable people staying at home.Health,"Samantha received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP. This has caused confusion, with charities demanding clearer guidance for this group as lockdown eases. GPs say they should be notified when their patients are added or removed from the lists. Shielding has now been extended until the end of June and is under constant review, the government says. Around 2.2 million people in the UK are staying at home to protect themselves from the virus because they were told they were at high risk of being seriously ill with Covid-19. But 40 healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Samantha Bruce, 35, from Rotherham, has severe asthma and was told to shield on 25 March. Out of the blue on Friday, she received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield, and her food deliveries would be stopped. Her first reaction was that it could be a scam, so she called her GP - but he ""didn't have a clue"" why she'd been sent the message. Further investigation by her GP revealed that Samantha no longer ticked the required boxes to shield, based on her medication. Rather than feeling reassured, she was left confused and anxious. ""It doesn't make sense - the virus isn't going anywhere so why is it that suddenly I don't need to shield anymore?"" Samantha is wondering whether to send her son back to school Samantha also has two children - aged four and 10 months - to consider, and her husband is disabled and can't drive. The change in advice has thrown up questions for the whole family. ""Do I let my son go back to school?"" she asks, if her risk increases by taking him there and coming into contact with other parents. She has already decided she ""won't set foot in a supermarket"" anytime soon and has arranged priority deliveries instead. But the fear of contracting the virus is still ""very worrying"". ""If I ended up in hospital I would have to involve my mum and dad with the children, and that's putting them at risk,"" she says. Alison Cook, director of external affairs at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they had heard of more people getting these official text messages with no explanation. At the same time, other people have received letters asking them to shield for longer - until the end of June. ""This is an utter mess,"" she said. ""There doesn't seem to be any evidence or logic behind these letters and texts."" CWho should be shielding? The government says all decisions about whether someone should shield are ""clinically led"" - in other words, made by doctors. ""Clinicians are identifying people who had initially been advised to shield from coronavirus but no longer need to do so,"" a spokesman said. GPs say this is a complex process and as the guidance changes, shielding will be relevant to different people. ""However, it is important that as guidance changes, and patients are either added or removed from 'shielding lists' based on conditions they have or medication they are taking, that GPs and relevant specialists are advised about this,"" the Royal College of GPs says. ""This is so that doctors can communicate effectively with their patients, if they have questions."" Sarah would love life return to normal - but she is scared, after staying at home for 50 days Shielding is taking a huge toll on millions of people who have not been outside of their home since March. They include people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, those who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months and those with severe respiratory conditions, such as severe asthma. What links them is that they are allat high risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus,external. As a result, they would have received a letter advising them to shield nearly 10 weeks ago, or been told to do so by their GP. That means they cannot leave their house, meet friends or family or come into contact with someone with coronavirus symptoms. Sarah Davis, 29, a freelance artist and sculptor who lives in London, knows how that feels. She has not left her house for 50 days now. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in 2017 and had to have a stem cell transplant in 2018. The impact on her immune system means she is extremely vulnerable. Shielding started off feeling surreal, now it just ""feels so unending"", Sarah says. She can't exercise properly indoors, she's had to give up all her freelance work and with the easing of lockdown measures for the general population, she feels left behind. ""We have had no new information in weeks. I feel stuck and isolated, unable to work in my art studio or move to a new house as planned,"" she says. ""Having been ill with cancer in the past, I do have coping mechanisms, but it is still a very triggering experience - to be locked away again and not know when it will all end."" Sarah has had to give up all her freelance art work while shielding Sarah wants the plight of people like her to be discussed at a national level so that they feel included in plans for their lives, as valid members of society. She is not alone - a group of 40 healthcare charities has written an open letter to the UK governments, calling for consistent advice on shielding measures for extremely vulnerable people. They include Macmillan Cancer Support, British Lung Foundation and Asthma UK, MS Society, Kidney Care UK and Cystic Fibrosis Trust - who all say more support and advice is needed as members of these people's households start to leave home to go to work or school. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says patients should contact their GP or hospital specialist if they are in any doubt about whether to shield or not. There is nothing Sarah would like more than to go outside and feel a sense of normality again - but she worries that when that decision is made, it could be for the wrong reasons. ""I don't want to be told to go out when it's not safe,"" she says. ""Staying indoors feels like a new normal - it's scary to come out of that, despite the fact I'd love to do it.""

"Covid costs hit private renters hard, says reportPrivate renters are struggling with housing costs more than mortgage-payers, new research suggests.Business","Private renters are more likely to be struggling with payments than those who own their homes, new research by the Resolution Foundation suggests. The think tank concludes one in eight private renters have fallen behind with housing costs since the coronavirus crisis began, compared to one in 12 mortgaged home owners. Its report is based on a YouGov survey of around 6,000 adults in the UK. The government says it took action to support renters during the pandemic. The action, which the government calls ""unprecedented"" includes banning evictions for three months and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. Lindsay Judge, principal policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said renters tended to be in a weaker financial position going into the crisis. ""They had lower levels of savings for example, and they spent considerably more of their income on housing costs in the first place. It's also fair to say home owners have been more successful at directly reducing their housing costs, so we've seen many more home owners issued a mortgage holiday than renters are being given reductions in rent."" The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has warned ""there is a looming crisis in the private rental sector"", with thousands of tenants unable to pay their rent having lost their jobs or seen a significant loss of income. The committee's chair, Labour MP Clive Betts, told the BBC the UK was currently in ""the lull before the storm."" Citizens Advice has estimated that around 2.6 million tenants expect to fall behind on their rent because of coronavirus. Its principal policy manager Joe Lane warned renters are now facing a countdown to the end of protection from eviction. ""What we want the government to do is make sure there are protections for people who have fallen into arrears due to coronavirus, and also take steps to make sure landlords have to put in place things like affordable repayment plans and make sure the requirement to work with renters has some teeth."" The housing charity Shelter said its emergency helpline has been inundated with calls from distressed renters who have lost their jobs and are terrified of losing their homes. Private renter Dennie Smith says rent had been a struggle after her hair salon was forced to close Dennie Smith has been renting her family home for five years. She says that until the pandemic came along, she had never missed a payment. The Â£1,950 monthly rent has been a struggle since her husband lost his job last autumn. Then her South Croydon hair salon Vintage 62 had to close in late March because of the Covid-19 shutdown, meaning a sudden loss of income. Dennie says her landlord agreed she could postpone two months' rent, but she will still need to pay back the arrears in future. ""We managed to pay March but at the moment we owe April and May, and then June is due on Monday. I feel sick actually, because at the moment that's one of our biggest outgoings, the rent."" Her husband is about to start a new job, but will have a lower salary than before.  She hopes her business is able to re-open as soon as possible and that customers do come back quickly. But landlords are also feeling the knock-on effects. The National Residential Landlords' Association (NRLA) says that due to the virus, 54% of its members have experienced some combination of rent payment problems or unanticipated periods when properties are empty. Buy-to-let landlords are eligible for three-month mortgage holidays. The NRLA says this is helping to sustain tenancies, but means a cost further down the line. Sussex-based landlady Sue Hull has eight properties. One set of tenants, a couple who work full-time, had to self-isolate after their child displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Sue was sympathetic when they said how much they received in statutory sick-pay would affect their ability to pay rent, so she agreed to defer payments for two months, to be paid back over two years. Sue Hull says applying for mortgage holidays could hinder future plans to re-mortgage two other properties Sue does not want to apply for a mortgage holiday from a buy-to-let lender because she fears it would affect how lenders perceive her situation when she tries to re-mortgage two other properties. ""I've also got another property that's empty I'm paying council tax on"" she says. ""Presently I'm having to take Â£600 pounds a month from my own savings. So it is not something I want to sustain in the long term"". Ben Beadle, chief executive at the NRLA said landlords are nervous. ""A number of our members are having issues that arose pre-Covid and not able to get possession of their property. With any sort of ban - we don't see that as being a long-term solution. We think a careful re-opening of evictions needs to take place that prioritises pre-Covid debt, anti-social behaviour and prioritises domestic violence."" The NRLA wants to see existing support extended to help tenants cover their costs, including the elimination of the five week waiting time for Universal Credit. Clive Betts said that although the government was considering a ""Pre-Action Protocol"" encouraging landlords to reach out to private tenants to understand their position before taking court action, this would only be worthwhile if the courts had discretion to make sure an attempt had been made to reach an agreement with their tenants. The UK housing and rental markets are expected to be buffeted by the fallout from coronavirus A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We've taken unprecedented action to support renters and landlords during the pandemic - including banning evictions and increasing Local Housing Allowance (LHA) - and we've always said we will keep this under review. ""To help prevent people getting into financial hardship or rent arrears, we've given support for business to pay staff salaries and strengthened the welfare safety-net.

Boy yearns to see seaman dad who is moored outside house,"A mother has told of the heartbreak of seeing her four-year-old son waving to his father who is unable to get off his ship when it is moored outside their house during the coronavirus lockdown. Seonaid Russell, 34, said it was ""tough"" to watch her son Euan yearn to see his bosun father when he was just 100 metres from their house in Oban. The family live in a cabin which overlooks the town's port. Alasdair Gordon, 41, is in charge of the deck on the Pharos. The ship is responsible for the operation of Scottish lighthouses. Since the lockdown, Alasdair and his crew have been instructed to stay on the ship when it is tied up in the dock. It has meant that when he is moored outside his own house he is not allowed to spend the night with his family as he usually would do. Seonaid said her son had shown great strength throughout the lockdown Seonaid said: ""His boat this week was back on Wednesday and it leaves on Monday, so that would have been five nights he would have been with us. ""Seeing him from the window is really hard as he's so near but yet so far. ""It was disheartening when I realised this was the position we were going to be in during the lockdown. ""Euan shouts 'dad' from the garden and balcony and waves and Alasdair can hear him and waves back, but he's not allowed to shout back. ""Euan can see him waving and runs into the kitchen and tells me 'dad's waving' and tells me to come and see, it's the highlight of his day."" Seonaid, an NHS infant feeding support worker, said she was used to her partner being away at sea, but had found it difficult during the lockdown. She said she worried about her son being affected by not being able to see his father when he knew he was so close. She said: ""It's a difficult thing. I've tried to keep upbeat in the hope it rubs off on to Euan. ""At the age of four the sense of loss can be overwhelming. I want to minimise that and try to make it as normal as possible for him by being honest that it will be a while before dad is back, but the feeling of sadness and loss will pass. ""We talk about it a lot and I explain to him in very basic terms, using words he understands, that germs mean dad has to stay on the boat and he understands."" Euan Gordon is just metres away from his dad's ship when it is moored near the edge of his garden Seonaid, who is pregnant with their second child, said: ""Euan always wants to get a closer look at his dad so we go to the edge of the garden to get a better look. The gates are closed so we can't go right up to the ship but it is close and Euan gets very excited about our daily trips there to the edge of our garden to see his dad. ""He says he is missing his dad but I'm astounded at how well he is coping with it and his strength at such a young age. ""I'm very thankful about this because the sense of loss for a four year old can be massive and hard to get your head around especially when you know your dad is so close."" Alasdair said: ""I find it quite frustrating, but I have to try and put it out of my mind and try to be professional about my work. ""It is quite difficult being so close to home but not able to go over there, especially when I can see them both and I can hear Euan shouting in the garden. ""It would be better to be out at sea, away from the town.""

Greece is to open up to tourists from 29 countries in two weeks - but not those travelling from the UK. Tourists from EU countries including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Finland will be able to visit from 15 June, the tourism ministry announced yesterday. But some of the world's worst-affected countries - including the UK, France, Italy and Spain - are not on the list. More countries could be added before 1 July, the ministry added.

So, as the UK eases lockdown measures further, how do these case numbers compare with other European countries relaxing their restrictions? France and the UK have similar populations, of around 66 million, but France registered only 597 new infections yesterday. In Italy, a country of around 60 million, there were 516 new cases. Germany, with a population of 83 million, published a figure of 741 new infections yesterday. The Office for National Statistics puts the daily number of infections in England significantly higher than the daily figure confirmed by testing. It estimates, using survey data,that it could be as high as 8,000 per day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals across Scotland have been diabetics, according to official figures. The statistics have
sparked calls for protection and guidelines for those with the condition as
lockdown restrictions begin to ease. It follows similar
reports that diabetics made up 30% of fatalities in hospitals south of the border. Figures from the National Records of Scotland show 554 of those who died with Covid-19 mentioned on their death certificates
up to 24 May also had diabetes - almost 15% of the total. Out of the 1,760
people who died in hospital with the virus, 341 (19%) were diabetics. A selection of Scottish artists are performing today to raise funds for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins and Glasgow-based PPE charity ViseUp. It started at 15:00 BST and runs on until after midnight. Honeyblood, Peat & Diesel, The Fratellis, The Snuts, Wet Wet Wet and Amy MacDonald are among those taking part, with some choice DJs taking over from 21:10 BST. Youâll be able toview the stream here.,external Neil Doncaster will talk to Hearts owner Ann Budge again this weekend A claimed offer of millions of pounds by ""philanthropists"" to help Scotland's lower league football clubs survive the pandemic is to be investigated by the Scottish Professional Football League. Hearts owner Ann Budge told BBC Radio Scotland earlier that she was disappointed that the governing body had not pursued the matter with more vigour after she was approached as an intermediary. ""I have had a
number of conversations with Ann this week, including one that also involved
another club chairman,"" SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster responds. ""I am delighted to have heard Annâs comment on the
radio this afternoon that there are, in fact, no conditions attached to this
money. âI had been under the impression that Ann was going to
continue talking to the potential investors, but if it is now appropriate for
me to talk to them directly, I am very happy to do so."" Doncaster says he will speak again with Budge this weekend before the matter is discussed with clubs in the four divisions later in the week. Read more here. At the UK briefing, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason asks: ""What do you say to those scientists who say the government is easing the lockdown in England too quickly?"" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who announced the return of competitive UK sport behind closed doors from 1 June, begins by saying the scientists from Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) will all have ""their different perspectives"" and the government takes a ""collective view"". He says the scientists he has heard talking today are ""absolutely right to urge caution"", adding ""we are at a risky point"" with ""not much headroom"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam says: ""The easing of social distancing, the easing of lockdown has to go slowly... painstakingly. The scientists will continue to give that advice to the government, no apologies for that. ""I believe this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right. Contact tracing has got to go well, but the public has got to engage with it."" At the UK government briefing, Lesley from Whitstable asks why England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own track and trace systems and how these will interact with one another to ensure everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. Culture Secretary Dowden says, as we begin to get ""smaller numbers"" of people with the virus in the UK, an ""important part"" of keeping those numbers down will be testing people and then tracking who else they have been in contact with through contact tracers. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam adds that the NHS is a nationwide service for all its citizens but says it is ""logical"" there will be ""slight differences"" to the track and trace systems across devolved administrations. There have been 215 more deaths from coronavirus in the UK in the last 24 hours across all settings, the UK government has announced. A total of 38,376 have now died after testing positive. Murrayfield has emerged as the front-runner to stage a 'home' British and Irish Lions Test against Japan before next year's tour of South Africa. The fixture is pencilled in for Saturday, 26 June 2021, with the Lions' tour opener scheduled a week later. Meanwhile, Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend says he is behind the implementation of a global calendar and supports the proposal of running back-to-back international windows in October and November. ""Having a competitive element - whether it is a cup or league - would add something tangible,"" Townsend tells BBC 5 Live. ""It would be great to get the players together for a longer period."" Scotland's summer tour to South Africa and New Zealand was cancelled because of coronavirus, with Townsend hoping the Tests could be rescheduled later this year. Read more Reality Check Speaking on the Today programme, former chancellor Lord Lamont calls for the UK to re-examine the two-metre social distancing rule to see whether it should be reduced to one metre. He says some experts, like Prof Dingwall at Nottingham University, pointed out the scientific evidence on the need for a distance of at least two metres was âfragileâ. The World Health Organisation recommends keeping a social distance of at least one metre (three feet). Social distancing rules in different countries vary between one and two metres. France and Italyâs rules say you should keep one metre apart. Germany recommends a distance of 1.5 metres, while Spain, like the UK, has a two-metre rule. The US national advice is to keep six feet (1.8 metres) or âabout two armsâ lengthâ apart. For more on the science behind the two-metre rule, clickhere. We have had it confirmed that the UK government will give its daily coronavirus briefing at 16:00 BST. The briefing will be led by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden. He will be joined by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam. Ann Budge believes her league reconstruction proposal will fail Hearts owner Ann Budge says ""philanthropists"" have approached her offering millions of pounds to help Scotland's lower-league clubs but expressed her frustration with the response from the Scottish Professional Football League. The league asked the businesswoman to submit a discussion paper on league reconstruction, but she believes it is doomed to fail, admitting to BBC Scotland: ""A number of clubs won't be able to play next season behind closed doors."" Budge, whose club face relegation from the Premiership after reconstruction was rejected, claims that the league has been unhelpful over the offer of financial help. ""I'm being asked to put it in writing,"" she says. ""It's a nonsense, It's not quick enough, it's not decisive enough."" The SPFL turned down an offer to put chief executive Neil Doncaster up for comment about what Budge describes as ""an amazing philanthropic gesture"". Read more here. Celtic have urged the Scottish Professional Football League to issue the fixture calendar for a new season ""as soon as possible"". That is despite national clinical director Jason Leitch telling BBC Scotland this morning that fans should ""not write 1 August into their calendars quite yet - there's a long way to go before that"". Following a meeting with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick on Friday, the SPFL suggested that it will start a new season on that date - if Scotland has moved into phase two of its coronavirus recovery. The Scottish FA, meanwhile, suggested a targeted return date of 11 June for player training before the new campaign. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""We need to get back to football, safely, as soon as possible. That is our message and that is our aim."" Celtic urge the SPFL to release the fixture list ""as soon as possible"" before the Scottish Premiership's intended return in August. The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for easing the lockdown. 
Everything is provisional - for instance, there will have to be evidence that Covid-19 transmission is being controlled - but if all goes well, this is what we can expect. On Friday, the country entered the first phase of the Scottish government's four-phase ""route map"" for restarting society while attempting to suppress the virus. Phase two will happen when the virus is considered ""controlled"" and the R-number is consistently below 1. The health service must have adequate capacity and the test, trace and isolate system will be running effectively to suppress transmission. Phase three will happen when the virus is considered ""suppressed"". Many workplaces will have adapted, and the test and trace system will be able to quickly respond to any areas that need particular attention. Life will feel closer to normal. We will finally move into phase four when the virus remains suppressed at very low levels and is no longer considered a significant threat to public health. The government says it could take many months or longer to get to this stage. This video can not be played Lifting lockdown in Scotland: What can we do, and when? Angie BrownBBC Scotland news reporter A mother has told of the heartbreak of seeing her four year old son waving to his father who is unable to get off his ship when it is moored outside their house during the coronavirus lockdown. Seonaid Russell, 34, said it was ""tough"" to watch her son Euan yearn to see his bosun father when he was just 100 metres from their house in Oban. The family live in a cabin which overlooks the town's port. Alasdair Gordon, 41, is an officer in charge of the deck on the Pharos. The ship is responsible for the operation of Scottish lighthouses. Since the lockdown, Alasdair and his crew have been instructed to stay on the ship when it is tied up in the dock. It has meant that when he is moored outside his own house he is not allowed to spend the night with his family as he usually would do. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll have more live coverage tomorrow. In the meantime, here's a reminder of thecurrent rules on social distancing and advice on when to self-isolate. The lockdown has helped mothers get more breastfeeding time due to the extra time at home and fewer visitors, health officials in
Liverpool have said. Ahead
of National Breastfeeding Week on Monday, Matt Ashton, director of public health
in the city, said: âBreastfeeding for even a short period gives children the
best start in life andâ¦ this year we all find ourselves in extraordinary
circumstances, but to hear that many women are finding more time to breastfeed
brings a glimmer of hope to what has been a difficult few months.â Sarah
King, who recently gave birth, said: âBreastfeeding terrified me and I set out
to only do six weeks initially but this time has made me love it and feel super
confident about doing it.â An MP has called for people from outside the
popular Formby coast to âthink twiceâ before visiting its beach. Hundreds have been enjoying the sunshine at the National
Trust reserve in Merseyside, plus at the nearby Crosby beach, although there have been complaints about some
leaving rubbish. Sefton Central MP Bill Esterson said: âThe litter
is a disgrace and I cannot believe people leave litter behind. If they managed
to bring it with them, why can't they just take it all home again? âMany people want to visit the beach from outside
Formby. This is a problem at the best of times and I continue to ask people
from out of area to think twice especially right now about visiting.â Andrew SegalBBC South West A dispersal order has been put on a beach in north Cornwall after ""reports of large gatherings"" on sand dunes, police said. Devon and Cornwall Police's team in Bude said on Facebook the 48-hour order had been put in place on nearby Summerleaze beach after ""substantial litter and mess"" was left behind on Friday. Ch Insp Julian Morris said the order, effective immediately, would let officers disperse ""anyone likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress by their actions or behaviour in Bude town and beaches"". Passengers have started boarding London buses from the front again for the first time since April. Front boardinghad been stopped in light of the coronavirus pandemic to help protect staff. Transport for London says new measures including improvements to screens for drivers means it's now safe to go back to the front-boarding system. Plans to make roads in Southampton city centre traffic-free to help people trying to commute at a safe social distance, have been revealed. Southampton City Council said it plans to close six central roads as part of a six-month trial, which could start as early as the summer. Portland Terrace, Above Bar Street, New Road, Civic Centre Road, London Road and Bellevue Road would close to traffic - except for cyclists, buses, taxis and access for servicing and homes. The measures were announced as part of the authority's Â£4.1m Green Transport Recovery Plan, which comes from existing budgets and money from central government, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Extinction Rebellion has held a series of protests across London. Dozens of people from the environmental protest group gathered in Parliament Square, at the Woolwich Centre and in Richmond. They called for environmental policies to be at the heart of the government's decisions as the country moves out of lockdown. The Met Police said a small number of people had been arrested in relation to breaches of Covid-19 regulations and some Fixed Penalty Notices were issued. The UK government has approved the return of domestic competitive sport behind closed doors from 1 June. The 'phase three' guidancepaves the way for live sport to return for the first time since mid-March. It is up to individual sports to assess the risk and consult athletes, coaches and support staff. Horse racing is among the first to resume with a meeting at Newcastle on Monday, while Premier League football is due to resume on 17 June. Clubs in England's top flight returned to 'phase two' contact training on 25 May. ""The wait is over. Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments,"" said the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Oliver Dowden. BBC Spotlight Any beach that is too busy to allow safe social distancing should not be visited, police in Devon and Cornwall have said. The advice has come as RNLI lifeguard patrolsresumed on seven beaches in the county and one in Devon. Sgt Andy Mulhern said people must follow safety advice. If you can get out, and it's safe, then by all means visit a life-guarded beach. But you have to bear in mind that, if they are crowded, you've got to give it a miss. You've got to protect your family... and that will ultimately save lives."" Sgt Andy Mulhern, Devon and Cornwall Police Daniel ClarkLocal Democracy Reporting Service A councillor has criticised members of the public who have verbally abused staff at Devonâs reopened recycling centres. Devon County Council cabinet member Andrea Davis said the behaviour of a minority of people had been ""appalling and totally unacceptable"" and urged visitors to ""be kind to our key workers, please"". The centres reopened last weekfor essential use onlyto cars without trailers, with a one-in, one-out policy and social distancing measures. The council said the vehicle restrictions were a temporary measure to ensure queues were kept to a minimum and would be reviewed once demand had dropped to ""more manageable levels"". Amy LofthouseBBC Sport The coronavirus pandemic has prevented any cricket being played in England until at least July. The hopes for this summer were that The Hundred would take the women's game to a new audience, alongside a Â£20m investment to fund 40 new professional contracts. That money - described as ""unprecedented"" at the time - was part of a huge Â£50m funding plan aimed at closing the gap between England and Australia at international and domestic level. England had a full international summer planned before they set about defending the 50-over World Cup in February 2021. So what happens now? What cricket will we see this summer? And what next for the women's game? This video can not be played Lockdown measures in England are easing from Monday, but some scientists have  warned the government is lifting restrictions too soon. Epidemic specialist Professor Sian Griffith and Professor Sally Bloomfield, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, have urged the public to remember there are still risks and they will need to be cautious and vigilant. More than 50% of coronavirus patients who underwent surgery suffered from post-operative pulmonary complications, a new study suggests. In the study, published in The Lancet, post-operative pulmonary complications occurred in 51.2% of coronavirus patients who underwent surgery. These complications included conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and/or unexpected postoperative ventilation. Lead author Dr Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Medical teams should consider postponing non-critical procedures and promoting other treatment options, which may delay the need for surgery or sometimes avoid it altogether."" NHS England has announced 146 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The latest figures bring the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,529. Thousands of people in Bristol are without water, or have low pressure, after a water main fractured in the early hours of this morning. Bristol Water said the burst on Royate Hill was affecting customers in the BS5, BS6, BS7, BS9, BS15 and BS16 areas. It said the repair was ""trickier than first thought"" butengineers had restored supplies to some peopleby rerouting the network. The firm is working with the council to distribute bottled water while maintaining social distancing. Messages thanking waste collectors in County Durham have gone on show on the side of bin wagons. The County Council said that bin crews had been ""inundated"" with drawings and letters of appreciation from residents which had helped lift spirits while they have been carrying out collections. Some of the drawings have now been blown up and displayed on three of the vehicles. Councillor Brian Stephens, cabinet member for neighbourhoods and local partnerships, said: ""These displays of gratitude for our bin crews really do highlight that good work does not go unnoticed, and that a small gesture, such as a small thank you note, can make a big difference."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of public order offences after fighting broke out at a birthday party, Lancashire Police said. Officers said they were âmet by a barrage of abuseâ after being called to reports of a gathering that âgot out of handâ at Dunnyshop Avenue, Accrington in the early hours of this morning. âPeople who organise or attend any of these sorts of events will be dealt with accordingly as Covid fines can still be issued to anyone in breach of the rules,"" a spokesperson for the force said. This video can not be played âWhy I recreated my local pub in virtual realityâ The coronavirus lockdown has seen pubs and bars closed in England but one man has missed his local so much that he decided to recreate it in virtual reality. Tristan Cross taught himself how to make the 3D models by watching videos on YouTube. It took him two and half weeks to create the virtual environment. The Lake District National Park Authority has urged visitors to show ""care and consideration"" for everyone who lives and works in the area. With the good weather expected to bring an influx of visitors, they are asking people not to flout social distancing rules. It is feared ""hot spot"" areas such as Windermere, Ambleside, Glenridding and Devilâs Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale could become overwhelmed and people are being advised to avoid them. Visitors are also being reminded there is a ban on overnight camping and cafes remain closed. If you do visit, please use a car park, plan ahead, donât light barbecues and take your litter home when you leave."" Richard Leafe, Chief executive, Lake District National Park Authority A water company has apologised after there was ""low pressure and/or no supply in a number of areas"". Severn Trent said yesterday was another day of ""incredibly high demand for treated water"" across pretty much its entire area - almost reaching its highest ever level and finishing at 2.275bn litres. The Coventry-based company said it knew ""just how difficult it must be with the heat and with
everyone needing to wash their hands... during the
coronavirus crisis"". Areas affected included Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, Knaptoft in Leicestershire, Rugby in Warwickshire, Much Wenlock in Shropshire and Bushbury in Wolverhampton. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Virus-hit self-employed to receive second paymentApplications for a ""second and final"" grant of up to Â£6,570 will open in August, the chancellor says.BusinessComments","Self-employed people can apply for a second lump sum in August Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says. More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to Â£7,500 so far. They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to Â£6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. It comes as details of theextended furlough schemewere also outlined. Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment. Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling Â£6.8bn. Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July. At the government's daily press conference,Mr Sunakhas now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August. This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second. Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says it has been tough One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown. She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues. ""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said. ""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts."" Full details of help for the self-employed Hardship risk 'could undermine test and trace system' The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed. It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"". Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months. That scheme has been extended until October. The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come. He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments. A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.
