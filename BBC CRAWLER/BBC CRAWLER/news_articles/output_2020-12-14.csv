New Uighur cotton evidence 'game-changer' for fashion brands," By John Sudworth By John Sudworth Alongside a large network of detention camps, in which more than a million are thought to have been detained, allegations that minority groups are being coerced into working in textile factories have already been well documented. The Chinese government denies the claims, insisting that the camps are “vocational training schools” and the factories are part of a massive, and voluntary, “poverty alleviation” scheme. But the new evidence suggests that upwards of half a million minority workers a year are also being marshalled into seasonal cotton picking under conditions that again appear to raise a high risk of coercion. “In my view the implications are truly on a historical scale,” Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washingtonwho uncovered the documents, told the BBC. “For the first time we not only have evidence of Uighur forced labour in manufacturing, in garment making, it’s directly about the picking of cotton, and I think that is such a game-changer. “Anyone who cares about ethical sourcing has to look at Xinjiang, which is 85% of China’s cotton and 20% of the world’s cotton, and say, ‘We can’t do this anymore.’” The documents, a mixture of online government policy papers and state news reports, show that in 2018 the prefectures of Aksu and Hotan sent 210,000 workers “via labour transfer” to pick cotton for a Chinese paramilitary organisation, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Others speak of pickers being “mobilised and organised” and transported to fields hundreds of kilometres away. This year, Aksu identified a need for 142,700 workers for its own fields, which was largely met through the principle of “transferring all those who should be transferred.” References to “guiding” the pickers to “consciously resist illegal religious activities” indicate that the policies are designed predominantly for Xinjiang’s Uighurs and other traditionally Muslim groups. Government officials first sign “contracts of intent” with the cotton farms, determining the “number of workers hired, the location, the accommodation and wages,” after which pickers are then mobilised to “enthusiastically sign up”. There are plenty of clues that this enthusiasm is less than whole-hearted. One report describes a village where people were “unwilling to work in agriculture”. Officials had to visit again to perform “thought education work”. Eventually 20 were sent off, with a plan in place to “export” 60 more. China has long used the mass relocation of its rural poor - with the stated aim of improving their employment prospects - as part of a national anti-poverty campaign. In recent years, those efforts have gone into overdrive. Arguably President Xi Jinping’s most important domestic political priority, the goal is to eliminate absolute poverty in time for the Communist Party’s centenary next year. But in Xinjiang there is evidence of a far more political purpose and much higher levels of control, as well as massivetargets and quotaswhich officials are under pressure to meet. A marked shift in China’s approach to the region can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014, blamed by China on Uighur Islamists and separatists. Its response, from 2016 onwards, has been the building of“re-education”campsfor anyone displaying any behaviour viewed as a potential sign of untrustworthiness, such as installing an encrypted messaging app on a phone, viewing religious content or having a relative living overseas. While China calls them “schools for de-radicalisation”,its own recordssuggest that the reality is a draconian system of internment which aims to replace old identities of faith and culture with an enforced loyalty to the Communist Party. But the construction work didn’t stop with the camps. Since 2018, a huge industrial expansion has been under way involving the building of hundreds of factories. The parallel purpose of mass employment and mass internment is made clear by the appearance of many factories within the walls of the camps, or in close proximity to them. Work, the government appears to believe, will help transform the“outdated ideas”of Xinjiang’s minorities and remake them as modern, secular, wage-earning Chinese citizens. This facility built in 2017 in the city of Kuqa, has been identified as a re-education camp by researchers Open-source satellite images show internal security walls and what appears to be a guard tower. A new factory appeared next door in 2018. Shortly after construction finished, the satellite picked up something significant. Independent analysts confirm that masses of people, all apparently wearing the same colour uniforms, can be seen walking in close formation between the two sites. When the BBC tried to visit, a number of unmarked cars followed us as we filmed the perimeter of the complex. The factory and the camp now appear to have been amalgamated into one large factory complex, plastered with propaganda slogans extolling the benefits of the anti-poverty campaign. Before long we were stopped from filming and forced to leave. According to local state-run media, the textile factory employs up to 3000 people “under the mobilisation and organisation of the government”. But it’s impossible to verify who the people in the satellite image are or what the conditions for the workers in the facility are like today. Questions sent directly to the factory have gone unanswered. The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang Despite the link between camps and factories, it is mostly those who haven’t been detained who are themain targetsof Xinjiang’s poverty alleviation campaign. Often from poor farming or herding families, more than two million of them have been mobilised for work, in many cases after first being put through short bouts of “military-style” job training. So far, the available evidence suggests that, like the camp inmates, they too have been used as a source of labour in factories and, in particular, Xinjiang’s booming textile mills. In July this year, the US based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)concludedthat it was “possible” that minorities were also being sent to pick cotton, but “more information is needed.” The new documents found by Dr Zenz not only provide that information, they also reveal a clear political purpose behind this mass transfer of minorities into the fields. An August 2016 notice issued by the Xinjiang regional government on the management of cotton pickers instructs officials to “strengthen their ideological education and ethnic unity education”. One propaganda report found by Dr Zenz suggests that the cotton fields present an opportunity to transform the “deep-rooted, lazy thinking” of poor, rural villagers by showing them that “labour is glorious”. Such phrases echo the Chinese state’s view of Uighurlifestyles and customsas acting as a barrier to modernisation. A desire to stay home and “bring up children” is described as an “important cause of poverty” by another propaganda report about the benefits of cotton picking. The state is providing “centralised” systems of care for children, the elderly and for livestock, so that everyone is “freed from the worries of going out to work.” And there are many references to how the mobilised cotton pickers are subject to controls and surveillance seemingly at odds with any normal employment practice. A policy document from Aksu, dated October this year, decrees that cotton pickers must be transported in groups and accompanied by officials who “eat, live, study and work with them, actively implementing thought education during cotton picking”. Mahmut, not his real name, is a young Uighur now living in Europe who cannot return to Xinjiang because a history of overseas travel is one of the main reasons for internment in a camp. Contact with his family back home is also now far too risky for them. But when they last spoke in 2018 he heard that both his mother and sister had been transferred to work. “They took my sister to Aksu City, to a textile factory,” he tells me. “She stayed in that factory for three months and didn’t get any money. “In winter, my mother was picking cotton for government officials - they say they need five or ten per cent of the village, they come to every family door by door. “People go because they’re afraid of being taken to jail or somewhere else.” Over the past five years, these door-to-door visits have become a key mechanism of control in Xinjiang, with 350,000 officials despatched to gather detailed, intrusive information on every single minority household. Those being called to work by these “village-based work teams” will be only too aware that they are also instrumental in deciding who should be sent to a camp. Xinjiang’s cotton growing industry used to rely on seasonal, migrant workers from other provinces in China. But cotton picking is notoriously hard work and rising wages and better jobs elsewhere mean the migrants have stopped coming. Now propaganda reports write glowingly of how the newly found supply of local labour has both solved this labour crisis and helped increase profits for the growers. But nowhere is there any real explanation of why hundreds of thousands of people, who apparently had no previous interest in picking cotton, should suddenly rush into the fields. Although the documents claim that pay levels can top 5000 RMB ($763, £570) a month, one report appears to suggest that for 132 pickers organised from one village, the average monthly salary was just 1,670 RMB ($255, £188)) each. Whatever the salary level, paid labour can still be considered forced labour under the relevantinternational convention. In response to questions submitted to China’s foreign ministry, the BBC received a faxed statement saying: “Workers from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang choose their jobs according to their own free will and sign voluntary employment contracts in accordance with the law.” Xinjiang’s poverty rate has fallen from almost 20% in 2014 to a little more than 1% today, it said. And it dismissed accusations of forced labour as “completely fabricated”, saying instead that China’s critics wanted to cause “forced unemployment and forced poverty” in Xinjiang. “The smiling faces of all of Xinjiang’s ethnic groups are the most powerful response to America’s lies and rumours,” it added. But the Better Cotton Initiative, an independent industry body that promotes ethical and sustainable standards, told the BBC that concerns over China’s poverty alleviation scheme were one of the main reasons they’ve recently decided to stop auditing and certifying farms in Xinjiang. Director of standards and assurance, Damien Sanfilippo, said: “We’ve identified the risk that poor, rural communities would be coerced into employment linked to this poverty alleviation programme. “Even if these workers get a decent wage – which is possible – they may not have chosen that employment freely.” Mr Sanfilippo, who also cited the increasingly restricted access to Xinjiang for his international monitors as another factor, said the organisation’s decision to walk away only further raises the risk for the global fashion industry. “To the best of my knowledge there isn’t any organisation that is active locally who can provide verification for that cotton.” The BBC approached 30 major international brands. Three – Marks and Spencer, Next, and Tesco – told us they have policies in place that ensure products sourced from China do not use raw cotton from Xinjiang. Burberry said they do not use any cotton from China at all. Others, including those who don't source direct from Xinjiang, were unable to guarantee its cotton didn't enter supply chains elsewhere. Nine companies gave no response. As we prepare to leave Xinjiang, just outside the city of Korla we pass a location that was, as recently as 2015, a patch of open desert. It is now home to a giant, prison camp complex, with what independent analysts say are multiple factory buildings visible inside.  We believe this is the first independent footage of the colossal site. It is just one of many such complexes that now dot the landscape, and a chilling final reminder of the blurred boundaries between mass incarceration and mass labour in Xinjiang.

UK and EU restart trade talks after leaders' call,"Michel Barnier is leading the EU's negotiating team in Monday's talks UK and EU negotiators have restarted talks over a post-Brexit trade deal in hope of securing an agreement. It comes after the two sides confirmed on Sunday there had been enough progress for negotiations to continue. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday there had been ""movement"" in the talks and negotiators had not exhausted all options. But a UK government source later said there had not been ""significant progress in recent days"". Time is fast running out to finalise an agreement before the UK's Brexit transition ends in just over two weeks. The decision to keep talking came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the main sticking points with President Von der Leyen on Sunday. Negotiations will continue in Brussels on Tuesday, but a new deadline for a decision has not been set. The ultimate deadline comes on 31 December, however, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? Pound gains after EU trade talks extended Without a trade deal in place by then, the two sides would begin trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, meaning taxes - or tariffs - would be introduced, potentially raising the cost of imported goods such as food. Fishing rights, ""level playing field"" rules on how far the UK should be able to diverge from EU laws, and how any agreement should be policed remain the major stumbling blocks. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has resumed talks with his UK counterpart Lord Frost, after briefing ambassadors of EU member states. According to an EU source, Mr Barnier is believed to have told them talks over a level playing field remained hard, but were moving towards an agreement. He is also said to have told them a wider deal could fall into place if a route towards an agreement on fishing rights can be identified. But a UK government source later downplayed progress, saying: ""Talks remain difficult and we have not made significant progress in recent days, despite efforts by the UK side to bring energy and ideas to the process."" Lord Frost has said a deal is only possible if it ""fully respects UK sovereignty"". Speaking at an event on Monday, Mrs von der Leyen said the issue of the level playing field was the ""one and only important question"" if UK should continue to have access to the EU's single market. The EU Commission president added: ""They have either to play by our rules, because this is a matter of fairness for our companies... or the other choice is there is a price on it, and the price is border and tariffs."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the continuation of the talks and said the worst outcome would be to ""crash out with no deal whatsoever on 1 January"". This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We want a level playing field not only at the start, but also over time"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? This new phase of the talks is expected to focus on how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. The EU is reported to have dropped the idea of a formal mechanism to ensure both sides keep up with each other's standards and is now prepared to accept UK divergence - provided there are safeguards to prevent unfair competition. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. What does it mean in Brexit trade deal terms ""to go the extra mile""? That's the distance the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, have promised to travel over the next days. But will the road take them to deal or no-deal? And who will compromise on what to get there? EU contacts close to the talks say both sides are being constructive. They insist negotiations aren't simply continuing because neither the EU, nor the government want to be blamed in a no-deal scenario and prefer not to walk away first. Remember: what's said in front of the cameras is only part of the picture. We aren't behind the scenes in the negotiating room or on the closed calls between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen. But however long these talks rumble on, ultimately neither the government, nor the EU, will sign up to a deal if they can't claim it as a victory. Read more from Katya here. The National Farmers' Union has warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. And the British Retail Consortium warned the public would face ""over Â£3bn in food tariffs [meaning] retailers would have no choice but to pass on some of these additional costs to their customers"".

"All Windrush victims to get at least Â£10,000","This video can not be played Priti Patel says she âalways promised to listen and actâ and that it was her mission to âcorrect the wrongs of the pastâ. The government is to give more money to victims of the Windrush scandal, which saw hundreds of people wrongly threatened with deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the minimum payment will rise from Â£250 to Â£10,000, and the maximum from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000. The figure will be higher still in ""exceptional"" circumstances, with money coming through quicker than before. The Windrush scandal mainly affected UK citizens originally from the Caribbean. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when ""hostile environment"" immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under then Home Secretary Theresa May. UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? The scandal broke in 2018, including the revelation that many of those affected had lost homes and jobs and had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The BBC's Westminster Hour reported last month that at least nine people had died while awaiting payments under the compensation scheme set up for victims. By Jack Fenwick, Westminster Hour Campaigners for the Windrush victims are likely to ask why this announcement by the home secretary didn't come sooner. The government acted quickly in setting up the Windrush Compensation Scheme when the scandal became public in 2018, but that scheme has long been criticised for being too slow and resulting in offers some say are too low. The speed at which claims are processed and money is offered is seen as being particularly crucial, given that many of those affected are elderly. The additional announcement that the compensation process for loss of earnings will also change could potentially lead to even larger payouts for victims. Early responses from claimants suggest a sense of cautious optimism at the latest announcement, with one person telling me they won't believe it until a cheque is in the post. The Windrush Compensation Scheme will be updated following consultation with the Windrush Working Group, chaired by Bishop Derek Webley. Ms Patel told the House of Commons there would be ""substantial changes"". She added that these would ""make a real difference to people's lives"", saying: ""I've always promised to listen and act to ensure that the victims of Windrush receive the maximum amount of compensation they deserve. ""It's my mission to correct the wrongs of the past and I will continue to work with the Windrush Working Group to do exactly that."" The changes to the scheme will apply retrospectively, meaning those previously given less than Â£10,000 will receive top-up payments. The Home Office is also removing the 12 months' salary limit on compensation for earnings lost by people forced out of their jobs. It will start letting those affected by the changes know from next week. Bishop Webley said: ""Many will benefit from the relief that these new payments will provide, and begin to move forward with their lives with hope and determination."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report last month said government action taken to ""record and respond to negative equality impacts"" of hostile environment immigration policies had been ""perfunctory, and therefore insufficient"". It called for a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"", with the commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, describing the treatment of the Windrush generation as ""a shameful stain on British history"". The Windrush compensation scheme came into force last year, with Â£2m being paid out so far and a further Â£1m offered.

Man who 'begged' for MRI scan dies from cancer,"LaTroya Hall (left) said she had been ""devastated"" by the death of her husband Sherwin A man who had to ""beg"" to get an MRI scan because of the Covid-19 crisis has died of cancer, his family have said. Sherwin Hall, 27, from Leeds, first went to hospital on 23 March suffering leg pain but was misdiagnosed and sent away with a course of antibiotics. After 13 visits in four weeks a scan on 26 May revealed a tumour in his pelvis and 30 small tumours on his lungs. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it had maintained scanning for all ""urgent interventions"". Mr Hall's wife LaTroya said had his cancer been found sooner ""it is likely he would still be here today"". Before his death, Mr Hall said he ""kept begging"" for a scan but was told services had been ""slowed down because of the coronavirus"". In July, he featured in a special BBC Panorama programmeBritain's Cancer Crisis. More news from across Yorkshire Sherwin Hall made 13 hospital visits before he was given an MRI scan Mrs Hall, who is being supported by the Catch Up With Cancer Campaign, said she was ""devastated"" and had ""lost the love of my life"". The campaign was launched by the parents ofMacclesfield beautician Kelly Smith who died after her treatment for bowel cancer was stopped as a result of the pandemic. Mrs Hall said: ""It worries me that the government and NHS leaders continue to say cancer services are back to normal; our family's experience has been that, even now, this is simply not the case. ""Even if services were back at pre-pandemic levels, that is not enough. The cancer backlog also needs to be cleared."" Cancer charity Macmillan Cancer Support estimated there was a backlog of 50,000 people living with undiagnosed cancer across the UK as a result of the pandemic. A spokeswoman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr Hall's family at this very difficult time."" She said the trust had maintained scanning for all ""urgent interventions"" throughout the pandemic and had operated in accordance with Nice guidelines. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said cancer diagnosis and treatment had ""remained a priority"" during the pandemic and said the government had given Â£3bn to tackle the impact of Covid.

Easing Christmas Covid rules 'makes no sense',"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"". But Mr Gething fears people would ""make up their own rules"" if meeting up over Christmas was banned. Wales has thehighest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK- a seven-day average of 425 cases per 100,000 - and eight of the UK's top 10 worst infected areas are in Wales with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend the top three. In a letter to the health minister, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman Dr Richard Pugh warns critical care services will not be able to cope over the winter period without intervention ""at the highest level"". Christmas five-day relaxation period 'a mistake' How do Wales Covid cases compare to other nations? Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients Up to three households can stay together and form a""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, all four UK nations have agreed. But the body representing intensive care staff want that decision reviewed amid fears it will cause a surge in cases. ""Christmas is a special time but it seems a very, very difficult thing to justify,"" said Dr Pugh. ""It makes no sense viewed from a perspective of front-line staff and public health."" With 190 critical care beds already being used - almost half by coronavirus patients - Dr Pugh said critical care was already over-capacity. ""Welsh critical care services will be unable to manage rising demands relating to Covid-19, to maintain emergency non-Covid activity, and to continue providing peri-operative care for high risk urgent surgical cases in coming weeks without intervention at the highest level,"" he said. Two health boards in south Wales have already cancelled some non-urgent care - Swansea Bay andAneurin Bevan University Health Boards. This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Ambulances waited for the equivalent of a week to deliver sick patients to hospital staff at the new Â£350m Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran on Saturday. On Sunday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board apologised after a73-year-old man waited more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside that hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service said more than 10 patients had waited more than 12 hours in ambulances outside hospitals awaiting beds in the last week. The family of Ted Edwards from Monmouthshire said he waited for 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital The service has raised its alert system to its highest level, which signals ""extreme pressure"". ""We've seen more Covid-related patients in the last six weeks than than we've seen since March,"" chief executive Jason Killenstold BBC Radio Wales. ""We've more staff off sick or self-isolating since April and we've seen some of our busiest days this year in the last 10 days, with four of the last five days the busiest since the start of the pandemic."" Added to ""congestion"" outside hospital A&E departments, Mr Killen apologised as ambulance crews had ""real difficulties being able to respond in a timely way, particularly to less serious patients"". Dr Pugh said there was now a case for the cancellation of elective surgery to happen on a ""national basis"" to allow the NHS to be able to treat new patients as coronavirus cases increased. He said that while imposing more stringent rules ahead of the festive period was difficult, the impact of lockdowns took weeks to help departments. ""Viewed from a front-line perspective, I am afraid we do not have the luxury of deferring such steps until after the Christmas period,"" added the intensive care consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire. Morriston Hospital will be one of those in Swansea only treating urgent cases Mr Gething said the situation across Wales was ""very serious"" but added it was not Wales' ""preference"" to break the Christmas rule relaxation. ""There is a lot of capital invested in that easing of the rules which all four countries signed up to,"" he said. Mr Gething said officials were now working with hospitals to look at how to send patients who were no longer infectious - especially the elderly - home. The seven-day case rate for Swansea Bay Health Board area, which treats patients in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea, now stands at 770.3 per 100,000 people. It has the second highest rate for any of the board areas in Wales, behind Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board on 870.3. There were also more than 250 Covid patients in Swansea Bay hospitals, with another 115 recovering patients. This is about a third of all patients. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned the Welsh NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"" whenthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Waleson Saturday. Mr Gething said the Welsh NHS had experienced one of its busiest weekends of 2020 as it dealt with a combination of rising Covid cases and winter pressures. He urged people to abide by rules and regulations, adding: ""We need everyone's help to get through what remains of this year."" Covid-19 patients make up nearly 26% of all patients in hospital with 1,992 people in hospital across Wales on Sunday. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant at the new Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, warned the hospital was ""stuffed full with patients with very significant needs"". ""We have reached a tipping point, we have more patients that have Covid than don't have Covid now,"" she said. Dr Sarah Aitken, the health board's interim executive medical director, said there were now 404 patients with confirmed coronavirus in its hospitals - compared to 283 in April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England,"A new variant of coronavirus has been found which is growing faster in some parts of England, MPs have been told. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at least 60 different local authorities had recorded Covid infections caused by the new variant. He said the World Health Organization had been notified and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. He said there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. This video can not be played A new variant of Covid could be speeding up the spread of cases in parts of south east England, says Matt Hancock. He told MPs in the House of Commons that over the last week, there had been sharp, exponential rises in coronavirus infections across London, Kent, parts of Essex and Hertfordshire. ""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the South of England although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. ""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."" England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said current coronavirus swab tests would detect the new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas in recent weeks. The changes or mutations involve the spike protein of the virus - the part that helps it infect cells, and the target Covid vaccines are designed around. It is too soon to know exactly what this will do to the behaviour of the virus. Prof Alan McNally, an expert at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC: ""Let's not be hysterical. It doesn't mean it's more transmissible or more infectious or dangerous. ""It is something to keep an eye on. ""Huge efforts are ongoing at characterising the variant and understanding its emergence. It is important to keep a calm and rational perspective on the strain as this is normal virus evolution and we expect new variants to come and go and emerge over time."" Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said it was potentially serious. ""The surveillance and research must continue and we must take the necessary steps to stay ahead of the virus."" There is a simple rule for understanding all ""new strain"" or ""new variants"": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the ""scare"" but not the ""answer"". Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England. This is not the same as saying it ""is causing"" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily. New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is. Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at Nottingham University, said: ""The genetic information in many viruses can change very rapidly and sometimes these changes can benefit the virus - by allowing it to transmit more efficiently or to escape from vaccines or treatments - but many changes have no effect at all. ""Even though a new genetic variant of the virus has emerged and is spreading in many parts of the UK and across the world, this can happen purely by chance. ""Therefore, it is important that we study any genetic changes as they occur, to work out if they are affecting how the virus behaves, and until we have done that important work it is premature to make any claims about the potential impacts of virus mutation.""

Greenwich Council ordered to keep schools open,"Greenwich Council has asked all schools to move to online learning amid rising Covid cases The government has told a London council it must keep schools open or face legal action. Greenwich Council hadwritten to head teachersasking all schools to move classes online from Tuesday amid rising Covid-19 cases. On Monday evening, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered the south-east London council to keep schools open. He said: ""Using legal powers is a last resort but continuity of education is a national priority."" Ofsted said it was right to keep schools open as children were ""suffering"" from ""yo-yoing in and out of school"", while parents criticised the timings of the announcements and questioned the politics behind the move. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into England's highest tier of Covid restrictions on Wednesday due to a rise in infections. Schools in England were told theycould close a day earlyfor Christmas last week to give staff a ""proper break"" from identifying potential coronavirus cases. In Basildon, where the third-highest Covid rate was recorded, schoolswere also allowed to close early, while London's mayor Sadiq Khan has called on secondary schools and colleges in the capital to follow suit. Millions more to enter tier 3 Covid rules But Mr Williamson said the decision by councils in Greenwich, and also Islington in north London and Waltham Forest in east London, was ""not in children's best interests"". He added: ""That's why I won't hesitate to do what is right for young people and have issued a direction to Greenwich Council setting out that they must withdraw the letter issued to head teachers on Sunday."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was ""vital"" children remained in school until the end of term Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman described it as a ""really difficult situation"" in which people were ""weighing up short-term concerns about health risks and long-term concerns about children's education"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's so easy to call for closures and forget the long-term price which children pay which our visits show so clearly. ""We've had children yo-yoing in and out of school through the autumn and really suffering as a result. We need clarity, consistency, not last minute decisions."" Covid: Will schools close early for Christmas? Will there be mass testing at your child's school? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? In a letter sent on Sunday, Greenwich Council leader Danny Thorpe asked all schools to move the majority of pupils to remote learning but said buildings would remain open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. The regional schools commissioner, who acts on behalf of the education secretary, told the council that new powers introduced under the Coronavirus Act allowed the secretary of state to issue ""directions"" to require schools to enable all pupils to attend school full-time. The Department for Education (DfE) said no decisions had been taken yet about what action to take against all three Labour-run councils. Sadiq Khan wants all students to be tested for Covid-19 Greenwich Council had until 10:00 GMT on Tuesday to retract its letter and had said it would seek legal advice before responding. Mr Thorpe previously said changing plans already in place before Tuesday would have been ""impossible"". ""Schools across the borough have now organised online learning from tomorrow (Tuesday), whilst others are opening their premises to all pupils,"" he said. ""We have alerted schools and will speak to them tomorrow. But given we received this notification just before 17:00 GMT, it was impossible to ask schools to change any of the arrangements they have in place for Tuesday."" The leader of Islington Council said in a tweet that the authority was recommending moving to online teaching. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Khan has called for more testing in schools, citing a 75% increase in children aged between 10-19 testing positive for the virus. He told the Today programme councils should speak to the DofE to avoid court action and described how parents were pulling children out of school either because they had been part of bubble that had to self-isolate, or because they wanted 10 days to self-isolate before seeing grandparents at Christmas. ""In the absence of community testing in schools, many children - despite the heroic efforts of teachers - could have the virus and not know about it,"" he said. ""And these very same children next week will be hugging and kissing granny because the rules are being relaxed so we're going from tier 2, to tier 3, to tier 0, and back to tier 3 in advance of another potentially national lockdown in January."" On Monday, the reaction was mixed among parents outside Robert Owen Nursery School and Christ Church Church of England Primary School, both in Greenwich. One mother said: ""It's 2.5 days, so I don't see what difference this is really going to make and I think the timing of it is really, really bad. ""I'm on maternity at the moment but if I was working, it's just too short notice to get any kind of childcare arrangements in place."" And a father added: ""I think the timing might be right as a lot of people will be gathering for Christmas and it takes 10 to 14 days to show up so it may be damage limitation. ""I hope it will have an impact. If not, then it's just political."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story.

Biden victory formalised after electors cast votes,"This video can not be played Electoral college affirms Joe Biden as president-elect Members of the US electoral college have affirmed Joe Biden's presidential election victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office. The Democrat won November's contest with 306 electoral college votes to Republican Donald Trump's 232. Under the US system, voters actually cast their ballots for ""electors"", who in turn, formally vote for candidates weeks after the election. Despite this process, President Trump is not expected to accept the result. Normally the electors do not get that much attention but this year, due to Mr Trump's persistent efforts to question and overturn the results - involving legal challenges which have been rejected by courts across the country - the state-by-state vote was in the spotlight. Can Trump still challenge the result? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to vote on Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state which Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college The vote at the capitol building went ahead peacefully although a group of Republicans tried to enter the building to hold their own vote and were turned away. ""The people have spoken. It was a safe, fair and secure election,"" said Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who had been the subject ofa kidnapping plot thwarted by the FBI earlier this year.""After today, the results will be final."" Each political party with a candidate on the presidential ballot nominates or votes on its own slate of electors in the months prior to election day. Once we know who won a state's popular vote, we know which party will appoint the electors for that state. The US Constitution only states that electors cannot be members of Congress or others who currently hold federal office. This year, the most famous electors are former President Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, chosen for the Democrats in New York. This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? Electors almost always vote in line with their pledged candidate, although in 2016 some did not and this prompted states to change their laws to try and prevent a recurrence. Analysts say there is next to no chance that Mr Biden's victory could be overturned. Read more:The people who ultimately pick the US president The number of electors per state is roughly in line with the size of the population. The results of the voting process will be sent to Washington DC and formally counted in a joint session of Congress on 6 January presided over by Vice-President Mike Pence. That will pave the way for Joe Biden to be sworn in as president on 20 January. Mr Biden plans to address the nation on Monday evening after the electors have voted, his transition team has announced. He is expected to say that democracy has ""prevailed"" in the United States, adding: ""The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago. And we now know that nothing - not even a pandemic - or an abuse of power - can extinguish that flame."" Last month, President Trump said he would leave office in January if Mr Biden were affirmed as the election winner by the electoral college. Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and there are few signs he will concede. The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, has given the proceedings new attention. Although his legal team has had little success in challenging the results of the vote in multiple battleground states, the official recording of the electoral college ballots across the US will effectively lower the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. It is holding alternative electoral college proceedings with an alternate set of votes that will declare the president the real winner. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally will have been duly certified by the states on Monday and federal law is on Mr Biden's side. Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Wales already breaching part of lockdown criteria,"The Welsh Government is publishing a new four-tier alert system Wales is already in breach of some of the key indicators used to determine future lockdowns. The first minister saida lockdown could be introduced after Christmasif rates do not begin to fall. But Wales' current case rates and rate of positive tests currently exceed indicators that would be considered. The Welsh Government has said it is unlikely to introduce further restrictions before the five-day Christmas period. The indicators are part of the Welsh Government's new four-level system of Covid-19 restrictions, laid out in a new 'Coronavirus Control Plan' published on Monday. Wales is currently in level three and restrictions equivalent to a lockdown would be brought in if the alert level was raised to four. Schools and places of worship will remain open and non-essential retail closed, although click-and-collect would be allowed. Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insists The plan said the vaccine programme offers a ""glimmer of hope"" but that safety measures and rules will have to be in place well into 2021. Indicators to determine which level of restrictions are required ""are not mechanical thresholds - they are broad principles, which will be used to inform balanced judgments"". Some of the key indicators to judge whether Wales needs to move to level four restrictions, include a confirmed seven-day case rate of more than 300 cases per 100,000 people and test positivity above 10% over seven days. In the seven days until 9 December, Wales had a case rate of 450.4 and a test positivity rate of 19.5%, according to Public Health Wales' figures. Care home vaccination pilot to start in Wales Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests Further 33 deaths from Covid and 1,228 new cases Concerns over hospital capacity is also a key indicators for alert level four. Two of Wales' seven local health boards - Swansea Bay University and Aneurin Bevan Health Board - havesuspendedsome non-urgent care in response to increased coronavirus cases. Pubs would be closed under level 4 The Welsh Intensive Care Society has saidcritical care would be unable to copein the coming weeks without ""intervention at the highest level"". But the Welsh Government has said it is unlikely to introduce any further restrictions before the five-day Christmas period, from 23 to 27 December, when up to three households will be able to stay together. Its new paper outlines that the ""severity"" of level four restrictions ""make it suitable for shorter periods to provide a short, sharp shock before the situation necessitates a longer period of time"" in lockdown. The plan adds that ""intervening early is more effective and that time-limited interventions are likely to be more effective than open-ended restrictions with no end date."" Wales could move up more than one level, for example, from level one to level three, but would only move down one level at a time and would take a number of weeks. The four levels of restrictions will initially be implemented across the whole of Wales but there could be regional or localised differences if the evidence points to sustained differences between areas. The plan was criticised by Joseph Carter, Head of Asthma UK & British Lung Foundation Wales, who said it provided ""no detail"" about the support for people who are extremely clinically vulnerable. Ashley Rogers, the commercial director of the North Wales Business Council, said the new alert levels were a step in the right direction but said criteria for a regional approach was vague. The Welsh Government paper outlines the kind of restrictions that could be implemented in each level. Mark Drakeford has warned of a possible lockdown after Christmas Up to six adults could meet in a private house or garden, or in a cafÃ© or restaurant. The restrictions don't apply to those under 11. No more than 30 people could meet outdoors in a public space. but if the alert level to four Up to 50 people could attend organised indoor events and 100 people to an outdoor event, while stadia could also open for sporting events. There is still a 10pm curfew on hospitality but there is no restriction on when food can be served. All indoor and outdoor entertainment and leisure venues can open too, with the exception of nightclubs. Weddings, civil partnerships and funerals can take place with restrictions on numbers, depending on the venue, but the indoor and outdoor limit on numbers. Only four from up to four different households can meet in pub, cafe or restaurant, or in a private garden. Only extended households can meet indoors. In outdoor public places the rule of four stands except for when an extended household meets up. Hospitality businesses can open until 10pm and serve alcohol with a substantial meal. Cinemas and indoor visitor attractions such as museums can open and venues can open to begin piloting events. Travel to areas of high prevalence would not be allowed but there are no restrictions on international travel beyond having to quarantine upon return from certain destinations. Ice-skating rinks would remain closed. Restrictions would be similar to what we have now. You can only mix in private houses with your extended household or support bubble. You can, however, meet with four people from different households in a cafÃ© or restaurant. Hospitality businesses cannot serve alcohol and must close at 6pm but non-essential shops, hairdressers, beauty salons, gyms and holiday accommodation remain open. Travelling is not allowed to areas of high prevalence and international travel is not advised. Up to 30 people can meet for organised exercise outside, like a fitness class, but only 15 can do so inside. The restrictions do not apply to restrictions for children. Wedding ceremonies and funerals can take place with limited numbers set by the venue but at this level, receptions can also take place with 15 people indoors and 30 outdoors. The public would be required to stay at home and only mix with their household or support bubble. Travelling would only by allowed for essential purposes, such as for work and for caring responsibilities. International travel would not be allowed. All indoor and outdoor events and visitor attractions would be cancelled or closed. Non-essential shops would close as would gyms,Â hairdressers, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation. Wedding ceremonies and funerals can take place with limited numbers, but no receptions or wakes can occur. Schools however would remain open.

Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to vote on Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state which Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence.

Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and there are few signs he will concede. The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, has given the proceedings new attention. Although his legal team has had little success in challenging the results of the vote in multiple battleground states, the official recording of the electoral college ballots across the US will effectively lower the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. It is holding alternative electoral college proceedings with an alternate set of votes that will declare the president the real winner. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally will have been duly certified by the states on Monday and federal law is on Mr Biden's side. Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Scots told to 'cut down contacts' before Christmas,"Scots have been urged to ""cut down on unnecessary contacts"" now if they plan to meet up with relatives at Christmas. Rules on household meetings are being eased for five days over the festive period, allowing up to eight people from three households to meet indoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those who choose to do this should cut contacts now to be as safe as possible. She said the ""best Christmas gift we can give family and friends"" is to ""keep our distance and keep them safe"". Ms Sturgeon also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present a ""real risk of transmission"". First care home resident receives vaccine Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Peoplewill be allowed to form Christmas ""bubbles""of three households between 23 and 27 December. Ms Sturgeon said this was a ""pragmatic step"" to make the festive period ""as safe as possible"" for those who feel they must meet up - but has repeatedly urged people not to do it unless absolutely necessary. At her coronavirus briefing on Monday, the first minister said Christmas might be ""the toughest"" point of the pandemic for many, but she added that people In Scotland should ""think really carefully"" about gathering indoors. She said: ""Hopefully next year this will all be a bad memory and we'll be looking forward to a much more normal Christmas. ""What we should be thinking about this Christmas is about ensuring that everyone we love is still there when we get to next Christmas, and that we're not losing more people to Covid along the way."" Ms Sturgeon said people planning to meet up should ""reduce unnecessary contacts between now and then"", particularly if they will be seeing elderly relatives. She suggested people avoid catching up with friends in cafes or car-sharing in the run-up to Christmas. The first minister said: ""By taking precautions to cut down on unnecessary contact then we reduce any chance of getting the virus and inadvertently passing it on."" The first minister also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present ""a real risk of transmission"" particularly if alcohol is involved. She said: ""Perhaps think about postponing your Christmas celebration until spring or summer next year, when hopefully we will see some greater normality return to our lives. ""I know all of this is very hard at the end of a horrible year, but these are not normal times and it's important we get through them as safely as possible."" There have been concerns about rising cases of the virus in some parts of the UK, withLondon facing a move to the highest tierof restrictions in England. However, the UK government has said it has ""no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which will allow greater mixing. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""all politicians are right to highlight the risks"" around the festive period. He said: ""This is not a risk-free option - this is an option to allow people to come together to celebrate Christmas, but to do so in a way that will be different to what we have experienced before. ""Let's do it safely - let's allow families as they can to come together in a small way, but know the risks of that and try to minimise the risks."" The Scottish Greens meanwhile said Ms Sturgeon's plea to cut contacts was contradictory to her stance on keeping all schools open. MSP Ross Greer said there was a ""very real chance that teachers could be spending their Christmas day calling pupils and their families to inform them they were a close contact of someone who tested positive and must self-isolate"", calling this a ""failure of leadership"" by the government.

First Scottish care home resident receives vaccine,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First care home resident receives vaccine A 90-year-old woman in South Lanarkshire has become the first care home resident to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Former carer Annie Innes was immunised at Abercorn House in Hamilton. Care home residents across Scotland have been prioritised to receive the vaccine, along with frontline health care staff. Ms Innes told reporters it was ""wonderful"" to get the vaccine just before Christmas. ""I hope it keeps me, my friends here and the staff safe and means we can get back to normal very soon,"" she said. She added: ""The nurses and the care home staff have been great with us and we are relieved to have been offered the vaccine."" Care home vaccinations to begin on Monday Covid vaccinations begin at sites across Scotland When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Health Secretary Jeane Freeman thanked those involved in rolling out the vaccine programme. ""It has been a challenge to get the Pfizer vaccine into care homes because of transport and storage requirements but I am delighted to see Mrs Innes become the first care home resident to receive her vaccine and I wish her many more years of good health,"" she said. ""Throughout the pandemic our priority has been to save lives and keep people safe. Vaccines give us a vital additional layer of protection we haven't had until now."" The second person vaccinated at the care home was 82-year-old Margaret Keating, a former bar tender who has been a resident at Abercorn House for a year. Residents and members of staff at Abercorn House will receive the vital second dose of the vaccine in the new year. Margaret Keating was the second care home resident in the country to be vaccinated Trudi Marshall, nurse director with health and social care North Lanarkshire, who is managing care home vaccination across the region, said they would be able to vaccinate 2,990 care home residents and 5,601 staff across 93 Lanarkshire care homes in the ""quick moving and complex operation"". ""It's important to recognise just how much work our staff have put in to the process in such a short time,"" she said. ""Care home staff and managers also deserve praise for their fantastic co-operation and help."" There were initial fears that care homes would not be able to receive the first batch of the drug because of logistical issues associated with its storage at -70C. More than 65,000 doses have been distributed to vaccination centres across Scotland where they have been ""packed down"" before being diluted for use in care homes. So far more than 5,000 frontline NHS staff and vaccinators have been given the first of two injections of the drug, which cuts cases of Covid by about 95%. The vaccination programme is beginning after themost recent official weekly figures showed,externalthere have been 78 deaths in care homes in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, said there were about 50,000 adults in care homes in Scotland and that prioritising those most in need was key. But he warned the vaccine rollout would be a slow process. Speaking toBBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme, he said: ""This is an tremendously important and positive day for residents, for their family members and also for staff. ""We've had nine months of sheer hell and distress across Scotland's care home sector. This virus has hit the most vulnerable the hardest, and those sadly are individuals in our care homes. ""So this really is the beginning of turning a corner."" Alison Strath, the Scottish government's interim chief pharmaceutical officer had worked ""tirelessly"" with the care home sector to ensure Scotland could be the first country where the vaccine could be taken to residents, he said. ""It is an amazing achievement in such a short space of time, but it will take a long time,"" Dr Macaskill said. He added: ""Practically, we need to work with the fact that we have a supply which is the first phase supply and we need to prioritise those most at risk."" Along with rapid testing, which has begun in some care homes and is also being rolled out across the country from Monday, the vaccines would allow visits to residents to begin to return to normal, he said.

New Uighur cotton evidence 'game-changer' for fashion brandsJesy leaves Little Mix to escape 'pressure'," By John Sudworth By John Sudworth Alongside a large network of detention camps, in which more than a million are thought to have been detained, allegations that minority groups are being coerced into working in textile factories have already been well documented. The Chinese government denies the claims, insisting that the camps are “vocational training schools” and the factories are part of a massive, and voluntary, “poverty alleviation” scheme. But the new evidence suggests that upwards of half a million minority workers a year are also being marshalled into seasonal cotton picking under conditions that again appear to raise a high risk of coercion. “In my view the implications are truly on a historical scale,” Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washingtonwho uncovered the documents, told the BBC. “For the first time we not only have evidence of Uighur forced labour in manufacturing, in garment making, it’s directly about the picking of cotton, and I think that is such a game-changer. “Anyone who cares about ethical sourcing has to look at Xinjiang, which is 85% of China’s cotton and 20% of the world’s cotton, and say, ‘We can’t do this anymore.’” The documents, a mixture of online government policy papers and state news reports, show that in 2018 the prefectures of Aksu and Hotan sent 210,000 workers “via labour transfer” to pick cotton for a Chinese paramilitary organisation, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Others speak of pickers being “mobilised and organised” and transported to fields hundreds of kilometres away. This year, Aksu identified a need for 142,700 workers for its own fields, which was largely met through the principle of “transferring all those who should be transferred.” References to “guiding” the pickers to “consciously resist illegal religious activities” indicate that the policies are designed predominantly for Xinjiang’s Uighurs and other traditionally Muslim groups. Government officials first sign “contracts of intent” with the cotton farms, determining the “number of workers hired, the location, the accommodation and wages,” after which pickers are then mobilised to “enthusiastically sign up”. There are plenty of clues that this enthusiasm is less than whole-hearted. One report describes a village where people were “unwilling to work in agriculture”. Officials had to visit again to perform “thought education work”. Eventually 20 were sent off, with a plan in place to “export” 60 more. China has long used the mass relocation of its rural poor - with the stated aim of improving their employment prospects - as part of a national anti-poverty campaign. In recent years, those efforts have gone into overdrive. Arguably President Xi Jinping’s most important domestic political priority, the goal is to eliminate absolute poverty in time for the Communist Party’s centenary next year. But in Xinjiang there is evidence of a far more political purpose and much higher levels of control, as well as massivetargets and quotaswhich officials are under pressure to meet. A marked shift in China’s approach to the region can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014, blamed by China on Uighur Islamists and separatists. Its response, from 2016 onwards, has been the building of“re-education”campsfor anyone displaying any behaviour viewed as a potential sign of untrustworthiness, such as installing an encrypted messaging app on a phone, viewing religious content or having a relative living overseas. While China calls them “schools for de-radicalisation”,its own recordssuggest that the reality is a draconian system of internment which aims to replace old identities of faith and culture with an enforced loyalty to the Communist Party. But the construction work didn’t stop with the camps. Since 2018, a huge industrial expansion has been under way involving the building of hundreds of factories. The parallel purpose of mass employment and mass internment is made clear by the appearance of many factories within the walls of the camps, or in close proximity to them. Work, the government appears to believe, will help transform the“outdated ideas”of Xinjiang’s minorities and remake them as modern, secular, wage-earning Chinese citizens. This facility built in 2017 in the city of Kuqa, has been identified as a re-education camp by researchers Open-source satellite images show internal security walls and what appears to be a guard tower. A new factory appeared next door in 2018. Shortly after construction finished, the satellite picked up something significant. Independent analysts confirm that masses of people, all apparently wearing the same colour uniforms, can be seen walking in close formation between the two sites. When the BBC tried to visit, a number of unmarked cars followed us as we filmed the perimeter of the complex. The factory and the camp now appear to have been amalgamated into one large factory complex, plastered with propaganda slogans extolling the benefits of the anti-poverty campaign. Before long we were stopped from filming and forced to leave. According to local state-run media, the textile factory employs up to 3000 people “under the mobilisation and organisation of the government”. But it’s impossible to verify who the people in the satellite image are or what the conditions for the workers in the facility are like today. Questions sent directly to the factory have gone unanswered. The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang The BBC was repeatedly stopped, questioned, prevented from filming and tailed by multiple unmarked cars for hundreds of kilometres across Xinjiang Despite the link between camps and factories, it is mostly those who haven’t been detained who are themain targetsof Xinjiang’s poverty alleviation campaign. Often from poor farming or herding families, more than two million of them have been mobilised for work, in many cases after first being put through short bouts of “military-style” job training. So far, the available evidence suggests that, like the camp inmates, they too have been used as a source of labour in factories and, in particular, Xinjiang’s booming textile mills. In July this year, the US based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)concludedthat it was “possible” that minorities were also being sent to pick cotton, but “more information is needed.” The new documents found by Dr Zenz not only provide that information, they also reveal a clear political purpose behind this mass transfer of minorities into the fields. An August 2016 notice issued by the Xinjiang regional government on the management of cotton pickers instructs officials to “strengthen their ideological education and ethnic unity education”. One propaganda report found by Dr Zenz suggests that the cotton fields present an opportunity to transform the “deep-rooted, lazy thinking” of poor, rural villagers by showing them that “labour is glorious”. Such phrases echo the Chinese state’s view of Uighurlifestyles and customsas acting as a barrier to modernisation. A desire to stay home and “bring up children” is described as an “important cause of poverty” by another propaganda report about the benefits of cotton picking. The state is providing “centralised” systems of care for children, the elderly and for livestock, so that everyone is “freed from the worries of going out to work.” And there are many references to how the mobilised cotton pickers are subject to controls and surveillance seemingly at odds with any normal employment practice. A policy document from Aksu, dated October this year, decrees that cotton pickers must be transported in groups and accompanied by officials who “eat, live, study and work with them, actively implementing thought education during cotton picking”. Mahmut, not his real name, is a young Uighur now living in Europe who cannot return to Xinjiang because a history of overseas travel is one of the main reasons for internment in a camp. Contact with his family back home is also now far too risky for them. But when they last spoke in 2018 he heard that both his mother and sister had been transferred to work. “They took my sister to Aksu City, to a textile factory,” he tells me. “She stayed in that factory for three months and didn’t get any money. “In winter, my mother was picking cotton for government officials - they say they need five or ten per cent of the village, they come to every family door by door. “People go because they’re afraid of being taken to jail or somewhere else.” Over the past five years, these door-to-door visits have become a key mechanism of control in Xinjiang, with 350,000 officials despatched to gather detailed, intrusive information on every single minority household. Those being called to work by these “village-based work teams” will be only too aware that they are also instrumental in deciding who should be sent to a camp. Xinjiang’s cotton growing industry used to rely on seasonal, migrant workers from other provinces in China. But cotton picking is notoriously hard work and rising wages and better jobs elsewhere mean the migrants have stopped coming. Now propaganda reports write glowingly of how the newly found supply of local labour has both solved this labour crisis and helped increase profits for the growers. But nowhere is there any real explanation of why hundreds of thousands of people, who apparently had no previous interest in picking cotton, should suddenly rush into the fields. Although the documents claim that pay levels can top 5000 RMB ($763, £570) a month, one report appears to suggest that for 132 pickers organised from one village, the average monthly salary was just 1,670 RMB ($255, £188)) each. Whatever the salary level, paid labour can still be considered forced labour under the relevantinternational convention. In response to questions submitted to China’s foreign ministry, the BBC received a faxed statement saying: “Workers from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang choose their jobs according to their own free will and sign voluntary employment contracts in accordance with the law.” Xinjiang’s poverty rate has fallen from almost 20% in 2014 to a little more than 1% today, it said. And it dismissed accusations of forced labour as “completely fabricated”, saying instead that China’s critics wanted to cause “forced unemployment and forced poverty” in Xinjiang. “The smiling faces of all of Xinjiang’s ethnic groups are the most powerful response to America’s lies and rumours,” it added. But the Better Cotton Initiative, an independent industry body that promotes ethical and sustainable standards, told the BBC that concerns over China’s poverty alleviation scheme were one of the main reasons they’ve recently decided to stop auditing and certifying farms in Xinjiang. Director of standards and assurance, Damien Sanfilippo, said: “We’ve identified the risk that poor, rural communities would be coerced into employment linked to this poverty alleviation programme. “Even if these workers get a decent wage – which is possible – they may not have chosen that employment freely.” Mr Sanfilippo, who also cited the increasingly restricted access to Xinjiang for his international monitors as another factor, said the organisation’s decision to walk away only further raises the risk for the global fashion industry. “To the best of my knowledge there isn’t any organisation that is active locally who can provide verification for that cotton.” The BBC approached 30 major international brands. Three – Marks and Spencer, Next, and Tesco – told us they have policies in place that ensure products sourced from China do not use raw cotton from Xinjiang. Burberry said they do not use any cotton from China at all. Others, including those who don't source direct from Xinjiang, were unable to guarantee its cotton didn't enter supply chains elsewhere. Nine companies gave no response. As we prepare to leave Xinjiang, just outside the city of Korla we pass a location that was, as recently as 2015, a patch of open desert. It is now home to a giant, prison camp complex, with what independent analysts say are multiple factory buildings visible inside.  We believe this is the first independent footage of the colossal site. It is just one of many such complexes that now dot the landscape, and a chilling final reminder of the blurred boundaries between mass incarceration and mass labour in Xinjiang.

Coronavirus outbreaks at fur farms in the US and in Europe have killed thousands of the animals. As a consequence, millions of farmed mink have had to be culled across Europe. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink. The USDA said it had found one positive case in ""free-ranging, wild mink"" in Utah as part of wildlife surveillance around infected farms. Several animals from different wildlife species were sampled and all tested negative, the agency added. It said it had notified the World Organisation for Animal Health, but there is no evidence the virus has been widespread in wild populations around infected mink farms. ""To our knowledge, this is the first free-ranging, native wild animal confirmed with Sars-CoV-2,"" the USDA said inan alert to the International Society for Infectious Diseases,external. The virus spreads rapidly in fur farms The discovery raises concerns that the infection could spread between wild mink, said Dr Dan Horton, a veterinary expert at the University of Surrey, UK. The case ""reinforces the need to undertake surveillance in wildlife and remain vigilant"", he added. Mink are known to escape from mink farms and become established in the wild. In the UK, there is a population that is thought to have arisen from animals that escaped from fur farms many years ago, Dr Horton added. The virus has also been found in zoo tigers, lions and snow leopards in the US, and in a small number of household cats and dogs. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Man jailed for Scotland-Isle of Man crossingDale McLaughlan travelled across the Irish Sea on a water scooter to see his girlfriend, a court hears.Isle Of Man / Ellan Vannin","McLaughlan arrived in Ramsey on Friday afternoon and then walked to Douglas A man who crossed the Irish Sea from Scotland to the Isle of Man ""on a jet ski"" to visit his girlfriend has been jailed for breaching Covid-19 laws. Douglas Courthouse heard 28-year-old Dale McLaughlan took four-and-a-half hours to travel from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on Friday. McLaughlan, from North Ayrshire, made the crossing despite having never driven a water scooter before. He admitted arriving unlawfully on the island and was jailed for four weeks. Under the island's current laws, only non-residents given special permission are allowed to enter the Isle of Man. McLaughlan, of Warrix Avenue in Irvine, was previously given permission to work as a roofer on the island for four weeks in September and, after isolating for 14 days, met his girlfriend on a night out. The court heard his subsequent applications to return had been rejected. Prosecutors said the 28-year-old bought the vehicle and set off on the journey of about 25 miles (40km), which he had expected to take 40 minutes. After he arrived in Ramsey at about 13:00 GMT, he walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas, who believed he had been on the island working for several weeks, the court was told. The following afternoon, he gave a police officer her address as his own and that evening, the couple went to two busy nightclubs. Following identification checks, police arrested him on Sunday evening. In mitigation, the 28-year-old's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner. Sentencing him, Deputy High Bailiff Christopher Arrowsmith said McLaughlan had made a ""deliberate and intentional attempt to circumnavigate"" the border restrictions, potentially putting the community at risk. He said the ""carefully planned"" journey had also put the 28-year-old ""at very real risk"" of harm. Speaking after the hearing, a government spokesman said following an investigation, public health officials were ""satisfied"" there was ""no wider risk to the public"".

Missing Briton was 'experienced hiker loving life'Esther Dingley's partner and family say she was content with life as they dismiss media speculation.Tyne & Wear,"Esther Dingley last spoke to her partner on 22 November A British hiker missing in the Pyrenees was an experienced walker who was happy with life, her family have said. The search for Esther Dingley, 37, began after she failed to return from a solo trek as planned on 25 November. She last communicated with her partner of 19 years Dan Colegate via Whatsapp on 22 November when she was atop Pic de Sauvegarde on the Spain-France border. Mr Colegate has dismissed media reports that she was unhappy, which seemingly stem from a French police source. Ms Dingley had been travelling alone in the couple's campervan for a month while he stayed at a French vineyard, the pair havinggiven up their home in Durham to tour Europe in 2014. Mr Colegate said: ""We spoke every day, the time apart worked as we expected, and we were very joyful when we spoke. ""The hike she went missing on was to be her last before driving back. Our last conversation was totally loving and all smiles. She was so happy, and we were excited to see each other. ""Why the police [officer] who spoke to a journalist implied 'things weren't as happy as they looked' baffles me. ""I have never spoken to the person quoted."" Esther Dingley and Dan Colegate had always been keen travellers Mr Colegate also said claims he had been ""quizzed"" multiple times by police were a misrepresentation of the numerous meetings he has had with both French and Spanish police to provide information. Ms Dingley's mother Ria described her daughter as an ""open book"" and said while the couple may have faced some ""difficult decisions"" about continuing their touring after Brexit, ""that didn't dampen her joy for the life they both were living"". She said: ""We are utterly distraught not knowing where Esther is or what has happened to her and would implore anyone who may know anything, however seemingly insignificant, to come forward."" Mr Colegate said it was normal for the couple to spend time apart but that they also enjoyed their trips together, which included a 1,000 mile hike in the summer. Esther Dingley and Dan Colegate have been touring Europe in a campervan with their five dogs He described Ms Dingley as a ""very experienced"" mountain hiker who always kept him updated with her planned routes. Mr Colegate said: ""The terrain she was on is not difficult. The weather was excellent. It does not mean she hasn't had an accident; I just consider it unlikely. ""There seems to be a perception that because it's the mountains, because it's nearly winter and because Esther was alone, that what she was doing was reckless."" Police have previously said they are looking at all options including ""non-accidental"" ones. Ms Dingley's family is now being supported by LBT Global, formerly the Lucie Blackman Trust, which assists relatives of missing people abroad. Chief executive Matthew Searle MBE called for a ""swift end"" to speculation about what has happened to Ms Dingley. He said: ""Our priority is supporting Esther's loved ones through this traumatic time and it is clear they are deeply upset at some of the speculation. ""Spreading unconfirmed assumptions is unhelpful and unfair, as well as deeply upsetting for those closest to Esther.""

"All Windrush victims to get at least Â£10,000People wrongly threatened with deportation previously received a minimum of Â£250.UK Politics","This video can not be played Priti Patel says she âalways promised to listen and actâ and that it was her mission to âcorrect the wrongs of the pastâ. The government is to give more money to victims of the Windrush scandal, which saw hundreds of people wrongly threatened with deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the minimum payment will rise from Â£250 to Â£10,000, and the maximum from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000. The figure will be higher still in ""exceptional"" circumstances, with money coming through quicker than before. The Windrush scandal mainly affected UK citizens originally from the Caribbean. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when ""hostile environment"" immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under then Home Secretary Theresa May. UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? The scandal broke in 2018, including the revelation that many of those affected had lost homes and jobs and had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The BBC's Westminster Hour reported last month that at least nine people had died while awaiting payments under the compensation scheme set up for victims. By Jack Fenwick, Westminster Hour Campaigners for the Windrush victims are likely to ask why this announcement by the home secretary didn't come sooner. The government acted quickly in setting up the Windrush Compensation Scheme when the scandal became public in 2018, but that scheme has long been criticised for being too slow and resulting in offers some say are too low. The speed at which claims are processed and money is offered is seen as being particularly crucial, given that many of those affected are elderly. The additional announcement that the compensation process for loss of earnings will also change could potentially lead to even larger payouts for victims. Early responses from claimants suggest a sense of cautious optimism at the latest announcement, with one person telling me they won't believe it until a cheque is in the post. The Windrush Compensation Scheme will be updated following consultation with the Windrush Working Group, chaired by Bishop Derek Webley. Ms Patel told the House of Commons there would be ""substantial changes"". She added that these would ""make a real difference to people's lives"", saying: ""I've always promised to listen and act to ensure that the victims of Windrush receive the maximum amount of compensation they deserve. ""It's my mission to correct the wrongs of the past and I will continue to work with the Windrush Working Group to do exactly that."" The changes to the scheme will apply retrospectively, meaning those previously given less than Â£10,000 will receive top-up payments. The Home Office is also removing the 12 months' salary limit on compensation for earnings lost by people forced out of their jobs. It will start letting those affected by the changes know from next week. Bishop Webley said: ""Many will benefit from the relief that these new payments will provide, and begin to move forward with their lives with hope and determination."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report last month said government action taken to ""record and respond to negative equality impacts"" of hostile environment immigration policies had been ""perfunctory, and therefore insufficient"". It called for a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"", with the commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, describing the treatment of the Windrush generation as ""a shameful stain on British history"". The Windrush compensation scheme came into force last year, with Â£2m being paid out so far and a further Â£1m offered.

'He made a lot of Liverpool fans smile again',"Gerard Houllier put a smile on the faces of a lot of people who support Liverpool, say fans Liverpool fans have paid tribute to the team's former manager Gerard Houllier remembering the Frenchman as ""a gentleman"" who ""returned pride"" to the club. Houllier, who led Liverpool to five major trophies, died earlier on Monday, aged 73. He ""brought the good times back"", said Reds supporter John Gibbons. One fans' group is already looking to arrange a memorial tribute to Houllier at Anfield. Andy Knott, who twice previously arranged crowd mosaics in Houllier's honour, said he ""most definitely"" would look to remember him in a special way once supporters are allowed to return in numbers. After Houllier's heart attack in 2001, the Kop paid tribute in French spelling out the word 'Allez' Liverpool fans first showed their appreciation for their then manager in November 2001, spelling out his initials 'GH' after he underwent open heart surgery at Broadgreen Hospital, having been taken ill a month earlier. On the Frenchman's return to management duties in March 2002, supporters once again united to spell out the words ""Allez, allez"" to mark his recovery. Mr Knott, who is a contributor to Liverpool fanzine, Red All Over The Land, met Houllier at the club's Melwood training base soon after, and remembers him as ""a likeable gentleman"". ""He was busy, but came down and had a good chat with us and said how he was so grateful,"" he said. Gerard Houllier guided Liverpool to a treble in the 2000-01 season, which included winning the UEFA Cup Houllier is a figure that will forever remain ""very much loved"" in Liverpool for the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup treble-winning season of 2000-2001. Lifelong Reds fan Damian Kavanagh was there for all three finals. ""What a time of our lives that was,"" he said. ""That is how he should be remembered. no-one is perfect, he didn't get every single decision right, but he really did bring Liverpool up to date when we needed it because we were struggling before he took charge. Ex-Liverpool boss Houllier dies aged 73 'A fine, decent man, destined to manage Liverpool' Tributes and reaction to Houllier's death Kavanagh said Houllier's history in the city, having worked as a teacher in the Liverpool in the 1960s when he also watched the team as a fan at Anfield, ensured a ""strong connection"". ""The fact he had been on the Kop and lived amongst us all here showed that he understood how much the team means to us,"" Kavanagh continued. ""In our short lives all you can ever leave behind is smiles and Houllier can certainly rest peacefully that there are a hell of a lot of people that support Liverpool that he made smile."" John Gibbons (third from left) with fellow Liverpool supporters meeting Gerard Houllier at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil For John Gibbons, a podcaster for the Anfield Wrap, Houllier is manager that delivered glory to a new generation. ""We loved it (treble season) because for us winning trophies is what Liverpool did on video, on VHS tapes,"" he said.

Man jailed for Scotland-Isle of Man crossing,"McLaughlan arrived in Ramsey on Friday afternoon and then walked to Douglas A man who crossed the Irish Sea from Scotland to the Isle of Man ""on a jet ski"" to visit his girlfriend has been jailed for breaching Covid-19 laws. Douglas Courthouse heard 28-year-old Dale McLaughlan took four-and-a-half hours to travel from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on Friday. McLaughlan, from North Ayrshire, made the crossing despite having never driven a water scooter before. He admitted arriving unlawfully on the island and was jailed for four weeks. Under the island's current laws, only non-residents given special permission are allowed to enter the Isle of Man. McLaughlan, of Warrix Avenue in Irvine, was previously given permission to work as a roofer on the island for four weeks in September and, after isolating for 14 days, met his girlfriend on a night out. The court heard his subsequent applications to return had been rejected. Prosecutors said the 28-year-old bought the vehicle and set off on the journey of about 25 miles (40km), which he had expected to take 40 minutes. After he arrived in Ramsey at about 13:00 GMT, he walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas, who believed he had been on the island working for several weeks, the court was told. The following afternoon, he gave a police officer her address as his own and that evening, the couple went to two busy nightclubs. Following identification checks, police arrested him on Sunday evening. In mitigation, the 28-year-old's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner. Sentencing him, Deputy High Bailiff Christopher Arrowsmith said McLaughlan had made a ""deliberate and intentional attempt to circumnavigate"" the border restrictions, potentially putting the community at risk. He said the ""carefully planned"" journey had also put the 28-year-old ""at very real risk"" of harm. Speaking after the hearing, a government spokesman said following an investigation, public health officials were ""satisfied"" there was ""no wider risk to the public"".

Attack victim used silent code on 999 call,"Alexander Boy admitted battery at Exeter Crown Court A woman who called 999 while being attacked by her boyfriend used a silent code to tell police she needed help but was unable to speak, a court heard. Emma Parkinson raised the alarm when she was kicked in the face by Alexander Boy at her home in Exeter. Boy, 25, of Station Road, Keswick, admitted battery and was jailed for 16 months at Exeter Crown Court. Miss Parkinson pressed 55 during the 999 call. This told the operator she was too scared or unable to speak. The system, called theSilent Solutionhelps call handlers distinguish between nuisance and genuine calls. The attack happened on 13 September after Boy had been drinking, the court heard. He woke Miss Parkinson up at 04:00 GMT by sitting at the end of her bed and playing loud music on his phone. When she kicked him off the bed, he pulled her to the ground before kicking her in the face. Boy was arrested as he fled Miss Parkinson's flat and officers found her injured in her bedroom. Miss Parkinson was left with bruising all over her face and head, the court was told. Alexander Boy was jailed for 16 months at Exeter Crown Court At the time of the attack, Boy was serving a suspended sentence for two previous attacks on Miss Parkinson. Judge Timothy Rose told Boy: ""You have a very worrying inability to control yourself in matters of domestic violence. ""This assault occurred when you were under the influence of alcohol, which makes it worse rather than better."" He imposed a seven-year restraining order banning any further contact with Miss Parkinson. In a victim impact statement, Miss Parkinson said she was being treated for depression and felt embarrassed for ignoring advice from friends who warned her against resuming the relationship.

First case of coronavirus detected in wild mink,"Farmed mink are known to escape into the wild The first known case of coronavirus in a wild animal has been reported, leading to calls for widespread monitoring of wildlife. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said a wild mink had tested positive around an infected mink farm in Utah. Coronavirus outbreaks at fur farms in the US and in Europe have killed thousands of the animals. As a consequence, millions of farmed mink have had to be culled across Europe. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink. The USDA said it had found one positive case in ""free-ranging, wild mink"" in Utah as part of wildlife surveillance around infected farms. Several animals from different wildlife species were sampled and all tested negative, the agency added. It said it had notified the World Organisation for Animal Health, but there is no evidence the virus has been widespread in wild populations around infected mink farms. ""To our knowledge, this is the first free-ranging, native wild animal confirmed with Sars-CoV-2,"" the USDA said inan alert to the International Society for Infectious Diseases,external. The virus spreads rapidly in fur farms The discovery raises concerns that the infection could spread between wild mink, said Dr Dan Horton, a veterinary expert at the University of Surrey, UK. The case ""reinforces the need to undertake surveillance in wildlife and remain vigilant"", he added. Mink are known to escape from mink farms and become established in the wild. In the UK, there is a population that is thought to have arisen from animals that escaped from fur farms many years ago, Dr Horton added. The virus has also been found in zoo tigers, lions and snow leopards in the US, and in a small number of household cats and dogs. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Cyberpunk 2077 makers apologise for game glitches,"The makers of one of most anticipated games of the year have apologised and offered refunds amid a backlash from gamers about performance problems. Cyberpunk 2077, which stars Keanu Reeves, came out last week after several delays. Problems with glitches and crashing have mostly appeared on last generation consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. CD Projekt Red says it ""should have paid more attention to making it play better"" on those consoles. They are now offering refunds to people who want to return the game. Allow Twitter content?

Problems reported include choppy frame rates and screen tearing, but those with the newest versions of consoles have not experienced them. Reviewers were sent a PC version of the game, which appears to be one of the reasons the problems were not reported before the game was released. The game was originallysupposed to be released in April, but faced three delays before its eventual release. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Gamers have been let down' Analysis by Steffan Powell, Newsbeat's gaming reporter One of the games that has had people salivating at every preview snippet or video for years - Cyperpunk 2077 was expected by some to be one of the best games ever made. While many reviewers still hold it in very high regard, especially when running on a PC, the problems that have made the game almost unplayable on many consoles will be a source of embarrassment for the developers. CD Projekt Red, up until now, has been considered one of the most respected game creators in the industry. This will no doubt be upsetting and frustrating for the team that worked so hard on trying to get the game ready in time for Christmas. Also upset and frustrated though are the gamers who feel let down by the developer's failure to be fully transparent about the performance of the game they were buying on consoles. It's hard to tell at the moment just how damaging to the reputation of the company this incident will be. It's not uncommon for games to be released with bugs and errors in them - and 2020 has been a year like no other, making game development even harder than it is normally. But for the conversation around a major title to be totally dominated by issues like this is rare and has overshadowed the release. It begs the question - why didn't the company delay release one more time until these issues were sorted? The developers have said they will be releasing a number of patches in January and February to fix the game for players who want to hang on to their copies of the game. Digital versions can be refunded through Sony and Microsoft online stores, while the boxed version can be returned to stores.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Attack victim used silent code on 999 callThe code indicates to police that someone is in distress but unable to speak.Devon,"Alexander Boy admitted battery at Exeter Crown Court A woman who called 999 while being attacked by her boyfriend used a silent code to tell police she needed help but was unable to speak, a court heard. Emma Parkinson raised the alarm when she was kicked in the face by Alexander Boy at her home in Exeter. Boy, 25, of Station Road, Keswick, admitted battery and was jailed for 16 months at Exeter Crown Court. Miss Parkinson pressed 55 during the 999 call. This told the operator she was too scared or unable to speak. The system, called theSilent Solutionhelps call handlers distinguish between nuisance and genuine calls. The attack happened on 13 September after Boy had been drinking, the court heard. He woke Miss Parkinson up at 04:00 GMT by sitting at the end of her bed and playing loud music on his phone. When she kicked him off the bed, he pulled her to the ground before kicking her in the face. Boy was arrested as he fled Miss Parkinson's flat and officers found her injured in her bedroom. Miss Parkinson was left with bruising all over her face and head, the court was told. Alexander Boy was jailed for 16 months at Exeter Crown Court At the time of the attack, Boy was serving a suspended sentence for two previous attacks on Miss Parkinson. Judge Timothy Rose told Boy: ""You have a very worrying inability to control yourself in matters of domestic violence. ""This assault occurred when you were under the influence of alcohol, which makes it worse rather than better."" He imposed a seven-year restraining order banning any further contact with Miss Parkinson. In a victim impact statement, Miss Parkinson said she was being treated for depression and felt embarrassed for ignoring advice from friends who warned her against resuming the relationship.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Man who 'begged' for MRI scan dies from cancerSherwin Hall made 13 hospital visits before he was given an MRI scan which revealed several tumours.Leeds & West Yorkshire,"LaTroya Hall (left) said she had been ""devastated"" by the death of her husband Sherwin A man who had to ""beg"" to get an MRI scan because of the Covid-19 crisis has died of cancer, his family have said. Sherwin Hall, 27, from Leeds, first went to hospital on 23 March suffering leg pain but was misdiagnosed and sent away with a course of antibiotics. After 13 visits in four weeks a scan on 26 May revealed a tumour in his pelvis and 30 small tumours on his lungs. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it had maintained scanning for all ""urgent interventions"". Mr Hall's wife LaTroya said had his cancer been found sooner ""it is likely he would still be here today"". Before his death, Mr Hall said he ""kept begging"" for a scan but was told services had been ""slowed down because of the coronavirus"". In July, he featured in a special BBC Panorama programmeBritain's Cancer Crisis. More news from across Yorkshire Sherwin Hall made 13 hospital visits before he was given an MRI scan Mrs Hall, who is being supported by the Catch Up With Cancer Campaign, said she was ""devastated"" and had ""lost the love of my life"". The campaign was launched by the parents ofMacclesfield beautician Kelly Smith who died after her treatment for bowel cancer was stopped as a result of the pandemic. Mrs Hall said: ""It worries me that the government and NHS leaders continue to say cancer services are back to normal; our family's experience has been that, even now, this is simply not the case. ""Even if services were back at pre-pandemic levels, that is not enough. The cancer backlog also needs to be cleared."" Cancer charity Macmillan Cancer Support estimated there was a backlog of 50,000 people living with undiagnosed cancer across the UK as a result of the pandemic. A spokeswoman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr Hall's family at this very difficult time."" She said the trust had maintained scanning for all ""urgent interventions"" throughout the pandemic and had operated in accordance with Nice guidelines. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said cancer diagnosis and treatment had ""remained a priority"" during the pandemic and said the government had given Â£3bn to tackle the impact of Covid.

"Man jailed for Scotland-Isle of Man crossingDale McLaughlan travelled across the Irish Sea on a water scooter to see his girlfriend, a court hears.","McLaughlan arrived in Ramsey on Friday afternoon and then walked to Douglas A man who crossed the Irish Sea from Scotland to the Isle of Man ""on a jet ski"" to visit his girlfriend has been jailed for breaching Covid-19 laws. Douglas Courthouse heard 28-year-old Dale McLaughlan took four-and-a-half hours to travel from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on Friday. McLaughlan, from North Ayrshire, made the crossing despite having never driven a water scooter before. He admitted arriving unlawfully on the island and was jailed for four weeks. Under the island's current laws, only non-residents given special permission are allowed to enter the Isle of Man. McLaughlan, of Warrix Avenue in Irvine, was previously given permission to work as a roofer on the island for four weeks in September and, after isolating for 14 days, met his girlfriend on a night out. The court heard his subsequent applications to return had been rejected. Prosecutors said the 28-year-old bought the vehicle and set off on the journey of about 25 miles (40km), which he had expected to take 40 minutes. After he arrived in Ramsey at about 13:00 GMT, he walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas, who believed he had been on the island working for several weeks, the court was told. The following afternoon, he gave a police officer her address as his own and that evening, the couple went to two busy nightclubs. Following identification checks, police arrested him on Sunday evening. In mitigation, the 28-year-old's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner. Sentencing him, Deputy High Bailiff Christopher Arrowsmith said McLaughlan had made a ""deliberate and intentional attempt to circumnavigate"" the border restrictions, potentially putting the community at risk. He said the ""carefully planned"" journey had also put the 28-year-old ""at very real risk"" of harm. Speaking after the hearing, a government spokesman said following an investigation, public health officials were ""satisfied"" there was ""no wider risk to the public"".

London theatres 'devastated',"Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December in the West End London theatres have been given the ""devastating news"" that they must shut again as the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions. A number of West End shows had restarted over the last two weeks. The Society of London Theatre said the move would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he knew it would have a ""huge impact"" but that the government ""must act quickly"". The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Pantoland at the London Palladium on Friday Socially distanced performances to smaller audiences had been allowed in London since the last national lockdown ended. Shows that had opened included Six the Musical, Love Letters, Everybody's Talking About Jamie and a concert version of Les Miserables starring Michael Ball and Alfie Boe. ""It was nice while it lasted,""tweeted Carrie Hope Fletcher,external, who was also part of the Les Miserables cast at the Sondheim Theatre. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, whose shows include Les Miserables, said the government's ""sudden volt[e] face"" was ""devastating for both the theatre and the economy"". ""The constant changes of rules and advice we have received is impossible for any business to react to,"" he continued. ""Where is the leadership this government promised?"" He now had ""no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen"", he added. Alfie Boe plays Jean Valjean in the Cameron Mackintosh production Andrew Lloyd Webber, who owns the London Palladium, said it seemed ""arbitrary and unfair"" that theatre performances were being banned while shopping could continue. But he said he ""reluctantly"" agrees with the decision to put London into tier three. Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary, Elaine Paige, Ashley Banjo and Nigel Havers, was among the other shows to have opened. On Friday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took their three children to a special performance of the production. Producer Michael Harrisonannounced on Twitter,externalthat its ""final"" two performances would take place on Tuesday and criticised the government's ""yo-young approach on advice"". He said: ""It is not possible for any business to function in an environment where our leaders seem to have no idea how our country will look from one week to the next."" The National Theatre will also have to close Dick Whittington, only the second pantomime it has ever staged. London to enter tier 3 Covid rules from Wednesday Cambridges make red carpet debut as family of five Prince 'praying' that live venues can reopen Actress Elaine Paige said she was disappointed that the theatre has to close, asking in a tweet why it was theatres were closing when Tube journeys and flights were still allowed. ""These rules are illogical,"" she said. ""The audience response shows how desperate they are for 2hrs of escapism. If its so terrible - cancel Christmas!"" The Society of London Theatre's chief executive Julian Bird said the announcement was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"". ""The past few days have seen venues beginning to reopen with high levels of Covid security, welcoming back enthusiastic, socially distanced audiences,"" he said. ""Theatres across London will now be forced to postpone or cancel planned performances, causing catastrophic financial difficulties for venues, producers and thousands of industry workers."" Death Drop at the Garrick Theatre is another show affected He urged the government to ""recognise the huge strain this has placed on the sector and look at rapid compensation to protect theatres and their staff over Christmas in all areas of the country"" that are in tier three. Mr Dowden said the rules had been tightened because the capital's rising coronavirus figures were ""deeply concerning"". The remaining Â£400m from the government's Culture Recovery Fund would ""be there to help those affected by [the] changes"", he promised. Allow Twitter content?

Jon Morgan, director of the Theatres Trust, called London's move into tier three ""a disaster"" for the sector. ""Theatres have worked incredibly hard to create safe environments for audiences and through no fault of their own will now face enormous financial losses,"" he said. He called for a government-backed insurance scheme for theatres, a request that was echoed by Sonia Friedman, producer of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and other shows. She said: ""London going into tier three is yet another blow for British theatre - one it simply cannot afford after a brutal year, and one that both could and should have been avoided. ""This feels like a final straw,"" she said of the latest measures, calling them ""proof that this government does not understand theatre and the existential crisis it is facing"". This video can not be played Behind the scenes at the Arts Theatre in London to meet the sassy women in King Henry VIII's life The producers of Six the Musical said it was ""frustrating that our industry has been sidelined once again and an already hard hit sector will have to try and survive with no income for a further period of uncertainty"". Andy Barnes and Kenny Wax said they and their fellow producers were ""being penalised for reopening the sector and rejuvenating the West End"". The move into tier three will also see cinemas and other entertainment venues forced to close their doors. The measures will have an impact on the UK release of Wonder Woman 1984, which is due to hit cinemas on Wednesday. A government spokesperson pointed to its Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund and said it remains ""completely committed"" to supporting the arts industry during the pandemic. They added: ""We held back Â£400m of contingency funding so we could respond to the changing public health context and will now use it to support organisations facing financial distress as a result of closure, as well as helping them transition back to fuller opening in the spring.""

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"London to enter tier 3 Covid rules from WednesdayParts of Essex and Hertfordshire will also face the toughest restrictions, the health secretary says.","This video can not be played Matt Hancock confirms that Greater London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire are being moved into Tier 3 restrictions. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into Englandâs highest tier of Covid restrictions, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The areas join tier three at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday, meaning some 34 million people will face the toughest rules. Anew variant of coronavirushas been identified that ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in southern England, Mr Hancock added. Pubs and restaurants in tier three must close except for takeaway and delivery. Also under the rules, sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums, and indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must remain shut. London theatres 'devastated' to close again Capital could become 'ghost town' under tier 3 What are the rules if my area moves to tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The health secretary told a Downing Street briefing that action had to be taken immediately - before the next scheduled review of England's three-tier system on Wednesday - to slow ""sharp, exponential rises"" in infection, adding that in some areas the virus was doubling around every seven days. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, Mr Hancock warned that hospitals across the capital and in Essex and Kent were already ""under pressure"". He described the rise in transmission and the new variant as ""a salutary warning for the whole country"". ""This isn't over yet,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains what you can do under tier 3 restrictions in England With Kent, Medway and Slough already under tier three rules, it means large parts of south-east England will soon join much of the Midlands, north-west England and north-east England under the strictest curbs on social contacts. More than 34 million people in England will be in tier three when the changes come into effect: 21.5 million in tier two; and about 700,000 in tier one. The latest tier three areas include: Greater London The south and west of Essex (Basildon, Brentwood, Harlow, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Rochford, Maldon, Braintree and Chelmsford, along with Thurrock and Southend-On-Sea borough councils) The south of Hertfordshire (Broxbourne, Hertsmere, Watford and the Three Rivers local authority) The move comes as another 20,263 cases have been recorded and a further 232 people have died in the UK, the government said on Monday. You cannot mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except with your household or bubble You can meet in a group of up to six in other outdoor spaces, such as parks, beaches or countryside Shops, gyms and personal care services (such as hairdressing) can stay open Bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway Sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums Indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must stay closed People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas Read more about the tier three rules Scientists are keeping a close watch on this variant as there are mutations to the ""spike protein"". This is the crucial part of the coronavirus that acts like the key to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. One mutation is on the crucial part of the spike that makes first contact with the outside of our cells. Another looks the same as one that emerged separately in mink, but seemed to make it harder for antibodies from Covid survivors to attack the virus. The three leading vaccines train the body to attack the spike, which is why people are asking if the variant will make the vaccines less effective. But vaccines teach the immune system to attack many parts of the spike so the view from health officials is these mutations are unlikely to affect the vaccine's effectiveness. And my golden rule for judging all ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" stories remains: Has the virus' behaviour actually changed? Viruses mutate all the time and they can become more common by just being in the right place at the right time. We still have no evidence the virus spreads more easily, is more dangerous or would affect the vaccine. Prof Whitty warned cases in some areas could rise ""very rapidly"" by Christmas - without action to combat the current doubling rate. But he stressed it was ""possible to turn this around with the tools we have"", highlighting how areas such as Liverpool have successfully brought infection rates down. Prof Fenton said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for London and parts of south-east England, which was why the government had had to take ""quick and decisive action"". Asked whether the government should rethink plans to ease some restrictions for Christmas, Mr Hancock said it was important ""everyone is cautious"" ahead of the festive period, especially when meeting vulnerable people. ""But we do understand why people do want to get together with their families,"" he said. At Christmas, people will be allowed to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends, butother tier rules will still apply. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs there was currently nothing to suggest that the new virus variant was more likely to cause serious disease. His advice was that it was ""highly unlikely"" the mutation would fail to respond to a vaccine. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warned the country was ""heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom"". And while London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the announcement as ""incredibly disappointing"" for businesses, he said it was clear the virus was accelerating ""in the wrong direction"" and urged all Londoners to follow the new rules. Essex County Council leader David Finch said local leaders would lobby the government for support ""during this very challenging time"", and Hertfordshire County Council's leader, David Williams, called for residents to ""stay disciplined and stick to the guidance"". Where are schools closing early for Christmas? How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? There was anger from London's hospitality and entertainment sectors, who will be hit hard by the fresh restrictions. Andy Jones, who owns Jones & Sons restaurant in Dalston, east London, said it was ""unacceptable to give the hospitality industry 24 hours' notice"". ""This week we had about Â£42,000 worth of bookings in the system already,"" he said, adding that the restaurant would be closed for business - apart from delivering takeaway meals on Sundays. ""My biggest gripe is that busy restaurants plan a week ahead. We've got a week's worth of food pretty much, either prepped ready to go, bought in already, which you can't send back, or on order."" Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh - currently putting on the Les MisÃ©rables musical in the West End - described the rules as ""devastating"". He said it made theatres' efforts to ensure safe performances  ""seem worthless"". Kate Nicholls, of trade body UKHospitality, said the move placed an ""unfair, illogical and disproportionate burden on hospitality businesses without effectively tackling Covid"". And Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said the move into tier three was ""another nail in the coffin for London's pubs, as well as those affected in parts of Hertfordshire and Essex. There was also disappointment thatsporting events in Londonwould no longer be able to welcome fans from Wednesday. Despite coronavirus cases continuing to rise, No 10 said the government ""has no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which effectively suspend the tier system of restrictions and allow more households to mix. In Scotland, people have been toldto ""cut down"" the number of contacts in the week before Christmasif they plan to meet up with relatives. In Wales, a second health boardhas suspended non-urgent care amid a continued rise in cases. And a leading doctor in Northern Irelandsaid its health service is facing a ""nightmare"" scenarioin January.

"Scots told to 'cut down contacts' before ChristmasNicola Sturgeon says Scots planning to meet up at Christmas should cut down on ""unnecessary contacts"" now.ScotlandComments","Scots have been urged to ""cut down on unnecessary contacts"" now if they plan to meet up with relatives at Christmas. Rules on household meetings are being eased for five days over the festive period, allowing up to eight people from three households to meet indoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those who choose to do this should cut contacts now to be as safe as possible. She said the ""best Christmas gift we can give family and friends"" is to ""keep our distance and keep them safe"". Ms Sturgeon also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present a ""real risk of transmission"". First care home resident receives vaccine Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Peoplewill be allowed to form Christmas ""bubbles""of three households between 23 and 27 December. Ms Sturgeon said this was a ""pragmatic step"" to make the festive period ""as safe as possible"" for those who feel they must meet up - but has repeatedly urged people not to do it unless absolutely necessary. At her coronavirus briefing on Monday, the first minister said Christmas might be ""the toughest"" point of the pandemic for many, but she added that people In Scotland should ""think really carefully"" about gathering indoors. She said: ""Hopefully next year this will all be a bad memory and we'll be looking forward to a much more normal Christmas. ""What we should be thinking about this Christmas is about ensuring that everyone we love is still there when we get to next Christmas, and that we're not losing more people to Covid along the way."" Ms Sturgeon said people planning to meet up should ""reduce unnecessary contacts between now and then"", particularly if they will be seeing elderly relatives. She suggested people avoid catching up with friends in cafes or car-sharing in the run-up to Christmas. The first minister said: ""By taking precautions to cut down on unnecessary contact then we reduce any chance of getting the virus and inadvertently passing it on."" The first minister also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present ""a real risk of transmission"" particularly if alcohol is involved. She said: ""Perhaps think about postponing your Christmas celebration until spring or summer next year, when hopefully we will see some greater normality return to our lives. ""I know all of this is very hard at the end of a horrible year, but these are not normal times and it's important we get through them as safely as possible."" There have been concerns about rising cases of the virus in some parts of the UK, withLondon facing a move to the highest tierof restrictions in England. However, the UK government has said it has ""no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which will allow greater mixing. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""all politicians are right to highlight the risks"" around the festive period. He said: ""This is not a risk-free option - this is an option to allow people to come together to celebrate Christmas, but to do so in a way that will be different to what we have experienced before. ""Let's do it safely - let's allow families as they can to come together in a small way, but know the risks of that and try to minimise the risks."" The Scottish Greens meanwhile said Ms Sturgeon's plea to cut contacts was contradictory to her stance on keeping all schools open. MSP Ross Greer said there was a ""very real chance that teachers could be spending their Christmas day calling pupils and their families to inform them they were a close contact of someone who tested positive and must self-isolate"", calling this a ""failure of leadership"" by the government.

Google services knocked offline in rare outage,"YouTube is just one of the services knocked offline Google applications including YouTube, email and Docs have suffered a rare service outage, with users unable to access many of the company's services. The outage started shortly before noon UK time, lasting more than half an hour before services were restored. Users around the world reported problems with Gmail, Google Drive, the Android Play Store, Maps and more. Google's search engine, however, remained unaffected by the problems affecting its other services. Google said the problem hit its authentication system, which is used for logging in and similar functions, and lasted about 45 minutes. Users were still able to access the websites' landing pages in ""incognito mode"", which does not store a log of the users' browsing activity. Allow Twitter content?

London to enter tier 3 Covid rules from Wednesday,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock confirms that Greater London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire are being moved into Tier 3 restrictions. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into Englandâs highest tier of Covid restrictions, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The areas join tier three at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday, meaning some 34 million people will face the toughest rules. Anew variant of coronavirushas been identified that ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in southern England, Mr Hancock added. Pubs and restaurants in tier three must close except for takeaway and delivery. Also under the rules, sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums, and indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must remain shut. London theatres 'devastated' to close again Capital could become 'ghost town' under tier 3 What are the rules if my area moves to tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The health secretary told a Downing Street briefing that action had to be taken immediately - before the next scheduled review of England's three-tier system on Wednesday - to slow ""sharp, exponential rises"" in infection, adding that in some areas the virus was doubling around every seven days. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, Mr Hancock warned that hospitals across the capital and in Essex and Kent were already ""under pressure"". He described the rise in transmission and the new variant as ""a salutary warning for the whole country"". ""This isn't over yet,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains what you can do under tier 3 restrictions in England With Kent, Medway and Slough already under tier three rules, it means large parts of south-east England will soon join much of the Midlands, north-west England and north-east England under the strictest curbs on social contacts. More than 34 million people in England will be in tier three when the changes come into effect: 21.5 million in tier two; and about 700,000 in tier one. The latest tier three areas include: Greater London The south and west of Essex (Basildon, Brentwood, Harlow, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Rochford, Maldon, Braintree and Chelmsford, along with Thurrock and Southend-On-Sea borough councils) The south of Hertfordshire (Broxbourne, Hertsmere, Watford and the Three Rivers local authority) The move comes as another 20,263 cases have been recorded and a further 232 people have died in the UK, the government said on Monday. You cannot mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except with your household or bubble You can meet in a group of up to six in other outdoor spaces, such as parks, beaches or countryside Shops, gyms and personal care services (such as hairdressing) can stay open Bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway Sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums Indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must stay closed People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas Read more about the tier three rules Scientists are keeping a close watch on this variant as there are mutations to the ""spike protein"". This is the crucial part of the coronavirus that acts like the key to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. One mutation is on the crucial part of the spike that makes first contact with the outside of our cells. Another looks the same as one that emerged separately in mink, but seemed to make it harder for antibodies from Covid survivors to attack the virus. The three leading vaccines train the body to attack the spike, which is why people are asking if the variant will make the vaccines less effective. But vaccines teach the immune system to attack many parts of the spike so the view from health officials is these mutations are unlikely to affect the vaccine's effectiveness. And my golden rule for judging all ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" stories remains: Has the virus' behaviour actually changed? Viruses mutate all the time and they can become more common by just being in the right place at the right time. We still have no evidence the virus spreads more easily, is more dangerous or would affect the vaccine. Prof Whitty warned cases in some areas could rise ""very rapidly"" by Christmas - without action to combat the current doubling rate. But he stressed it was ""possible to turn this around with the tools we have"", highlighting how areas such as Liverpool have successfully brought infection rates down. Prof Fenton said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for London and parts of south-east England, which was why the government had had to take ""quick and decisive action"". Asked whether the government should rethink plans to ease some restrictions for Christmas, Mr Hancock said it was important ""everyone is cautious"" ahead of the festive period, especially when meeting vulnerable people. ""But we do understand why people do want to get together with their families,"" he said. At Christmas, people will be allowed to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends, butother tier rules will still apply.

Intensive care staff beg for pre-Christmas lockdown,"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"". But Mr Gething fears people would ""make up their own rules"" if meeting up over Christmas was banned. Wales has thehighest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK- a seven-day average of 425 cases per 100,000 - and eight of the UK's top 10 worst infected areas are in Wales with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend the top three. In a letter to the health minister, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman Dr Richard Pugh warns critical care services will not be able to cope over the winter period without intervention ""at the highest level"". Christmas five-day relaxation period 'a mistake' How do Wales Covid cases compare to other nations? Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients Up to three households can stay together and form a""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, all four UK nations have agreed. But the body representing intensive care staff want that decision reviewed amid fears it will cause a surge in cases. ""Christmas is a special time but it seems a very, very difficult thing to justify,"" said Dr Pugh. ""It makes no sense viewed from a perspective of front-line staff and public health."" With 190 critical care beds already being used - almost half by coronavirus patients - Dr Pugh said critical care was already over-capacity. ""Welsh critical care services will be unable to manage rising demands relating to Covid-19, to maintain emergency non-Covid activity, and to continue providing peri-operative care for high risk urgent surgical cases in coming weeks without intervention at the highest level,"" he said. Two health boards in south Wales have already cancelled some non-urgent care - Swansea Bay andAneurin Bevan University Health Boards. This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Ambulances waited for the equivalent of a week to deliver sick patients to hospital staff at the new Â£350m Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran on Saturday. On Sunday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board apologised after a73-year-old man waited more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside that hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service said more than 10 patients had waited more than 12 hours in ambulances outside hospitals awaiting beds in the last week. The family of Ted Edwards from Monmouthshire said he waited for 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital The service has raised its alert system to its highest level, which signals ""extreme pressure"". ""We've seen more Covid-related patients in the last six weeks than than we've seen since March,"" chief executive Jason Killenstold BBC Radio Wales. ""We've more staff off sick or self-isolating since April and we've seen some of our busiest days this year in the last 10 days, with four of the last five days the busiest since the start of the pandemic."" Added to ""congestion"" outside hospital A&E departments, Mr Killen apologised as ambulance crews had ""real difficulties being able to respond in a timely way, particularly to less serious patients"". Dr Pugh said there was now a case for the cancellation of elective surgery to happen on a ""national basis"" to allow the NHS to be able to treat new patients as coronavirus cases increased. He said that while imposing more stringent rules ahead of the festive period was difficult, the impact of lockdowns took weeks to help departments. ""Viewed from a front-line perspective, I am afraid we do not have the luxury of deferring such steps until after the Christmas period,"" added the intensive care consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire. Morriston Hospital will be one of those in Swansea only treating urgent cases Mr Gething said the situation across Wales was ""very serious"" but added it was not Wales' ""preference"" to break the Christmas rule relaxation. ""There is a lot of capital invested in that easing of the rules which all four countries signed up to,"" he said. Mr Gething said officials were now working with hospitals to look at how to send patients who were no longer infectious - especially the elderly - home. The seven-day case rate for Swansea Bay Health Board area, which treats patients in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea, now stands at 770.3 per 100,000 people. It has the second highest rate for any of the board areas in Wales, behind Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board on 870.3. There were also more than 250 Covid patients in Swansea Bay hospitals, with another 115 recovering patients. This is about a third of all patients. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned the Welsh NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"" whenthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Waleson Saturday. Mr Gething said the Welsh NHS had experienced one of its busiest weekends of 2020 as it dealt with a combination of rising Covid cases and winter pressures. He urged people to abide by rules and regulations, adding: ""We need everyone's help to get through what remains of this year."" Covid-19 patients make up nearly 26% of all patients in hospital with 1,992 people in hospital across Wales on Sunday. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant at the new Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, warned the hospital was ""stuffed full with patients with very significant needs"". ""We have reached a tipping point, we have more patients that have Covid than don't have Covid now,"" she said. Dr Sarah Aitken, the health board's interim executive medical director, said there were now 404 patients with confirmed coronavirus in its hospitals - compared to 283 in April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests,"Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges in Wales from January Coronavirus testing is to be rolled out in schools and colleges from January. Pupils and staff identified as close contacts will be offered alateral flow testeach day of a self-isolation period, the Welsh Government said. Those who test negative can continue going to school or college, while those who test positive would self-isolate and book a confirmatory test. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said training for school staff would begin this week and continue in January. He added that testing would not be compulsory. But Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said the plan to roll it out next term was ""laughable"". She said: ""The implications for schools to mass test on a national scale is huge. ""For the health minister to say it can be rolled out at the start of next term when the teachers have to carry out the tests and they haven't been trained is laughable."" She added: ""Ministers have an awful lot of work to do to repair the damage that has been done to their relationship with the teaching profession."" Currently, pupils and staff identified as close contacts from a positive test must self-isolate for 10 days. However, under the new plans they would be asked to either self-isolate as normal or take a lateral flow test at the start of the school day for the duration of their self-isolation period. Schools and colleges will be offered support, equipment and training, and all special school staff will be offered weekly testing. Eithe Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders in Wales, toldBBC Radio Walesthe plan had advantages in reducing the number of people isolating and easing concerns, but she also had questions over how it would work. NHS rapid test use defended amid accuracy concerns Mass testing in Wales' schools considered Wales' secondary school system 'must reinvent itself' Ms Hughes said: ""Then I'd be wondering about why I'm hearing about policy on the media in the last week of term when there's already so much else to be done. ""Then there are some questions around the logistics of actually carrying out this mass testing in essence... if it's a large secondary school and you've got multiple year groups involved, what does that look like for a school every morning for 10 days? ""Then again, if there is a positive, and additional contacts considered, does that mean the process starts again for another 10 days?"" Ms Hughes also questioned how school staff would have time to administer or oversee testing and how schools would find space. She said: ""Where are the teachers and staff who are actually able to have space to oversee this? Teachers at the minute are very thin on the ground and supply staff are very difficult to find. ""Where does the time come from in a working day? ""The principle is laudable and I don't think anybody would say the principle isn't correct, but rolling this out in a school setting could present significant difficulties."" Jackie Parker, head teacher at Crickhowell High School in Powys, said she welcomed the scheme but further details were needed. ""We want to have the minimum disruption we can to have the tests offer some security for families and teachers,"" she said. ""The devil is in the detail... it's working out how we can do this when it's going to be, as far as I know, staff in school doing this [the tests] and obviously there's training, protocol, informing parents of exactly what's happening so we're going to need all the detail and time to prepare. ""Schools have worked miracles over the last few months, as have other key workers, and we will do our very best to facilitate this but I've got 967 students in the school, so a year group bubble may be 150 so it's working out the careful logistics of this."" Ms Parker called for teachers to be vaccinated as key workers so they would not need to undergo testing. ""We would be able to carry on and we want to minimise any disruption in the learning of young people."" Lateral flow Covid-19 tests provide a result in 20-30 minutes Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the rollout has been confirmed following talks with Public Health Wales and the children and schools Technical Advisory Cell. She said the plans would ""play an integral role... to deliver maximum learning with as minimal disruption as possible"". ""We recognise that it has not been easy for pupils and staff who have been required to self-isolate as a result of having been identified as a close contact and we recognise the impact it has had on face-to-face teaching."" Julia James, from Porthcawl, said she was supportive of the plans and would want her daughter, who is currently self-isolating, to receive tests. ""There's no consistency between various schools, some have been hit harder, so it's been quite unfair when it comes to predicting grades,"" she said. ""These tests are only going to help that. ""I don't understand anyone who would not be for it, as long as the teachers are happy as it's going over and above their job description."" Lateral flow testing detects the presence of the Covid-19 viral antigen from a swab sample and produce results within 20 to 30 minutes. Earlier this month,a senior NHS adviser defended the mass use of these testsfollowing concerns about their accuracy. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, accepted there had been ""false negatives"" but stressed the policy was a ""game-changer"". A study found the tests missed 50% of cases and some scientists fear people could start to ignore health advice. Testing is planned to be introduced to all schools and further education settings, including primary and childcare staff, the Welsh Government said, but will be phased on levels of risk, starting with secondary schools and further education institutions. Mr Gething said testing by itself ""cannot eradicate the risks associated with contracting and transmitting Covid-19"". ""Testing... needs to be taken alongside other infection prevention control measures, including appropriate social distancing and hand hygiene measures."" He said mass testing in parts of Wales would ""help inform how we can successfully deliver lateral flow testing in schools and other education settings in the future"".

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Contact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls',"The test and trace system in England has come in for a lot of flak, not only for being slow to get started, but also for failing to trace a large proportion of the contacts of people who receive a positive Covid test. As many have noted, the system turned out not to be ""world-beating"" after all. But one contact tracer argues here that the public has so far escaped its share of the blame. I want to speak out about NHS Test and Trace due to my increasing frustration with the public's lack of co-operation with the system. There is much media criticism and while a lot of it may be justified, it isn't particularly helpful as it deflects attention from the very real problem of lack of public engagement - the negative narrative around Test and Trace simply enables people to justify their selfish behaviour. I would say 70% of calls I have made go unanswered. It shocks and angers me that so many people just don't care. In my normal day job I'm a front-line NHS nurse in an acute hospital but since July I've also been working as a clinical case worker for NHS Test and Trace, to earn extra money because my partner's business had to close. My role is to call people who have tested positive for Covid to collect information, offer support and advice, and identify other individuals at risk of catching and spreading the virus. The process begins with someone taking a Covid test. Results are sent via text or email, and if positive, the individual is invited to fill in the NHS Test and Trace form, asking for details of contacts. These contacts are then called by case workers and told how long they need to isolate. If the Test and Trace form is not filled in, a reminder is sent after eight hours. If there is still no response, or if only a landline number has been provided, then the person with a positive test result is called by a case worker, who asks for information about the person's contacts. Some case workers focus particularly on complicated cases, such as those involving care homes, schools and hospital staff. In all honesty, I have been shocked and disgusted by my experience. The most common negative experiences include frustration at unanswered calls, calls going to voicemail repeatedly, calls being blocked, phones being slammed down when you introduce yourself, and sometimes an unpleasant attitude when the call does get answered. People are called 10 or even 15 times before they are marked as a failed follow-up. Every unsuccessful call has to be documented, further wasting our time. Very few people could genuinely think it's a scam. When a call goes to voicemail we leave a message explaining that we are from Test and Trace, giving the number we are calling from and asking the individual to look out for calls from that number. They are also invited to check this information on the gov.uk website. When someone has actually answered the phone, I've had a few shocking exchanges. For example, when I asked one person to go through the questions with me, the answer was: ""Oh I can't just now - because I'm in Starbucks."" Now, this person has had a positive test and should be isolating. They've had a text telling them they are Covid-positive, yet they are still out in Starbucks infecting other people! Some downright refuse to give details of their contacts. Others are unavailable because, despite their positive test result, they have gone to work. One person I spoke to had tested positive after losing her sense of smell and taste, and she carried on going to work anyway, as she felt OK. She worked as a hairdresser... Let that sink in. A middle-aged man who should have been isolating at home was out several times when I called. A young girl pretended, rather badly, to be him. Inside Test and Trace - how the 'world-beater' went wrong How does Covid-19 Test and Trace work? 'I spoke to one person in four months' More disturbing has been the abuse I have received down the phone: people shouting, ""How dare you call me? This is all a scam!"" Some people have objected, for some reason, to the ""tone"" of the voicemail messages they have received, or expressed anger about the number of calls. Worse still are threats, such as, ""I'm going to come and find you and sort you out."" No-one deserves abuse for trying to do their job. It seems that more and more people are denying the seriousness of the current situation - just because they weren't very ill they decide it's a hoax. Such responses are disheartening and also frightening. People seem so utterly selfish and entitled - so much so that I sometimes feel I no longer want to work as a case worker, and maybe not even as a nurse. I think I've had enough of people. I have, it's true, spoken to a small number of lovely, helpful people but these have sadly been few and far between. Three other test and trace staff who contacted the BBC corroborated the picture painted by the author of this article. They added: ""The system's improved. There are fewer people getting called 80 times. But we still have people not wanting to engage. A woman I called at 10:30 on a Sunday morning said she wanted compensation from the NHS for being called so early."" ""The idea that the service touted as 'world-beating' is actually a complete mess has an all too poisonous effect. Trust is near zero. Why would people agree to comply with a system which may appear to be a complete failure?"" ""I've had people answer the phone and say they cannot talk because they are at work or members of a household answer a landline and tell me the person I need to speak to isn't there. This has become less common now, in my experience - but the number of people simply not answering the phone has risen."" I'm not trying to suggest that Test and Trace is perfect. The training for my role could certainly have been better; when you train for NHS 111 you get an opportunity to practise with mock and scenario calls, which would have been very useful with Test and Trace, to get to grips with the various software programs. I find that every week brings changes to the systems and procedures and it can be difficult to keep up - but this is a constantly changing situation so it is hard to know whether this criticism is justifiable. I have a low opinion of the government's handling of this pandemic - some terrible decisions have been taken. And when it comes to test and trace the lack of public engagement has not been helped by the likes of Dominic Cummings, Stanley Johnson and Margaret Ferrier. But the public has a huge role to play in making this work. I'd like to know why an individual goes to the trouble and discomfort of getting tested, if they are not going to engage with the follow-up? Test and Trace needed the public to work with and support it for it to have real impact. It doesn't matter how effective a system is if people won't pick up the phone. A Department of Health and Social Care representative said: ""In five months we have built the largest diagnostics network in UK history from scratch, informing millions of people whether they have Covid-19 and whether they should self-isolate. More than 43 million tests have been carried out and more than three million people in England have been contacted and notified to self-isolate. ""Turnaround times have been steadily improving over recent weeks and improvements to the contact tracing website, and to the process for contacting household members, have led to substantial improvements in the number of contacts reached.""

London theatres 'devastated' by news,"Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December in the West End London theatres have been given the ""devastating news"" that they must shut again as the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions. A number of West End shows had restarted over the last two weeks. The Society of London Theatre said the move would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he knew it would have a ""huge impact"" but that the government ""must act quickly"". The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Pantoland at the London Palladium on Friday Socially distanced performances to smaller audiences had been allowed in London since the last national lockdown ended. Shows that had opened included Six the Musical, Love Letters, Everybody's Talking About Jamie and a concert version of Les Miserables starring Michael Ball and Alfie Boe. ""It was nice while it lasted,""tweeted Carrie Hope Fletcher,external, who was also part of the Les Miserables cast at the Sondheim Theatre. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, whose shows include Les Miserables, said the government's ""sudden volt[e] face"" was ""devastating for both the theatre and the economy"". ""The constant changes of rules and advice we have received is impossible for any business to react to,"" he continued. ""Where is the leadership this government promised?"" He now had ""no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen"", he added. Alfie Boe plays Jean Valjean in the Cameron Mackintosh production Andrew Lloyd Webber, who owns the London Palladium, said it seemed ""arbitrary and unfair"" that theatre performances were being banned while shopping could continue. But he said he ""reluctantly"" agrees with the decision to put London into tier three. Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary, Elaine Paige, Ashley Banjo and Nigel Havers, was among the other shows to have opened. On Friday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took their three children to a special performance of the production. Producer Michael Harrisonannounced on Twitter,externalthat its ""final"" two performances would take place on Tuesday and criticised the government's ""yo-young approach on advice"". He said: ""It is not possible for any business to function in an environment where our leaders seem to have no idea how our country will look from one week to the next."" The National Theatre will also have to close Dick Whittington, only the second pantomime it has ever staged. London to enter tier 3 Covid rules from Wednesday Cambridges make red carpet debut as family of five Prince 'praying' that live venues can reopen Actress Elaine Paige said she was disappointed that the theatre has to close, asking in a tweet why it was theatres were closing when Tube journeys and flights were still allowed. ""These rules are illogical,"" she said. ""The audience response shows how desperate they are for 2hrs of escapism. If its so terrible - cancel Christmas!"" The Society of London Theatre's chief executive Julian Bird said the announcement was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"". ""The past few days have seen venues beginning to reopen with high levels of Covid security, welcoming back enthusiastic, socially distanced audiences,"" he said. ""Theatres across London will now be forced to postpone or cancel planned performances, causing catastrophic financial difficulties for venues, producers and thousands of industry workers."" Death Drop at the Garrick Theatre is another show affected He urged the government to ""recognise the huge strain this has placed on the sector and look at rapid compensation to protect theatres and their staff over Christmas in all areas of the country"" that are in tier three. Mr Dowden said the rules had been tightened because the capital's rising coronavirus figures were ""deeply concerning"". The remaining Â£400m from the government's Culture Recovery Fund would ""be there to help those affected by [the] changes"", he promised. Allow Twitter content?

Jon Morgan, director of the Theatres Trust, called London's move into tier three ""a disaster"" for the sector. ""Theatres have worked incredibly hard to create safe environments for audiences and through no fault of their own will now face enormous financial losses,"" he said. He called for a government-backed insurance scheme for theatres, a request that was echoed by Sonia Friedman, producer of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and other shows. She said: ""London going into tier three is yet another blow for British theatre - one it simply cannot afford after a brutal year, and one that both could and should have been avoided. ""This feels like a final straw,"" she said of the latest measures, calling them ""proof that this government does not understand theatre and the existential crisis it is facing"".

Andy Barnes and Kenny Wax said they and their fellow producers were ""being penalised for reopening the sector and rejuvenating the West End"". The move into tier three will also see cinemas and other entertainment venues forced to close their doors. The measures will have an impact on the UK release of Wonder Woman 1984, which is due to hit cinemas on Wednesday. A government spokesperson pointed to its Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund and said it remains ""completely committed"" to supporting the arts industry during the pandemic. They added: ""We held back Â£400m of contingency funding so we could respond to the changing public health context and will now use it to support organisations facing financial distress as a result of closure, as well as helping them transition back to fuller opening in the spring.""

How close is light at end of Covid tunnel?,"The roll out of the biggest vaccination programme in the history of the UK is under way. This week, some GP practices in England will join the major hospitals in starting to offer the jab. The plan is to immunise all over-50s plus younger adults with underlying health conditions. The rest of the population could then follow suit. But how long will all this take? Vaccinating 55 million people - children are not being considered for the jab at this stage - is a mammoth task. It will take many months, perhaps the best part of a year. There is currently one vaccine approved for use - made by Pfizer and BioNTech. The UK has managed to order 40 million doses of the vaccine, enough to cover 20 million people given that two doses are needed. So - in the short term at least - the UK will require another vaccine to be approved for use. Fortunately, the regulators are assessing the merits of two more, including one made by US firm Moderna. But the problem with that one is the UK has been able to order only seven million doses - and the earliest they can be supplied is spring. That is why so much hope is pinned on a vaccine produced by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. There are already between five million and 10 million doses waiting go to with a total of 100 million on order - again two doses are needed so that's enough for 50 million people, which combined with the Pfizer jab means there should be enough for the whole population next year. Will it be approved? It will be a surprise if it isn't. The team behind it are confident, stressing they had met all the criteria for approval when the full data behind the clinical trials was published in the Lancet this week. Much was made of the fact that it does not appear to be as effective at stopping infection as the Pfizer vaccine - 70% v 95% effective - but what both do at close to 100% levels is stop serious illness. If people are not dying from Covid or being left with long-term problems, the most dire consequences of the pandemic are over. What is more, roll out will be easier with the Oxford vaccine. That's because it does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage like the Pfizer one, which has resulted in strict rules around its movement. For example, the NHS is still not able to take it into care homes, despite residents and staff being the top priority for vaccination, while GPs have only three and a half days to use up doses when they get delivered. It is, says one GP, ""a logistical nightmare"" to work with. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Vaccine manufacture is notorious for not always going smoothly. Indeed, Pfizer has already had to reduce the amount it is expected to deliver to the UK - it is being shipped in from Belgium. Originally 10 million doses were forecast by the end of 2020, but now the government has been told to expect only five million - and only 800,000 of that is currently in the country, making Health Secretary Matt Hancock's aim of vaccinating ""millions by Christmas"" looking like a stretch. The Oxford vaccine is made in the UK, so from that point of view supply should be more reliable. However, production will still depend on the right ingredients being available, and with a global race to produce vaccines now well under way, it would be amazing if that did not mean a few hiccups along the way. Another potential hurdle is Brexit. A no-deal Brexit could cause problems importing all sorts of goods, especially through the Calais-to-Dover shipping route. The government says it has identified secure routes to get essential goods into the country. But concerns obviously remain. All this combined is why Dr Richard Vautrey, who is the British Medical Association's GP leader, says supply is probably the biggest ""risk factor"" to roll out. He says if there is enough vaccine, he is ""confident"" GPs and their practice nurses could vaccinate millions of people a week. Vaccination on a mass scale is dependent on people coming forward. Many fear achieving good uptake is not a given because people may refuse to be vaccinated - it will not be compulsory. Ipsos Mori and King's College Londonlooked at this over the summer,external. Their survey of more than 2,000 adults was reported to have found just half of people were planning to get vaccinated. The truth though is somewhat more nuanced. If you add in those who said they were fairly likely, the numbers jumped to nearly three-quarters. What is more, the older age groups were the least likely to say they would shun the vaccine. Understandably so, as they are the most at risk. More than nine in 10 deaths are among the over-65s - and this is really the crucial issue when it comes to the vaccine programme, and how quickly it will return life to normal. There are 12 million over-65s. Once significant numbers are vaccinated, the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed disappears and the high number of excess deaths being seen across the population dwindles. How long will that take? Well, GPs managed to vaccinate the over-65 population against flu in a little over two months this autumn - 77% came forward for the jab. The flu jab is given in only one dose, but doctors believe it should be perfectly possible to finish immunisation for every person over 65 who is willing to have the vaccine by the end of March, availability permitting. That would then trigger - or at least give the option of triggering - a major relaxation of restrictions. It is what the UK government's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty referred to as ""de-risking"" this week, when he appeared before MPs at the Health Select Committee. His point was that we could quickly reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid was at a level society could ""tolerate"" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year. That would allow a gradual move away from the most severe restrictions, he says, perhaps just requiring a bit of continued social distancing and the wearing of face-coverings in some settings. Spring may not be the end of the pandemic, but it certainly should be the beginning of the end.

Where are schools closing early for Christmas?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

'New variant' of coronavirus identified - Hancock,"A new variant of coronavirus has been found which is growing faster in some parts of England, MPs have been told. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at least 60 different local authorities had recorded Covid infections caused by the new variant. He said the World Health Organization had been notified and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. He said there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. This video can not be played A new variant of Covid could be speeding up the spread of cases in parts of south east England, says Matt Hancock. He told MPs in the House of Commons that over the last week, there had been sharp, exponential rises in coronavirus infections across London, Kent, parts of Essex and Hertfordshire. ""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the South of England although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. ""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."" England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said current coronavirus swab tests would detect the new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas in recent weeks. The changes or mutations involve the spike protein of the virus - the part that helps it infect cells, and the target Covid vaccines are designed around. It is too soon to know exactly what this will do to the behaviour of the virus. Prof Alan McNally, an expert at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC: ""Let's not be hysterical. It doesn't mean it's more transmissible or more infectious or dangerous. ""It is something to keep an eye on. ""Huge efforts are ongoing at characterising the variant and understanding its emergence. It is important to keep a calm and rational perspective on the strain as this is normal virus evolution and we expect new variants to come and go and emerge over time."" Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said it was potentially serious. ""The surveillance and research must continue and we must take the necessary steps to stay ahead of the virus."" There is a simple rule for understanding all ""new strain"" or ""new variants"": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the ""scare"" but not the ""answer"". Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England. This is not the same as saying it ""is causing"" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily. New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is. Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at Nottingham University, said: ""The genetic information in many viruses can change very rapidly and sometimes these changes can benefit the virus - by allowing it to transmit more efficiently or to escape from vaccines or treatments - but many changes have no effect at all. ""Even though a new genetic variant of the virus has emerged and is spreading in many parts of the UK and across the world, this can happen purely by chance. ""Therefore, it is important that we study any genetic changes as they occur, to work out if they are affecting how the virus behaves, and until we have done that important work it is premature to make any claims about the potential impacts of virus mutation.""

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

'I've lost two stone because I can't get food',"Dr Caroline Gould (PhD) says people with disabilities have been given little consideration during the pandemic - particularly in rural areas Once a month before the pandemic, Dr Caroline Gould said she would take a 200-mile round trip to acquire all the groceries needed for her bespoke diet. A resident of Broadford on the Isle of Skye, Caroline has a severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which means her body lacks collagen and her joints are prone to dislocating. On average, she said she has between 40 and 50 joint dislocations or partial dislocations per day. In addition to this condition, Caroline has other health problems and keeps to a very strict diet. She buys food from a number of different shops around the island - a routine that has been significantly disrupted throughout the pandemic. ""I've now lost around two stone (12.7kg) in weight,"" she told the BBC. ""My condition affects my whole body including my digestive system which is why I have to eat a very restricted diet - and I also have an allergic reaction which has meant that I have had to cut out processed foods. ""My condition also affects all soft tissue - tendons, muscles, ligaments, skin, etc. and my heart. It also causes me to have swallowing problems, choking problems, etc. ""A lot of time has been spent searching online trying to find certain foodstuffs. I simply couldn't get the foods I needed. It has been really stressful and difficult."" Caroline uses a wheelchair with a recline function to ease the pain of dislocations Aprevious BBC investigationheard that not enough consideration was given to disabled people and their complex needs when lockdown came into effect - and this was having a continued impact over the summer. Caroline, who was one of the 180,000 people in Scotland shielding from March, said this was particularly evident in rural communities which have less frequent grocery deliveries than cities. In her area she said there were lots of small shops, but not all are accessible - and while some do deliveries, they ""don't hold big enough stock"" to meet everyone's needs. Coronavirus lockdown: 'I have never felt so blind before' 'I have lost care support because of coronavirus' ""People in rural situations haven't been thought of by people in cities who make the decisions,"" she said. ""They just seem to have assumed if it works in the city, it works everywhere else. ""Only one supermarket delivers to the door in some of Skye - not all of Skye. ""I think there's been very little indication by either Westminster or Scottish governments that they show any understanding for disabled people."" As an accessibility auditor for Skye and Lochalsh, Caroline regularly hears about the experiences of vulnerable people and those with disabilities in the local community. She said because it was common for people in rural areas to have multiple part-time jobs, people who required home care on Skye had chosen to reduce their service in case carers picked up the virus elsewhere. Caroline also said she and others had struggled to get information from the NHS about their care because staff were ""so busy"" dealing with the pandemic. She said: ""I think the thing a lot of people have had to cope with has been loneliness. ""A lot of the feeling that I'm getting from other disabled people contacting me, is they feel their life has no value and their needs haven't been considered and they have struggled and struggled and struggled."" Over the course of the pandemic the BBC has heard from many people living with disabilities about the difficulties they have faced as a direct or indirect result of measures put in place to cope with coronavirus. Disability lawyer Daniel Donaldson, principal solicitor at Legal Spark, has now said he will ""likely"" pursue a judicial review of the Scottish government's actions which allegedly discriminate against disabled people. He told the BBC that the government had failed to carry out the law in line with the Equality Act and effectively ""retrograded disability equality"". ""We're back in the position we were in in 1970s,"" he said. ""That's all a consequence of government and other public authorities ignoring the Equality Act and being able to get away with it because no one is willing to enforce legislation."" Even out with the pandemic, Caroline is reminded of equality issues in her daily work assessing the accessibility of services - she is concerned that Scotland is failing to make basic standards ""future proof"". She said: ""I think it's going to be very difficult for disabled people to get their rights. The minimum building standards only allow a 1.5 metre turning circle for a wheelchair yet we have wheelchairs here that use 2.2 metre turning circles.

'I've lost two stone because I can't get food'Caroline Gould says disabled people in rural areas have been given little consideration during the pandemic.Highlands & Islands,"Dr Caroline Gould (PhD) says people with disabilities have been given little consideration during the pandemic - particularly in rural areas Once a month before the pandemic, Dr Caroline Gould said she would take a 200-mile round trip to acquire all the groceries needed for her bespoke diet. A resident of Broadford on the Isle of Skye, Caroline has a severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which means her body lacks collagen and her joints are prone to dislocating. On average, she said she has between 40 and 50 joint dislocations or partial dislocations per day. In addition to this condition, Caroline has other health problems and keeps to a very strict diet. She buys food from a number of different shops around the island - a routine that has been significantly disrupted throughout the pandemic. ""I've now lost around two stone (12.7kg) in weight,"" she told the BBC. ""My condition affects my whole body including my digestive system which is why I have to eat a very restricted diet - and I also have an allergic reaction which has meant that I have had to cut out processed foods. ""My condition also affects all soft tissue - tendons, muscles, ligaments, skin, etc. and my heart. It also causes me to have swallowing problems, choking problems, etc. ""A lot of time has been spent searching online trying to find certain foodstuffs. I simply couldn't get the foods I needed. It has been really stressful and difficult."" Caroline uses a wheelchair with a recline function to ease the pain of dislocations Aprevious BBC investigationheard that not enough consideration was given to disabled people and their complex needs when lockdown came into effect - and this was having a continued impact over the summer. Caroline, who was one of the 180,000 people in Scotland shielding from March, said this was particularly evident in rural communities which have less frequent grocery deliveries than cities. In her area she said there were lots of small shops, but not all are accessible - and while some do deliveries, they ""don't hold big enough stock"" to meet everyone's needs.

"All Windrush victims to get at least Â£10,000People wrongly threatened with deportation previously received a minimum of Â£250.","This video can not be played Priti Patel says she âalways promised to listen and actâ and that it was her mission to âcorrect the wrongs of the pastâ. The government is to give more money to victims of the Windrush scandal, which saw hundreds of people wrongly threatened with deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the minimum payment will rise from Â£250 to Â£10,000, and the maximum from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000. The figure will be higher still in ""exceptional"" circumstances, with money coming through quicker than before. The Windrush scandal mainly affected UK citizens originally from the Caribbean. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when ""hostile environment"" immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under then Home Secretary Theresa May. UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? The scandal broke in 2018, including the revelation that many of those affected had lost homes and jobs and had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The BBC's Westminster Hour reported last month that at least nine people had died while awaiting payments under the compensation scheme set up for victims. By Jack Fenwick, Westminster Hour Campaigners for the Windrush victims are likely to ask why this announcement by the home secretary didn't come sooner. The government acted quickly in setting up the Windrush Compensation Scheme when the scandal became public in 2018, but that scheme has long been criticised for being too slow and resulting in offers some say are too low. The speed at which claims are processed and money is offered is seen as being particularly crucial, given that many of those affected are elderly. The additional announcement that the compensation process for loss of earnings will also change could potentially lead to even larger payouts for victims. Early responses from claimants suggest a sense of cautious optimism at the latest announcement, with one person telling me they won't believe it until a cheque is in the post. The Windrush Compensation Scheme will be updated following consultation with the Windrush Working Group, chaired by Bishop Derek Webley. Ms Patel told the House of Commons there would be ""substantial changes"". She added that these would ""make a real difference to people's lives"", saying: ""I've always promised to listen and act to ensure that the victims of Windrush receive the maximum amount of compensation they deserve. ""It's my mission to correct the wrongs of the past and I will continue to work with the Windrush Working Group to do exactly that."" The changes to the scheme will apply retrospectively, meaning those previously given less than Â£10,000 will receive top-up payments. The Home Office is also removing the 12 months' salary limit on compensation for earnings lost by people forced out of their jobs. It will start letting those affected by the changes know from next week. Bishop Webley said: ""Many will benefit from the relief that these new payments will provide, and begin to move forward with their lives with hope and determination."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report last month said government action taken to ""record and respond to negative equality impacts"" of hostile environment immigration policies had been ""perfunctory, and therefore insufficient"". It called for a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"", with the commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, describing the treatment of the Windrush generation as ""a shameful stain on British history"". The Windrush compensation scheme came into force last year, with Â£2m being paid out so far and a further Â£1m offered.

"'New variant' of coronavirus identified - HancockNew variant of coronavirus identified, and it may be associated with faster spread in south of England, UK Health Secretary says","A new variant of coronavirus has been found which is growing faster in some parts of England, MPs have been told. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at least 60 different local authorities had recorded Covid infections caused by the new variant. He said the World Health Organization had been notified and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. He said there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. This video can not be played A new variant of Covid could be speeding up the spread of cases in parts of south east England, says Matt Hancock. He told MPs in the House of Commons that over the last week, there had been sharp, exponential rises in coronavirus infections across London, Kent, parts of Essex and Hertfordshire. ""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the South of England although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. ""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."" England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said current coronavirus swab tests would detect the new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas in recent weeks. The changes or mutations involve the spike protein of the virus - the part that helps it infect cells, and the target Covid vaccines are designed around. It is too soon to know exactly what this will do to the behaviour of the virus. Prof Alan McNally, an expert at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC: ""Let's not be hysterical. It doesn't mean it's more transmissible or more infectious or dangerous. ""It is something to keep an eye on. ""Huge efforts are ongoing at characterising the variant and understanding its emergence. It is important to keep a calm and rational perspective on the strain as this is normal virus evolution and we expect new variants to come and go and emerge over time."" Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of Wellcome, said it was potentially serious. ""The surveillance and research must continue and we must take the necessary steps to stay ahead of the virus."" There is a simple rule for understanding all ""new strain"" or ""new variants"": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the ""scare"" but not the ""answer"". Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England. This is not the same as saying it ""is causing"" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily. New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is. Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at Nottingham University, said: ""The genetic information in many viruses can change very rapidly and sometimes these changes can benefit the virus - by allowing it to transmit more efficiently or to escape from vaccines or treatments - but many changes have no effect at all. ""Even though a new genetic variant of the virus has emerged and is spreading in many parts of the UK and across the world, this can happen purely by chance. ""Therefore, it is important that we study any genetic changes as they occur, to work out if they are affecting how the virus behaves, and until we have done that important work it is premature to make any claims about the potential impacts of virus mutation.""

"Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' John le CarrÃ©Writers including Robert Harris and Ian Rankin remember an author ""who transcended his genre"".Entertainment & Arts","John le CarrÃ© (centre) at the 2011 UK premiere of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Authors, actors and admirers have paid tribute to the late John le CarrÃ©, the best-selling British spy writer who has died from pneumonia at the age of 89. Ian Rankin praised his fellow writer for taking his chosen genre of spy fiction ""into the realm of literature"". Author Robert Harris agreed, describing le CarrÃ© as ""a writer of immense quality"" who ""transcended his genre"". Le CarrÃ©'s best-known works included The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Fatherland author Harris told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You only have to read a page and you know it's le CarrÃ©"". His books would ""still be read in a hundred years"", Harris added. Susanne Bier, who directed the 2016 TV adaptation of le CarrÃ©'s 1993 thriller The Night Manager, told Today he had been an ""incredibly contemporary"" author. ""Even his old novels have totally current resonance,"" she said, describing his prose as ""exciting, thrilling and deeply romantic"". How fact met fiction in Le CarrÃ©'s secret world Obituary: John le CarrÃ© John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89 Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, historian Ben Macintyre praised le CarrÃ© for his insights into ""the knotted timbre of human personality"". ""He was often described as spy writer, but he was far more than that,"" he said. ""He was really a student and expert in the human condition."" Macintyre described the late author's novels as ""neatly plotted, beautifully written examinations of the human character"". ""The world of espionage was a perfect backdrop for profound psychological examinations on why people behave how they do,"" he added. John le CarrÃ© with Susanne Bier (second from right) and the cast of The Night Manager in 2016 Scottish writer Rankin told BBC Breakfast le CarrÃ© had lived ""an extraordinary life"" and that authors like himself ""lived in his shadow"". Rankin also revealed he had once ""used a bit of spycraft"" himself to obtain le CarrÃ©'s autograph at an event at the House of Lords. ""It was 1988 and he had no idea who I was,"" he recalled. ""I went up to him, said I was collecting everyone's signatures as a memento. Really, though, his was the only signature I wanted."" Actress Florence Pugh, meanwhile, revealed she had once jokingly called the author ""an old fart"". The pair met during the shooting of the 2018 TV adaptation of le CarrÃ©'s 1983 novel The Little Drummer Girl, in which Pugh starred. ""I watched his eyes light up with glee and we both cackled until we cried,"" the British Oscar nominee recalled on Instagram. ""He peered at me over his glass and giggled, 'I think we're going to get along just fine.' We knew a magical friendship had arrived."" Allow Instagram content?

Born in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, le CarrÃ© worked in undercover intelligence before publishing his his first novel, Call For The Dead, in 1961. His third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. He is best known for creating spymaster Smiley, who appeared in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and several other novels. ""We will not see his like again,"" sad his agent Jonny Gellerin a statement confirming the author's death,external. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent I only met John le CarrÃ© once. A brief chat on the red carpet at the premiere of the film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in 2011. A three-minute experience I'd been looking forward to for months. I discovered his novels relatively late in life. My first was Tinker, Tailor, which I found so enthralling that at one point I was buying a new le CarrÃ© every week. I loved his style of storytelling - his ability to create vivid and believable characters in situations that may have been far from our own more mundane experiences, but which still felt utterly relatable. So when a few years ago I was asked if I was interested in taking part in Celebrity Mastermind, I suggested as my specialist subject the author's George Smiley novels. Le CarrÃ©'s complete body of work would have been a mammoth task. But the novels featuring his most famous and enduring creation seemed more manageable. His Smiley books had always been my favourites. So it was also a great and welcome reason to spend a few weeks revisiting some of the stories I'd enjoyed so much over the previous decade, from early work like A Murder of Quality (not a spy story at all - Smiley is asked to investigate a death at an exclusive public school) to later books like Smiley's People (where the spymaster goes into final battle against his Soviet nemesis Karla). I luckily didn't embarrass myself on the show, only fluffing one question. And at the end of the programme I came a creditable second to the formidable crime writer Val McDermid. On the red carpet, I do remember discussing with le CarrÃ© whether his best-known piece of work was Tinker, Tailor or The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The rest is a bit of a blur. In my job I'm lucky enough to meet a lot of famous, well-known figures, it's a routine part of the work we do. But unusually for weeks afterwards I remember being unable to stop myself endlessly telling friends and colleagues, with a huge smile and sense of pride, that I'd finally met the great John le CarrÃ©.

the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' John le CarrÃ©","John le CarrÃ© (centre) at the 2011 UK premiere of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Authors, actors and admirers have paid tribute to the late John le CarrÃ©, the best-selling British spy writer who has died from pneumonia at the age of 89. Ian Rankin praised his fellow writer for taking his chosen genre of spy fiction ""into the realm of literature"". Author Robert Harris agreed, describing le CarrÃ© as ""a writer of immense quality"" who ""transcended his genre"". Le CarrÃ©'s best-known works included The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Fatherland author Harris told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You only have to read a page and you know it's le CarrÃ©"". His books would ""still be read in a hundred years"", Harris added. Susanne Bier, who directed the 2016 TV adaptation of le CarrÃ©'s 1993 thriller The Night Manager, told Today he had been an ""incredibly contemporary"" author. ""Even his old novels have totally current resonance,"" she said, describing his prose as ""exciting, thrilling and deeply romantic"". How fact met fiction in Le CarrÃ©'s secret world Obituary: John le CarrÃ© John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89 Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, historian Ben Macintyre praised le CarrÃ© for his insights into ""the knotted timbre of human personality"". ""He was often described as spy writer, but he was far more than that,"" he said. ""He was really a student and expert in the human condition."" Macintyre described the late author's novels as ""neatly plotted, beautifully written examinations of the human character"". ""The world of espionage was a perfect backdrop for profound psychological examinations on why people behave how they do,"" he added. John le CarrÃ© with Susanne Bier (second from right) and the cast of The Night Manager in 2016 Scottish writer Rankin told BBC Breakfast le CarrÃ© had lived ""an extraordinary life"" and that authors like himself ""lived in his shadow"". Rankin also revealed he had once ""used a bit of spycraft"" himself to obtain le CarrÃ©'s autograph at an event at the House of Lords. ""It was 1988 and he had no idea who I was,"" he recalled. ""I went up to him, said I was collecting everyone's signatures as a memento. Really, though, his was the only signature I wanted."" Actress Florence Pugh, meanwhile, revealed she had once jokingly called the author ""an old fart"". The pair met during the shooting of the 2018 TV adaptation of le CarrÃ©'s 1983 novel The Little Drummer Girl, in which Pugh starred. ""I watched his eyes light up with glee and we both cackled until we cried,"" the British Oscar nominee recalled on Instagram. ""He peered at me over his glass and giggled, 'I think we're going to get along just fine.' We knew a magical friendship had arrived."" Allow Instagram content?

Pointless star and author Richard Osman said,externalhe had been ""the finest, wisest storyteller we had"" and thanked him ""for a lifetime of tales"".

Born in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, le CarrÃ© worked in undercover intelligence before publishing his his first novel, Call For The Dead, in 1961. His third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. He is best known for creating spymaster Smiley, who appeared in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and several other novels. ""We will not see his like again,"" sad his agent Jonny Gellerin a statement confirming the author's death,external. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent I only met John le CarrÃ© once. A brief chat on the red carpet at the premiere of the film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in 2011. A three-minute experience I'd been looking forward to for months. I discovered his novels relatively late in life. My first was Tinker, Tailor, which I found so enthralling that at one point I was buying a new le CarrÃ© every week. I loved his style of storytelling - his ability to create vivid and believable characters in situations that may have been far from our own more mundane experiences, but which still felt utterly relatable. So when a few years ago I was asked if I was interested in taking part in Celebrity Mastermind, I suggested as my specialist subject the author's George Smiley novels. Le CarrÃ©'s complete body of work would have been a mammoth task. But the novels featuring his most famous and enduring creation seemed more manageable. His Smiley books had always been my favourites. So it was also a great and welcome reason to spend a few weeks revisiting some of the stories I'd enjoyed so much over the previous decade, from early work like A Murder of Quality (not a spy story at all - Smiley is asked to investigate a death at an exclusive public school) to later books like Smiley's People (where the spymaster goes into final battle against his Soviet nemesis Karla). I luckily didn't embarrass myself on the show, only fluffing one question. And at the end of the programme I came a creditable second to the formidable crime writer Val McDermid. On the red carpet, I do remember discussing with le CarrÃ© whether his best-known piece of work was Tinker, Tailor or The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The rest is a bit of a blur. In my job I'm lucky enough to meet a lot of famous, well-known figures, it's a routine part of the work we do. But unusually for weeks afterwards I remember being unable to stop myself endlessly telling friends and colleagues, with a huge smile and sense of pride, that I'd finally met the great John le CarrÃ©.

The carol service - held outside because of Covid restrictions - had just ended when the shooting began.Cathedral staff wrote on Facebook,externalthat the man had ""set off a round of gunfire into the air"" from the front steps. Officers fired 15 rounds at the gunman ""Everybody is in shock,""cathedral spokeswoman Lisa Schubert told the New York Times,external. ""There were hundreds of people here, and he shot at least 20 times."" Three officers nearby fired 15 rounds at the suspect after he began to shoot, the commissioner said.

Second Welsh health board stops some non-urgent care,"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"".

Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plant,"Sizewell C (lighter grey on the right) would be built next to Sizewell B, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned The government has begun talks with EDF about the construction of a new Â£20bn nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The Sizewell C site could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to provide 7% of the UK's needs. But it has proved controversial with campaigners saying it is ""ridiculously expensive"" and that taxpayers will have to foot the bill for extra costs. The government said any deal would be subject to approval on areas such as value for money and affordability. EDF, the French energy giant, is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear energy plant in Somerset in partnership with China General Nuclear Power. The government said talks with EDF about Sizewell C would depend on the progress of the Hinkley Point C. However,that project is set to cost up to Â£2.9bn more than originally thoughtand will be up to 15 months late. China General Nuclear Power has a 20% stake in Sizewell C but is thought to be planning to pull out after security concerns were raised about a Chinese state-owned company designing and running its own design nuclear reactor on UK soil. If it does pull out, it would increase the need for new investors. One option could be for the government to take a stake in the plant. Power plant bosses 'are listening to locals' Automatic switching plan for fairer energy tariffs UK climate plan: What do the terms mean? Monday's announcement is part of the long-awaited Energy White Paper, which ministers say will support up to 220,000 jobs over the next decade. The paper sets out specific steps to cut emissions from industry, transport and buildings. The policies should remove 230 million metric tonnes of emissions, which is equivalent to taking 7.5 million petrol cars off the road, the government says. The paper outlines a policy to boost competition in the energy retail market to tackle the ""loyalty penalty"" in which long-standing customers pay more than new ones. It will also provide at least Â£6.7bn in support to the fuel poor and most vulnerable over the next six years.Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plant The government has always been clear that it remains committed to new nuclear power to meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. With other nuclear projects suffering recent setbacks, and an identical plant already under construction in Somerset, Sizewell was the clear front runner to get approval. The high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables like offshore wind make a Â£20bn project like this controversial, but the enormous quantities of low carbon non-intermittent electricity it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out. Any final decision to build the plant will be subject to a full regulatory and planning approval process. Some local opposition groups claim the project will damage the surrounding environment and important wildlife habitats, but there is also local support for the number of high quality jobs it will bring to an area which includes areas of high unemployment. Commenting on the talks with EDF, the government said they would hinge on how Hinkley Point C is progressing, ""and the developer's application of lessons learnt from Hinkley Point C across to Sizewell C from development and design, through construction and commissioning, and into operations"". Hinkley Point is now estimated to cost between Â£21.5bn and Â£22.5bn, with EDF blaming ""challenging ground conditions"". If the Sizewell C plant proceeds, it could create thousands of new jobs during construction and operation, the government said. ""We are starting negotiations with EDF, it is not a green light on the construction,"" Business and Energy Secretary Alok Sharma told the BBC's Today programme. ""The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine,"" he said - referring to the variability of renewable power. Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the news. ""Building new nuclear capacity will give us a vital tool to help meet our global climate obligations,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist. The Nuclear Industry Association's chief executive, Tom Greatrex said: ""Sizewell is a vital next step towards the net zero power mix we need for the future. ""As well as at least 60 years of constantly available clean electricity, this project will provide thousands of highly-skilled, well-paid and long-term jobs across the supply chain, at a time when they are badly needed."" EDF is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset But campaigners hit out at the plans. ""The idea that it could provide value for money is pie in the sky,"" said Alison Downes from the Stop Sizewell C campaign. ""Sizewell C remains too slow and expensive to help our climate emergency, and both the government and any pension funds considering the project must beware the reputational risk of investing in a still unproven reactor design."" Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""When renewables costs are plummeting, it's madness to waste Â£20bn on another nuclear white elephant, ""It will leave consumers with higher bills, destroy important habitats and unlikely to be online till the late 2030s."" Talking about the energy white paper, Mr Sharma said: ""Today's plan establishes a decisive and permanent shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels, towards cleaner energy sources that will put our country at the forefront of the global green industrial revolution."" The paper says that electricity demand will double due to transport and low carbon heat. It proposes that by the mid-2030s, all newly-installed heating systems should be low carbon or to be able to be converted to a clean fuel supply. Co-incidentally, on Monday the government faced criticism over two existing climate policies. The Commons Environmental Audit Committee said the recently-imposed Green Homes Grant to help householders insulate their homes faced serious problems. It said most people had difficulty using the website, and many could not find a contractor to install insulation. Separately, the UK Energy Research Centre - a government-funded consortium of academics - said the government's policy of banning the sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 was insufficient. It said ministers needed to tax such vehicles heavily now, or people would still be buying them in 2029 and running them for a couple of decades.

Byron Bay beach âall but goneâ in Australia storms,"This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay as wild weather batters the country Byron Bay's famous beach has all but disappeared, as extreme weather batters Australia's east coast, officials say. Main Beach - a popular tourist destination - had already been depleted due to previous erosions. But local mayor Simon Richardson said ""severe weather"" and ""massive swells"" were smashing what was left. ""We're watching our beach disappear,"" he said. A 1,000km (620 mile) stretch of coast is being hit with torrential rain and ""abnormally high"" tides. More than 2,000 homes in cities, including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, lost electricity on Monday after strong winds struck power lines. Tides up to 8m (26ft) high were recorded, eroding the shoreline in some areas, including Byron Bay. Emergency services said they had received over 700 calls for help since Sunday. About half a dozen people stranded in floodwaters had been rescued, they added. Meteorologists have warned that this Australian summer will see the impacts of a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones. 'La NiÃ±a' weather event develops in the Pacific Australia warned on future of 'simultaneous' natural disasters The current wild weather has hit popular holiday spots such as the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast in Queensland. In Byron Bay, in the state of New South Wales, pictures showed the beach covered with water and fallen trees. ""We're seeing the largest coastal erosion we've seen in many years, particularly around the Byron Bay area, which is completely changing the entire landscape of the beaches,"" Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steve Pearce told reporters.

"First Scottish care home resident receives vaccineAnnie Innes, 90, from South Lanarkshire, is the first person to be be vaccinated in a care home.ScotlandComments","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First care home resident receives vaccine A 90-year-old woman in South Lanarkshire has become the first care home resident to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Former carer Annie Innes was immunised at Abercorn House in Hamilton. Care home residents across Scotland have been prioritised to receive the vaccine, along with frontline health care staff. Ms Innes told reporters it was ""wonderful"" to get the vaccine just before Christmas. ""I hope it keeps me, my friends here and the staff safe and means we can get back to normal very soon,"" she said. She added: ""The nurses and the care home staff have been great with us and we are relieved to have been offered the vaccine."" Care home vaccinations to begin on Monday Covid vaccinations begin at sites across Scotland When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Health Secretary Jeane Freeman thanked those involved in rolling out the vaccine programme. ""It has been a challenge to get the Pfizer vaccine into care homes because of transport and storage requirements but I am delighted to see Mrs Innes become the first care home resident to receive her vaccine and I wish her many more years of good health,"" she said. ""Throughout the pandemic our priority has been to save lives and keep people safe. Vaccines give us a vital additional layer of protection we haven't had until now."" The second person vaccinated at the care home was 82-year-old Margaret Keating, a former bar tender who has been a resident at Abercorn House for a year. Residents and members of staff at Abercorn House will receive the vital second dose of the vaccine in the new year. Margaret Keating was the second care home resident in the country to be vaccinated Trudi Marshall, nurse director with health and social care North Lanarkshire, who is managing care home vaccination across the region, said they would be able to vaccinate 2,990 care home residents and 5,601 staff across 93 Lanarkshire care homes in the ""quick moving and complex operation"". ""It's important to recognise just how much work our staff have put in to the process in such a short time,"" she said. ""Care home staff and managers also deserve praise for their fantastic co-operation and help."" There were initial fears that care homes would not be able to receive the first batch of the drug because of logistical issues associated with its storage at -70C. More than 65,000 doses have been distributed to vaccination centres across Scotland where they have been ""packed down"" before being diluted for use in care homes. So far more than 5,000 frontline NHS staff and vaccinators have been given the first of two injections of the drug, which cuts cases of Covid by about 95%. The vaccination programme is beginning after themost recent official weekly figures showed,externalthere have been 78 deaths in care homes in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, said there were about 50,000 adults in care homes in Scotland and that prioritising those most in need was key. But he warned the vaccine rollout would be a slow process. Speaking toBBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme, he said: ""This is an tremendously important and positive day for residents, for their family members and also for staff. ""We've had nine months of sheer hell and distress across Scotland's care home sector. This virus has hit the most vulnerable the hardest, and those sadly are individuals in our care homes. ""So this really is the beginning of turning a corner."" Alison Strath, the Scottish government's interim chief pharmaceutical officer had worked ""tirelessly"" with the care home sector to ensure Scotland could be the first country where the vaccine could be taken to residents, he said. ""It is an amazing achievement in such a short space of time, but it will take a long time,"" Dr Macaskill said. He added: ""Practically, we need to work with the fact that we have a supply which is the first phase supply and we need to prioritise those most at risk."" Along with rapid testing, which has begun in some care homes and is also being rolled out across the country from Monday, the vaccines would allow visits to residents to begin to return to normal, he said.

"Scots told to 'cut down contacts' before ChristmasNicola Sturgeon says Scots planning to meet up at Christmas should cut down on ""unnecessary contacts"" now.Scotland","Scots have been urged to ""cut down on unnecessary contacts"" now if they plan to meet up with relatives at Christmas. Rules on household meetings are being eased for five days over the festive period, allowing up to eight people from three households to meet indoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those who choose to do this should cut contacts now to be as safe as possible. She said the ""best Christmas gift we can give family and friends"" is to ""keep our distance and keep them safe"". Ms Sturgeon also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present a ""real risk of transmission"". First care home resident receives vaccine Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Peoplewill be allowed to form Christmas ""bubbles""of three households between 23 and 27 December. Ms Sturgeon said this was a ""pragmatic step"" to make the festive period ""as safe as possible"" for those who feel they must meet up - but has repeatedly urged people not to do it unless absolutely necessary. At her coronavirus briefing on Monday, the first minister said Christmas might be ""the toughest"" point of the pandemic for many, but she added that people In Scotland should ""think really carefully"" about gathering indoors. She said: ""Hopefully next year this will all be a bad memory and we'll be looking forward to a much more normal Christmas. ""What we should be thinking about this Christmas is about ensuring that everyone we love is still there when we get to next Christmas, and that we're not losing more people to Covid along the way."" Ms Sturgeon said people planning to meet up should ""reduce unnecessary contacts between now and then"", particularly if they will be seeing elderly relatives. She suggested people avoid catching up with friends in cafes or car-sharing in the run-up to Christmas. The first minister said: ""By taking precautions to cut down on unnecessary contact then we reduce any chance of getting the virus and inadvertently passing it on."" The first minister also urged people not to hold office Christmas parties, saying they present ""a real risk of transmission"" particularly if alcohol is involved. She said: ""Perhaps think about postponing your Christmas celebration until spring or summer next year, when hopefully we will see some greater normality return to our lives. ""I know all of this is very hard at the end of a horrible year, but these are not normal times and it's important we get through them as safely as possible."" There have been concerns about rising cases of the virus in some parts of the UK, withLondon facing a move to the highest tierof restrictions in England. However, the UK government has said it has ""no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which will allow greater mixing. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""all politicians are right to highlight the risks"" around the festive period. He said: ""This is not a risk-free option - this is an option to allow people to come together to celebrate Christmas, but to do so in a way that will be different to what we have experienced before. ""Let's do it safely - let's allow families as they can to come together in a small way, but know the risks of that and try to minimise the risks."" The Scottish Greens meanwhile said Ms Sturgeon's plea to cut contacts was contradictory to her stance on keeping all schools open. MSP Ross Greer said there was a ""very real chance that teachers could be spending their Christmas day calling pupils and their families to inform them they were a close contact of someone who tested positive and must self-isolate"", calling this a ""failure of leadership"" by the government.

London mayor calls for schools to close early,"Sadiq Khan wants all students to be tested for Covid-19 London's mayor has urged the government to ask all secondary schools and colleges in the capital to shut early ahead of Christmas. In a letter to ministers, Sadiq Khan said he also wanted schools to reopen later in January amid ""significant"" Covid outbreaks in 10 to 19-year-olds. It comes as the BBC was toldLondon was likely to move into tier three. Greenwich and Islington councils are the first in England to urge schools to switch this week to online learning. Council officials in Greenwichhave advised schools to shut from the end of Monday, although some academies will remain open, while Islington schools have been asked to move online from the end of Tuesday. A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was ""vital"" children remained in school until the end of term. The prime minister's official spokesman said not being in school had ""a detrimental impact on learning and other areas of pupils' development"". Regional school commissioner teams were working closely with local authorities to"" keep schools open and keep pupils and staff safe,"" he added. Sadiq Khan also urged the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy outdoor public spaces Mr Khan described the surge in Covid-19 cases in London ""deeply concerning"" and that in the last week, there had been a 75% increase in those aged 10-19 testing positive for the virus. He said ""if the government isn't careful these children will pass on the virus to really vulnerable people because the rules are relaxed"" over Christmas. ""My message to the government is if you can't keep the schools Covid safe in the last few days before Christmas, it's better to err on the side of caution and revert to online teaching for these few days."" In the letter, also sent to the prime minister, he said he wanted regular asymptomatic testing to be extended to everyone who could not work form home as well as students and staff at London's secondary schools, sixth-form college and further education colleges. He has also called for face coverings to be made mandatory in busy outdoor public spaces, ""given the numbers on our high streets in the run-up to Christmas"". ""The rollout of the vaccine has provided some light at the end of what has been a very dark tunnel, but this is no time to be complacent and we cannot let so many months of compromise and sacrifice go to waste,"" he said. ""Time is running out to get the virus under control in our city which is why I urge the government to heed my call and provide us with the extra support we desperately need. Londoners always work together - and together our city will get through the winter and can look forward to better times ahead."" Mr Khan said if London went into further restrictions, the current financial support offered by the government would be ""insufficient to keep many businesses and the self-employed afloat"". He warned if the capital moved to tier three, UK Hospitality predicted Â£2.7bn could be wiped off London's hospitality industry, with 160,000 jobs permanently at risk. Mr Khan said that if London moved to tier three, UK Hospitality had warned Â£2.7bn could be wiped off the capital's hospitality industry ""Theatres and venues in London have begun to reopen, many for the first time since March and after making their venues as safe as possible,"" he wrote. ""Several major Christmas theatre productions are scheduled in December and January in the West End alone. Last-minute cancellations of these could prove ruinous."" Mr Khan said before any additional restrictions are imposed, ministers must set up a compensation scheme for all lost income during the crucial festive period based on last year's returns. He added workers required to self-isolate must also receive full pay and not just statutory sick pay. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked tremendously hard to put protective measures in place that are helping reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted."" The Regional Schools Commissioner for the South East of England and South London would be continuing discussions with Greenwich, he added. Last week it was announced all pupils, their families and teachers in parts of London, Kent and Essex should take a Covid test with extra mobile testing units brought in. It comes as east London and parts of Kent and Essex became some of England's major coronavirus hotspots. Three in four boroughs in the city have registered an increase in Covid-19 cases,figures released last week from the Office of National Statistics show. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it supported Greenwich Council and the mayor in their call for schools to move to online learning. He said: ""The government should have been planning for this weeks ago. ""They have now started to recognise the blindingly obvious fact that transmission is happening in schools and that this can spread to families. But the government now needs to act. ""Much more is needed to control the virus in schools and to protect communities."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was ""vital"" children remained in school until the end of term Parents outside Robert Owen Nursery School and Christ Church Church of England Primary School, both in Greenwich, reacted to the news schools in the borough would be closing early. One mother said: ""I really feel for the kids. ""After a pretty up and down year, a year that hasn't been the best, it would be nice to end the year with a couple of parties but I completely understand and I think the nursery does a great job."" Many questioned the timing. One mother said: ""It's 2.5 days, so I don't see what difference this is really going to make and I think the timing of it is really, really bad. ""I'm on maternity at the moment but if I was working, it's just too short notice to get any kind of childcare arrangements in place."" One father added: ""I think the timing might be right as a lot of people will be gathering for Christmas and it takes 10 to 14 days to show up so it may be damage limitation. ""I hope it will have an impact. If not, then it's just political."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used,"The gowns ordered from PPE Medpro were similar to that pictured here Millions of medical gowns bought for the NHS at the end of the first lockdown for Â£122m have never been used. The gowns were ordered by the government from a supplier which had set up just a month earlier, and no other companies were asked to bid for the contract. The supplier, PPE Medpro, says it had met the agreed terms. The Department of Health said all PPE must undergo rigorous checks. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks Does the NHS have enough protective gear for winter? PPE Medpro was set up as a company in May while the UK was still in the first coronavirus lockdown. At the time, hospitals across the country were reporting shortages of personal protective equipment - clothing and accessories to protect medics from the virus. Earlier this week NHS Providers, which represents English hospital trusts, told the House of Commons spending watchdog that the supply of gowns was the most ""pertinent problem"" over several months. Six weeks after it was incorporated, PPE Medpro signed a contract with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for Â£122m to supply sterile surgical gowns to the NHS in England. The contract was not opened to competition due to the exceptional urgency of the coronavirus pandemic. Sterile surgical gowns are used to reduce the risk of infection when Covid patients are put on to ventilators, for example. The DHSC told the BBC that contracts for the gowns must meet the British Standard for the sterilisation of medical devices or a ""technical equivalent"". PPE Medpro followed this second route. This required the DHSC to seek approval from the health regulator, the MHRA, for them to be used in the NHS. The contract, which shows the agreed sum of Â£122m The DHSC and MHRA declined to comment when asked for details of the approval application made for the Medpro products. There is as yet no record of PPE Medpro or either of its two Chinese suppliers on the regulator's exemptions list, although it is understood the evaluation process is now under way. PPE Medpro say they delivered 100 per cent of the contract to the terms specified. The company said it supplied the equipment ""fully in accordance with the agreed contract, which included clear terms as to technical specification and performance criteria of the products"". ""We did so in very challenging circumstances earlier this year and are very pleased to have been able to assist DHSC fully and properly at a time of national crisis,"" it added. In August the BBC revealed that 50 million face masks bought by the UK government from a different company earlier in the year would not be used in the NHS because of safety concerns. The DHSC said: ""The safety of front-line staff and patients is of paramount importance and we now have a four-month stockpile of all Covid-critical PPE in place. ""All PPE must undergo rigorous checks so they meet the safety and quality required. ""Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts and we take these checks extremely seriously.""

Second Welsh health board stops non-urgent careThe health board is the second in Wales to cancel outpatient appointments and non-urgent surgery.WalesComments,"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"". But Mr Gething fears people would ""make up their own rules"" if meeting up over Christmas was banned. Wales has thehighest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK- a seven-day average of 425 cases per 100,000 - and eight of the UK's top 10 worst infected areas are in Wales with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend the top three. In a letter to the health minister, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman Dr Richard Pugh warns critical care services will not be able to cope over the winter period without intervention ""at the highest level"". Christmas five-day relaxation period 'a mistake' How do Wales Covid cases compare to other nations? Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients Up to three households can stay together and form a""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, all four UK nations have agreed. But the body representing intensive care staff want that decision reviewed amid fears it will cause a surge in cases. ""Christmas is a special time but it seems a very, very difficult thing to justify,"" said Dr Pugh. ""It makes no sense viewed from a perspective of front-line staff and public health."" With 190 critical care beds already being used - almost half by coronavirus patients - Dr Pugh said critical care was already over-capacity. ""Welsh critical care services will be unable to manage rising demands relating to Covid-19, to maintain emergency non-Covid activity, and to continue providing peri-operative care for high risk urgent surgical cases in coming weeks without intervention at the highest level,"" he said. Two health boards in south Wales have already cancelled some non-urgent care - Swansea Bay andAneurin Bevan University Health Boards. This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Ambulances waited for the equivalent of a week to deliver sick patients to hospital staff at the new Â£350m Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran on Saturday. On Sunday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board apologised after a73-year-old man waited more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside that hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service said more than 10 patients had waited more than 12 hours in ambulances outside hospitals awaiting beds in the last week. The family of Ted Edwards from Monmouthshire said he waited for 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital The service has raised its alert system to its highest level, which signals ""extreme pressure"". ""We've seen more Covid-related patients in the last six weeks than than we've seen since March,"" chief executive Jason Killenstold BBC Radio Wales. ""We've more staff off sick or self-isolating since April and we've seen some of our busiest days this year in the last 10 days, with four of the last five days the busiest since the start of the pandemic."" Added to ""congestion"" outside hospital A&E departments, Mr Killen apologised as ambulance crews had ""real difficulties being able to respond in a timely way, particularly to less serious patients"". Dr Pugh said there was now a case for the cancellation of elective surgery to happen on a ""national basis"" to allow the NHS to be able to treat new patients as coronavirus cases increased. He said that while imposing more stringent rules ahead of the festive period was difficult, the impact of lockdowns took weeks to help departments. ""Viewed from a front-line perspective, I am afraid we do not have the luxury of deferring such steps until after the Christmas period,"" added the intensive care consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire. Morriston Hospital will be one of those in Swansea only treating urgent cases Mr Gething said the situation across Wales was ""very serious"" but added it was not Wales' ""preference"" to break the Christmas rule relaxation. ""There is a lot of capital invested in that easing of the rules which all four countries signed up to,"" he said. Mr Gething said officials were now working with hospitals to look at how to send patients who were no longer infectious - especially the elderly - home. The seven-day case rate for Swansea Bay Health Board area, which treats patients in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea, now stands at 770.3 per 100,000 people. It has the second highest rate for any of the board areas in Wales, behind Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board on 870.3. There were also more than 250 Covid patients in Swansea Bay hospitals, with another 115 recovering patients. This is about a third of all patients. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned the Welsh NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"" whenthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Waleson Saturday. Mr Gething said the Welsh NHS had experienced one of its busiest weekends of 2020 as it dealt with a combination of rising Covid cases and winter pressures. He urged people to abide by rules and regulations, adding: ""We need everyone's help to get through what remains of this year."" Covid-19 patients make up nearly 26% of all patients in hospital with 1,992 people in hospital across Wales on Sunday. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant at the new Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, warned the hospital was ""stuffed full with patients with very significant needs"". ""We have reached a tipping point, we have more patients that have Covid than don't have Covid now,"" she said. Dr Sarah Aitken, the health board's interim executive medical director, said there were now 404 patients with confirmed coronavirus in its hospitals - compared to 283 in April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

"Trump rejects early White House vaccinationsThe US president asks for an ""adjustment"" to plans to vaccinate senior officials in the coming days.US & Canada","This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US President Donald Trump says he has reversed a plan for White House officials to receive a coronavirus vaccine in the coming days. Officials said senior members of the Trump administration would be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. But Mr Trump later tweeted that people working at the White House ""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". The US will begin its roll out of the vaccine on Monday. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to dozens of locations in all 50 states across the US. The first shipment of those doses left a facility in Michigan on Sunday, with health workers and the elderly in line to receive the first shots. Can people with allergies have the Covid vaccine? US faces bleak winter amid worst virus wave yet Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US News on Sunday that White House staff would be among the first to be vaccinated drew criticism on social media. It was not clear why Mr Trump decided to change the plans, or what effect it would have on the government's efforts to protect top officials. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US, with a world-record daily increase of 3,309 reported on Saturday. The vaccine's rollout has been framed as a turning point in the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken the lives of almost 300,000 people in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its emergency-use authorisation of the vaccine, announced on Friday, was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, after it came under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the jab. Doses of the same vaccine are already being administered in the UK. The Pfizer vaccine has received regulatory approval in Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well. The beginning of the vaccination drive in the US comes as the Electoral College - the system which elects US presidents - isset to endorse Joe Biden's victory on Monday. Officials told several media outlets on Sunday that some of the first vaccines would be reserved for those who work in close proximity to Mr Trump. The vaccination plan, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Ullyot. One aim of the programme was to build public confidence in the vaccine, he said. ""The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership,"" Mr Ullyot said. But Mr Trump on Sunday suggested that top officials would now have to wait longer. ""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,"" he said in a tweet.,external""I have asked that this adjustment be made."" The US president, who contracted coronavirus in October and recovered after treatment in hospital, said he was not yet scheduled to take the vaccine but looked forward to doing so ""at the appropriate time"". He has previously claimed to be ""immune"", even though medical experts say it is unclear whether people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second infection, and if so, how long this protection might last. Boxes containing Pfizer's vaccine are being shipped across the US There have been a number of coronavirus outbreaks in the White House, with several senior staffers and officials testing positive for the disease. The latest is Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who revealed last week thathe was being treated with the same drug cocktail as the president. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. This video can not be played The BBC's Karishma Vaswani is shown around a cold storage facility in Singapore The vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures, which makes distribution difficult. Special shipping containers that use dry ice will be used to transport frozen vials direct to the point of vaccination, Pfizer says. The pharmaceutical company has agreed a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses of the vaccine by March. An additional 200 million doses of a second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, will be provided by June. However this vaccine is still seeking approval in the US.

GPs in England to begin offering Covid vaccineSurgeries in more than 100 locations are receiving their first deliveries of the Pfizer jab.Health,"Covid vaccinations will start being given to patients from GP surgeries in England as part of the next stage of the rollout of the programme. GP practices in more than 100 locations will receive their first deliveries of the vaccine later, the NHS said. Some will start vaccinating on Monday afternoon, with the majority getting under way on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people in the UKreceived the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last week in hospitals. Like last week, GP practices will prioritise over-80s, along with health and care staff. Dr Simon Hodes, a GP from Watford who will begin vaccinations on Monday, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme patients are welcoming their jab offers with ""great excitement"". He said calls to at-risk over-80s showed very few of his patients had worries about the vaccine. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? ""They've been reading the news - they know it's safe - and they're keen to have it,"" he said. He added that his surgery has a ""military[-style] operation"" to ensure doses of the vaccine are not wasted - with a list of health workers drawn up if doses are going spare. Dr Nikita Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, urged people waiting for coronavirus vaccinations to be patient. ""There's a huge range of things that general practices are already doing so if we can ask for people to just wait a moment and wait to be contacted that would be very appreciated,"" she told Today. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast arrangements were in place ""to make sure the distribution of vaccines is not in any way disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He added that there would be ""some millions"" of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK before Christmas. ""We are going as fast as we can in terms of the vaccination programme,"" he said. Once the vaccine is delivered, there will be no messing around. GP practices will receive batches containing 975 doses. These will have been thawed out - they are kept in ultra-cold storage in hospital - which means practices only have three-and-a-half days to use them up. It will be all hands on deck therefore with GPs, practice nurses and health care assistants working together to vaccinate the over-80s. The 100 or so practices getting the vaccine on Monday will be followed by another 100 to 200 over the course of the week. The rest of the network of 1,200 designated practices - each local area has been asked to nominate one practice to deliver the vaccine - are expected to follow in the coming weeks. But that will depend on supply. There's thought to be fewer than one million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the country - although more is due to arrive from Belgium soon. What could change the whole speed of rollout is approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Regulators are currently assessing the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine, of which there are already over five million doses available. Care home residents in England are also expected to receive their first vaccine later this week, along with other parts of the UK, the NHS said. Roll-out to care homes - the highest priority for vaccination - had been held up by strict rules governing the handling of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -70C. But the regulator is expected to give the green light to vaccinators taking the jab into care homes in the coming days. In Scotland, family doctors are helping deliver the vaccination programme via hospital hubs but England is the first part of the UK to roll out the jab through GP practices. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, acknowledged there were ""logistical challenges"" to the rollout but said GPs had ""an excellent track record of delivering mass vaccination programmes"". He added: ""We won't be vaccinating everyone all at once - it will be a relatively small number at first - but as long as there is supply, GPs and our teams at selected sites will start vaccinating people this week, starting with our most vulnerable patients."" He urged people not to contact their GP enquiring about vaccination, saying patients would be contacted when it was their turn to get the jab. It comes as a further 18,447 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Recorded deaths tend to be lower over the weekend due to reporting delays. Ministers and experts have warned the rollout of the vaccine does not mean coronavirus restrictions can be suddenly relaxed. On Sunday NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England -said people must think carefully about the risk of increased social contact over Christmas, despite the rules allowing three households to mix indoors and stay overnight between 23 and 27 December. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? From this week mass testingis being rolled out in 67 areas of England which are under tier three restrictions, including Oldham, Lancashire and Kent. Mass testingis also being offered to sixth-form and secondary school staff, pupils and their familiesin parts of north-east London, Essex and Kent, following a rise in cases, particularly among 11 to 18-year-olds.

Hospital 'stuffed full' with Covid patients,"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"". But Mr Gething fears people would ""make up their own rules"" if meeting up over Christmas was banned. Wales has thehighest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK- a seven-day average of 425 cases per 100,000 - and eight of the UK's top 10 worst infected areas are in Wales with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend the top three. In a letter to the health minister, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman Dr Richard Pugh warns critical care services will not be able to cope over the winter period without intervention ""at the highest level"". Christmas five-day relaxation period 'a mistake' How do Wales Covid cases compare to other nations? Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients Up to three households can stay together and form a""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, all four UK nations have agreed. But the body representing intensive care staff want that decision reviewed amid fears it will cause a surge in cases. ""Christmas is a special time but it seems a very, very difficult thing to justify,"" said Dr Pugh. ""It makes no sense viewed from a perspective of front-line staff and public health."" With 190 critical care beds already being used - almost half by coronavirus patients - Dr Pugh said critical care was already over-capacity. ""Welsh critical care services will be unable to manage rising demands relating to Covid-19, to maintain emergency non-Covid activity, and to continue providing peri-operative care for high risk urgent surgical cases in coming weeks without intervention at the highest level,"" he said. Two health boards in south Wales have already cancelled some non-urgent care - Swansea Bay andAneurin Bevan University Health Boards. This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Ambulances waited for the equivalent of a week to deliver sick patients to hospital staff at the new Â£350m Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran on Saturday. On Sunday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board apologised after a73-year-old man waited more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside that hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service said more than 10 patients had waited more than 12 hours in ambulances outside hospitals awaiting beds in the last week. The family of Ted Edwards from Monmouthshire said he waited for 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital The service has raised its alert system to its highest level, which signals ""extreme pressure"". ""We've seen more Covid-related patients in the last six weeks than than we've seen since March,"" chief executive Jason Killenstold BBC Radio Wales. ""We've more staff off sick or self-isolating since April and we've seen some of our busiest days this year in the last 10 days, with four of the last five days the busiest since the start of the pandemic."" Added to ""congestion"" outside hospital A&E departments, Mr Killen apologised as ambulance crews had ""real difficulties being able to respond in a timely way, particularly to less serious patients"". Dr Pugh said there was now a case for the cancellation of elective surgery to happen on a ""national basis"" to allow the NHS to be able to treat new patients as coronavirus cases increased. He said that while imposing more stringent rules ahead of the festive period was difficult, the impact of lockdowns took weeks to help departments. ""Viewed from a front-line perspective, I am afraid we do not have the luxury of deferring such steps until after the Christmas period,"" added the intensive care consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire. Morriston Hospital will be one of those in Swansea only treating urgent cases Mr Gething said the situation across Wales was ""very serious"" but added it was not Wales' ""preference"" to break the Christmas rule relaxation. ""There is a lot of capital invested in that easing of the rules which all four countries signed up to,"" he said. Mr Gething said officials were now working with hospitals to look at how to send patients who were no longer infectious - especially the elderly - home. The seven-day case rate for Swansea Bay Health Board area, which treats patients in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea, now stands at 770.3 per 100,000 people. It has the second highest rate for any of the board areas in Wales, behind Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board on 870.3. There were also more than 250 Covid patients in Swansea Bay hospitals, with another 115 recovering patients. This is about a third of all patients. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned the Welsh NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"" whenthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Waleson Saturday. Mr Gething said the Welsh NHS had experienced one of its busiest weekends of 2020 as it dealt with a combination of rising Covid cases and winter pressures. He urged people to abide by rules and regulations, adding: ""We need everyone's help to get through what remains of this year."" Covid-19 patients make up nearly 26% of all patients in hospital with 1,992 people in hospital across Wales on Sunday. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant at the new Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, warned the hospital was ""stuffed full with patients with very significant needs"". ""We have reached a tipping point, we have more patients that have Covid than don't have Covid now,"" she said. Dr Sarah Aitken, the health board's interim executive medical director, said there were now 404 patients with confirmed coronavirus in its hospitals - compared to 283 in April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

Brexit trade talks to enter 'extra mile',"Michel Barnier is leading the EU's negotiating team in Monday's talks UK and EU negotiators have restarted talks over a post-Brexit trade deal in hope of securing an agreement. It comes after the two sides confirmed on Sunday there had been enough progress for negotiations to continue. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday there had been ""movement"" in the talks and negotiators had not exhausted all options. But a UK government source later said there had not been ""significant progress in recent days"". Time is fast running out to finalise an agreement before the UK's Brexit transition ends in just over two weeks. The decision to keep talking came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the main sticking points with President Von der Leyen on Sunday. Negotiations will continue in Brussels on Tuesday, but a new deadline for a decision has not been set. The ultimate deadline comes on 31 December, however, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? Pound gains after EU trade talks extended Without a trade deal in place by then, the two sides would begin trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, meaning taxes - or tariffs - would be introduced, potentially raising the cost of imported goods such as food. Fishing rights, ""level playing field"" rules on how far the UK should be able to diverge from EU laws, and how any agreement should be policed remain the major stumbling blocks. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has resumed talks with his UK counterpart Lord Frost, after briefing ambassadors of EU member states. According to an EU source, Mr Barnier is believed to have told them talks over a level playing field remained hard, but were moving towards an agreement. He is also said to have told them a wider deal could fall into place if a route towards an agreement on fishing rights can be identified. But a UK government source later downplayed progress, saying: ""Talks remain difficult and we have not made significant progress in recent days, despite efforts by the UK side to bring energy and ideas to the process."" Lord Frost has said a deal is only possible if it ""fully respects UK sovereignty"". Speaking at an event on Monday, Mrs von der Leyen said the issue of the level playing field was the ""one and only important question"" if UK should continue to have access to the EU's single market. The EU Commission president added: ""They have either to play by our rules, because this is a matter of fairness for our companies... or the other choice is there is a price on it, and the price is border and tariffs."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the continuation of the talks and said the worst outcome would be to ""crash out with no deal whatsoever on 1 January"". This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We want a level playing field not only at the start, but also over time"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? This new phase of the talks is expected to focus on how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. The EU is reported to have dropped the idea of a formal mechanism to ensure both sides keep up with each other's standards and is now prepared to accept UK divergence - provided there are safeguards to prevent unfair competition. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. What does it mean in Brexit trade deal terms ""to go the extra mile""? That's the distance the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, have promised to travel over the next days. But will the road take them to deal or no-deal? And who will compromise on what to get there? EU contacts close to the talks say both sides are being constructive. They insist negotiations aren't simply continuing because neither the EU, nor the government want to be blamed in a no-deal scenario and prefer not to walk away first. Remember: what's said in front of the cameras is only part of the picture. We aren't behind the scenes in the negotiating room or on the closed calls between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen. But however long these talks rumble on, ultimately neither the government, nor the EU, will sign up to a deal if they can't claim it as a victory. Read more from Katya here. The National Farmers' Union has warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. And the British Retail Consortium warned the public would face ""over Â£3bn in food tariffs [meaning] retailers would have no choice but to pass on some of these additional costs to their customers"".

Celebrated spy author John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89,"British espionage writer John le CarrÃ© has died aged 89, following a short illness, his literary agent has said. The author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy died from pneumonia on Saturday. Fellow authors paid tribute, with Stephen King calling him ""a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit"". Historical fiction writer Robert Harris said le CarrÃ©, who chronicled the world of Cold War spies, was ""one of the great post-war British novelists"". Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood tweeted that his novels featuring spymaster George Smiley - described by le CarrÃ© as an ""antidote"" to James Bond - were the ""key to understanding the mid-20th Century"". Historian and novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore described le CarrÃ© as ""the titan of English literature"" and said he was ""heartbroken"". Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' author Obituary: The spy who turned into a novelist John le CarrÃ© on why 'politicians love chaos' Jonny Geller, the author's agent, said he was an ""undisputed giant of English literature"" who ""defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power"". ""We will not see his like again,"" he said in a statement. Mr Geller said he represented the novelist, whose real name was David Cornwell, for almost 15 years and ""his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition"". ""We have lost a great figure of English literature, a man of great wit, kindness, humour and intelligence. I have lost a friend, a mentor and an inspiration."" Le CarrÃ©'s novels drew on his experience working for the British intelligence services The Night Manager was a major BBC series A statement shared on behalf of the author's family said: ""It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell - John le CarrÃ© - passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness. ""David is survived by his beloved wife of almost 50 years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. ""We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness."" The statement said his death was not Covid-19 related. The decades after the end of World War Two in 1945 were dominated by political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Both sides were armed with nuclear weapons, discouraging direct warfare because of the risk that both would be totally destroyed. So until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the hostility played out in support for regional conflicts known as proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, psychological warfare and espionage - creating the inspiration for a generation of spy novels and films. Several of le CarrÃ©'s 25 works were turned into films including The Constant Gardener, The Tailor of Panama and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, while the Night Manager became a successfulBBC television series. Smiley, his most famous character who first appeared in Call for the Dead, has been played by actors including Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. Oldman, who appeared in the 2011 film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, said le CarrÃ© was ""a very great author, the true 'owner' of the serious, adult, complicated, spy novel"" and was ""always a true gentleman"". This video can not be played In an interview last year, John le CarrÃ© talked about the conflict between personal and state obligation Born as David Cornwell in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, he wrote under the pseudonym of John le CarrÃ©. He studied at the university of Bern, in Switzerland, and then Oxford, before entering a career in undercover intelligence. After teaching at Eton for two years he joined the Foreign Office, and was initially based at the British Embassy in Bonn. During his time there he worked in the intelligence records department, giving him access to files with insights into the workings of the secret service. He also wrote his first novel, Call For The Dead, which was published in 1961. This meant the need for a pen name as Foreign Office officials were not allowed to publish books under their own name. In 1963, his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. Le CarrÃ© said his manuscript was approved by the secret service because they ""rightly if reluctantly"" concluded it was ""sheer fiction from start to finish"" but he said the world's press took a different view, deciding the book was ""not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side"". His career as a spy came to an end in 1964 after his name was one of many given to the Soviet Union by a double agent, an incident which inspired a plot line in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Two things stand out about this prolific and hugely successful author. Firstly, his novels were the very antithesis of the glamorous, racy world of James Bond as depicted by fellow author Ian Fleming. Whether it was the grim reality of waiting hours for an agent to cross back into West Berlin in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or the drab, grey world of Cold War MI6 that he describes in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, le CarrÃ© stripped away the glitz to reveal a world of fallible, flawed characters. Secondly, there is his extraordinary longevity. Le CarrÃ©, who spent a relatively brief period with MI6, published his first novel in the same year that the Berlin Wall went up: 1961. Yet long after the Cold War ended, decades later, he went on to diversify into writing about the arms trade, Big Pharma and the so-called War on Terror. On the few occasions I met him he seemed genuinely surprised at his own extraordinary success. Le CarrÃ© turned down literary honours and a knighthood, saying in a 2017 US interview that he was ""so suspicious of the literary world that I don't want its accolades"". ""And least of all do I want to be called Commander of the British Empire or any other thing of the British Empire,"" he added, saying it was ""emetic"" or vomit-inducing. He told CBS News' 60 Minutes: ""I don't want to posture as someone who's been honoured by the state and must therefore somehow conform with the state, and I don't want to wear the armour."" Le CarrÃ© described himself as ""English to the core"" but deplored what he saw as the aggressive nationalistic sentiment behind Brexit. ""My England would be the one that recognises its place in the EU. The jingoistic England that is trying to march us out of the EU, that is an England I don't want to know,"" he said.

"Brexit trade talks to enter 'extra mile'A deadline to finish negotiations had been set for Sunday, but the UK and EU agreed to keep talking.","Michel Barnier is leading the EU's negotiating team in Monday's talks UK and EU negotiators have restarted talks over a post-Brexit trade deal in hope of securing an agreement. It comes after the two sides confirmed on Sunday there had been enough progress for negotiations to continue. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday there had been ""movement"" in the talks and negotiators had not exhausted all options. But a UK government source later said there had not been ""significant progress in recent days"". Time is fast running out to finalise an agreement before the UK's Brexit transition ends in just over two weeks. The decision to keep talking came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the main sticking points with President Von der Leyen on Sunday. Negotiations will continue in Brussels on Tuesday, but a new deadline for a decision has not been set. The ultimate deadline comes on 31 December, however, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? Pound gains after EU trade talks extended Without a trade deal in place by then, the two sides would begin trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, meaning taxes - or tariffs - would be introduced, potentially raising the cost of imported goods such as food. Fishing rights, ""level playing field"" rules on how far the UK should be able to diverge from EU laws, and how any agreement should be policed remain the major stumbling blocks. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has resumed talks with his UK counterpart Lord Frost, after briefing ambassadors of EU member states. According to an EU source, Mr Barnier is believed to have told them talks over a level playing field remained hard, but were moving towards an agreement. He is also said to have told them a wider deal could fall into place if a route towards an agreement on fishing rights can be identified. But a UK government source later downplayed progress, saying: ""Talks remain difficult and we have not made significant progress in recent days, despite efforts by the UK side to bring energy and ideas to the process."" Lord Frost has said a deal is only possible if it ""fully respects UK sovereignty"". Speaking at an event on Monday, Mrs von der Leyen said the issue of the level playing field was the ""one and only important question"" if UK should continue to have access to the EU's single market. The EU Commission president added: ""They have either to play by our rules, because this is a matter of fairness for our companies... or the other choice is there is a price on it, and the price is border and tariffs."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the continuation of the talks and said the worst outcome would be to ""crash out with no deal whatsoever on 1 January"". This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We want a level playing field not only at the start, but also over time"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? This new phase of the talks is expected to focus on how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. The EU is reported to have dropped the idea of a formal mechanism to ensure both sides keep up with each other's standards and is now prepared to accept UK divergence - provided there are safeguards to prevent unfair competition. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. What does it mean in Brexit trade deal terms ""to go the extra mile""? That's the distance the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, have promised to travel over the next days. But will the road take them to deal or no-deal? And who will compromise on what to get there? EU contacts close to the talks say both sides are being constructive. They insist negotiations aren't simply continuing because neither the EU, nor the government want to be blamed in a no-deal scenario and prefer not to walk away first. Remember: what's said in front of the cameras is only part of the picture. We aren't behind the scenes in the negotiating room or on the closed calls between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen.

"Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid testsFrom January, close contacts of people with coronavirus cases can get daily tests for 10 days.","Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges in Wales from January Coronavirus testing is to be rolled out in schools and colleges from January. Pupils and staff identified as close contacts will be offered alateral flow testeach day of a self-isolation period, the Welsh Government said. Those who test negative can continue going to school or college, while those who test positive would self-isolate and book a confirmatory test. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said training for school staff would begin this week and continue in January. He added that testing would not be compulsory. But Laura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said the plan to roll it out next term was ""laughable"". She said: ""The implications for schools to mass test on a national scale is huge. ""For the health minister to say it can be rolled out at the start of next term when the teachers have to carry out the tests and they haven't been trained is laughable."" She added: ""Ministers have an awful lot of work to do to repair the damage that has been done to their relationship with the teaching profession."" Currently, pupils and staff identified as close contacts from a positive test must self-isolate for 10 days. However, under the new plans they would be asked to either self-isolate as normal or take a lateral flow test at the start of the school day for the duration of their self-isolation period. Schools and colleges will be offered support, equipment and training, and all special school staff will be offered weekly testing. Eithe Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders in Wales, toldBBC Radio Walesthe plan had advantages in reducing the number of people isolating and easing concerns, but she also had questions over how it would work. NHS rapid test use defended amid accuracy concerns Mass testing in Wales' schools considered Wales' secondary school system 'must reinvent itself' Ms Hughes said: ""Then I'd be wondering about why I'm hearing about policy on the media in the last week of term when there's already so much else to be done. ""Then there are some questions around the logistics of actually carrying out this mass testing in essence... if it's a large secondary school and you've got multiple year groups involved, what does that look like for a school every morning for 10 days? ""Then again, if there is a positive, and additional contacts considered, does that mean the process starts again for another 10 days?"" Ms Hughes also questioned how school staff would have time to administer or oversee testing and how schools would find space. She said: ""Where are the teachers and staff who are actually able to have space to oversee this? Teachers at the minute are very thin on the ground and supply staff are very difficult to find. ""Where does the time come from in a working day? ""The principle is laudable and I don't think anybody would say the principle isn't correct, but rolling this out in a school setting could present significant difficulties."" Jackie Parker, head teacher at Crickhowell High School in Powys, said she welcomed the scheme but further details were needed. ""We want to have the minimum disruption we can to have the tests offer some security for families and teachers,"" she said. ""The devil is in the detail... it's working out how we can do this when it's going to be, as far as I know, staff in school doing this [the tests] and obviously there's training, protocol, informing parents of exactly what's happening so we're going to need all the detail and time to prepare. ""Schools have worked miracles over the last few months, as have other key workers, and we will do our very best to facilitate this but I've got 967 students in the school, so a year group bubble may be 150 so it's working out the careful logistics of this."" Ms Parker called for teachers to be vaccinated as key workers so they would not need to undergo testing. ""We would be able to carry on and we want to minimise any disruption in the learning of young people."" Lateral flow Covid-19 tests provide a result in 20-30 minutes Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the rollout has been confirmed following talks with Public Health Wales and the children and schools Technical Advisory Cell. She said the plans would ""play an integral role... to deliver maximum learning with as minimal disruption as possible"". ""We recognise that it has not been easy for pupils and staff who have been required to self-isolate as a result of having been identified as a close contact and we recognise the impact it has had on face-to-face teaching."" Julia James, from Porthcawl, said she was supportive of the plans and would want her daughter, who is currently self-isolating, to receive tests. ""There's no consistency between various schools, some have been hit harder, so it's been quite unfair when it comes to predicting grades,"" she said. ""These tests are only going to help that. ""I don't understand anyone who would not be for it, as long as the teachers are happy as it's going over and above their job description."" Lateral flow testing detects the presence of the Covid-19 viral antigen from a swab sample and produce results within 20 to 30 minutes. Earlier this month,a senior NHS adviser defended the mass use of these testsfollowing concerns about their accuracy. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, accepted there had been ""false negatives"" but stressed the policy was a ""game-changer"". A study found the tests missed 50% of cases and some scientists fear people could start to ignore health advice. Testing is planned to be introduced to all schools and further education settings, including primary and childcare staff, the Welsh Government said, but will be phased on levels of risk, starting with secondary schools and further education institutions. Mr Gething said testing by itself ""cannot eradicate the risks associated with contracting and transmitting Covid-19"". ""Testing... needs to be taken alongside other infection prevention control measures, including appropriate social distancing and hand hygiene measures."" He said mass testing in parts of Wales would ""help inform how we can successfully deliver lateral flow testing in schools and other education settings in the future"".

Ministers and officials are said to be ""deeply concerned"" about a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases across the capital. BBC health editor Hugh Pym reports London MPs have been briefed on the data, but no decision has been taken. London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged ministers to act ""with open eyes"" and avoid damaging the capital's economy. He said tier three could have a ""catastrophic consequence"" for hospitality, culture and some retail, as pubs and restaurants would be limited to takeaways or deliveries. Council leaders in London are understood to be alarmed at the projected rise in cases and some are pushing for a ""tier three plus"" regime with tougher restrictions than tier three on its own. Essex may also be moved from tier two to tier three, which would see hotels largely closed, sports fans excluded from events, and residents advised against travelling to other areas. London mayor calls for schools to close early What are the rules if my area moves to tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live With Kent, Medway and Slough already under tier three rules, large parts of south-east England could soon join much of the Midlands, North West and North East under the strictest curbs on social contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons at 15:30 GMT and later lead a Downing Street news conference. He is also due to speak to London MPs shortly before he appears in the Commons, Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said. You cannot mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except with your household or bubble You can meet in a group of up to six in other outdoor spaces, such as parks, beaches or countryside Shops, gyms and personal care services (such as hairdressing) can stay open Bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway Sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums Indoor entertainment venues - such as bowling alleys and cinemas - must stay closed People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas Read more about the tier three rules Some areas in and around London have recorded large increases in confirmed coronavirus cases over the past week. In the week to 12 November, Havering was the only area of London in the top 100 places in England with the highest infection rates, at 85th. It now has the fifth highest rate, at 506 cases per 100,000, BBC England data unit's Rob England said. Back in November, London had the third lowest regional rate of about 187 cases per 100,000, while Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest at 443 per 100,000. Now the two regions seem to have swapped places, with Yorkshire enjoying the third lowest rate of about 170 per 100,000. Hugh Pym described the situation as ""fast-moving"" and that he understood health officials presented data showing a sharp rise in virus cases - risking further rapid increases in the coming days. The east of London and the bits of Essex and Kent that border it have now become the hotspots for Covid. Cases are rising and there are several east London boroughs that have seen more than 350 cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, Manchester which is in tier three, has seen 176 cases per 100,000 in the past seven days. What has provided some protection for London is the fact hospitals have not been at immediate risk of being overwhelmed. Latest data from London from a week ago showed one in nine beds were available. But admissions have continued to go up since - causing real concern behind the scenes. Other parts of the capital have lower rates, but there are signs they are rising too. That's why the government feels it has little option but to act. Experts warned last week that London should be placed in tier threeimmediately to avoid an increase in coronavirus deaths. But at the time the Department of Health said a review of tiers would happen every 14 days, with the next due on 16 December. Meanwhile, London's mayor has urged the government to ask all secondary schools and colleges in the capital to close early ahead of Christmas. Sadiq Khan said he also wanted an extended break for schools as there are ""significant"" Covid outbreaks among 10 to 19-year-olds. Islington Council has followed Greenwich in advising schools to switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Downing Street said it expects all schools and colleges in England to remain open until the end of term on Thursday. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Despite coronavirus cases continuing to rise, No 10 said the government ""has no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which effectively suspend the tier system of restrictions and allow more households to mix. It came as people in Scotlandwere told to ""cut down"" the number of contacts in the week before Christmasif they plan to meet up with relatives. In Wales, a second health boardhas suspended non-urgent care amid a continued rise in cases. And a leading doctor in Northern Irelandsaid its health service is facing a ""nightmare"" scenarioin January. Elsewhere, Covid vaccinations have started being given to patients at GP surgeries in Englandas part of the next stage of the rollout of the vaccine programme. Overall on Sunday, confirmed cases rose by 19% across the UK compared with the previous seven days, with 18,447 reported. A further 144 deaths were also recorded.

Adler: Tentative progress made,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' What does it mean in Brexit trade deal terms ""to go the extra mile""? That's the distance the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, have promised to travel over the next days. But will the road take them to deal or no-deal? And who will compromise on what to get there? EU contacts close to the talks say both sides are being constructive. They insist negotiations aren't simply continuing because neither the EU, nor the government want to be blamed in a no-deal scenario and prefer not to walk away first. ""We're carrying on talking because no-deal is a big deal,"" one EU contact told me. ""We think it will have a dramatic impact on lives and livelihoods. As long as talks aren't going backwards, it would be irresponsible not to give this a chance."" Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"" The now-infamous three main sticking points are still open, with tentative progress being made, we hear. We understand: 1)On fishing rights, EU whispers suggest a kick-the-can, down-the-road fudged compromise might be found (though not settled yet), involving considerable European concessions 2)The governance of the overall deal is being worked on in detail. Still to be agreed: what actions could be slapped with which sanctions, and who decides 3)Competition regulations - aka the level playing field - are still a big issue Alongside technical talks, both sides say political intervention will certainly still be needed. So, what are we to make of the prime minister sounding a whole lot gloomier on Sunday about the prospects of a deal, than the European Commission, carrying out the negotiations on the EU's behalf? UK and EU to 'go the extra mile' in Brexit talks What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Remember: what's said in front of the cameras is only part of the picture. We aren't behind the scenes in the negotiating room or on the closed calls between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen. But however long these talks rumble on, ultimately neither the government, nor the EU, will sign up to a deal if they can't claim it as a victory. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are continuing:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? For Mr Johnson, that means being able to say the deal respects post-Brexit national sovereignty; that it allows the UK to make and take its own decisions. Brussels wants to be able to confidently reassure the 27 EU leaders that the deal protects the single market and European businesses in it from what they feared could be unfair UK competition. If there is a deal, the EU assumption is that many in the UK will want to trumpet what one Brussels insider called ""a Great British Victory"" and to point to EU concessions, real or alleged. ""If that narrative helps get a deal over the line in the UK, then it's worth it,"" he shrugged. ""Few Europeans are paying attention to the Brexit process anymore. We don't care about PR. We care about protecting our interests, deal or no-deal."" That last sentiment, of course, is one loudly expressed by the UK too. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Celebrated spy author John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89The renowned Cold War novelist, author of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, died following a short illness.Entertainment & Arts","British espionage writer John le CarrÃ© has died aged 89, following a short illness, his literary agent has said. The author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy died from pneumonia on Saturday. Fellow authors paid tribute, with Stephen King calling him ""a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit"". Historical fiction writer Robert Harris said le CarrÃ©, who chronicled the world of Cold War spies, was ""one of the great post-war British novelists"". Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood tweeted that his novels featuring spymaster George Smiley - described by le CarrÃ© as an ""antidote"" to James Bond - were the ""key to understanding the mid-20th Century"". Historian and novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore described le CarrÃ© as ""the titan of English literature"" and said he was ""heartbroken"". Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' author Obituary: The spy who turned into a novelist John le CarrÃ© on why 'politicians love chaos' Jonny Geller, the author's agent, said he was an ""undisputed giant of English literature"" who ""defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power"". ""We will not see his like again,"" he said in a statement. Mr Geller said he represented the novelist, whose real name was David Cornwell, for almost 15 years and ""his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition"". ""We have lost a great figure of English literature, a man of great wit, kindness, humour and intelligence. I have lost a friend, a mentor and an inspiration."" Le CarrÃ©'s novels drew on his experience working for the British intelligence services The Night Manager was a major BBC series A statement shared on behalf of the author's family said: ""It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell - John le CarrÃ© - passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness. ""David is survived by his beloved wife of almost 50 years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. ""We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness."" The statement said his death was not Covid-19 related. The decades after the end of World War Two in 1945 were dominated by political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Both sides were armed with nuclear weapons, discouraging direct warfare because of the risk that both would be totally destroyed. So until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the hostility played out in support for regional conflicts known as proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, psychological warfare and espionage - creating the inspiration for a generation of spy novels and films. Several of le CarrÃ©'s 25 works were turned into films including The Constant Gardener, The Tailor of Panama and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, while the Night Manager became a successfulBBC television series. Smiley, his most famous character who first appeared in Call for the Dead, has been played by actors including Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. Oldman, who appeared in the 2011 film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, said le CarrÃ© was ""a very great author, the true 'owner' of the serious, adult, complicated, spy novel"" and was ""always a true gentleman"". This video can not be played In an interview last year, John le CarrÃ© talked about the conflict between personal and state obligation Born as David Cornwell in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, he wrote under the pseudonym of John le CarrÃ©. He studied at the university of Bern, in Switzerland, and then Oxford, before entering a career in undercover intelligence. After teaching at Eton for two years he joined the Foreign Office, and was initially based at the British Embassy in Bonn. During his time there he worked in the intelligence records department, giving him access to files with insights into the workings of the secret service. He also wrote his first novel, Call For The Dead, which was published in 1961. This meant the need for a pen name as Foreign Office officials were not allowed to publish books under their own name. In 1963, his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. Le CarrÃ© said his manuscript was approved by the secret service because they ""rightly if reluctantly"" concluded it was ""sheer fiction from start to finish"" but he said the world's press took a different view, deciding the book was ""not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side"". His career as a spy came to an end in 1964 after his name was one of many given to the Soviet Union by a double agent, an incident which inspired a plot line in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Two things stand out about this prolific and hugely successful author. Firstly, his novels were the very antithesis of the glamorous, racy world of James Bond as depicted by fellow author Ian Fleming. Whether it was the grim reality of waiting hours for an agent to cross back into West Berlin in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or the drab, grey world of Cold War MI6 that he describes in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, le CarrÃ© stripped away the glitz to reveal a world of fallible, flawed characters. Secondly, there is his extraordinary longevity. Le CarrÃ©, who spent a relatively brief period with MI6, published his first novel in the same year that the Berlin Wall went up: 1961. Yet long after the Cold War ended, decades later, he went on to diversify into writing about the arms trade, Big Pharma and the so-called War on Terror. On the few occasions I met him he seemed genuinely surprised at his own extraordinary success. Le CarrÃ© turned down literary honours and a knighthood, saying in a 2017 US interview that he was ""so suspicious of the literary world that I don't want its accolades"". ""And least of all do I want to be called Commander of the British Empire or any other thing of the British Empire,"" he added, saying it was ""emetic"" or vomit-inducing. He told CBS News' 60 Minutes: ""I don't want to posture as someone who's been honoured by the state and must therefore somehow conform with the state, and I don't want to wear the armour."" Le CarrÃ© described himself as ""English to the core"" but deplored what he saw as the aggressive nationalistic sentiment behind Brexit. ""My England would be the one that recognises its place in the EU. The jingoistic England that is trying to march us out of the EU, that is an England I don't want to know,"" he said.

"Trump rejects early White House vaccinationsThe US president asks for an ""adjustment"" to plans to vaccinate senior officials in the coming days.","This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US President Donald Trump says he has reversed a plan for White House officials to receive a coronavirus vaccine in the coming days. Officials said senior members of the Trump administration would be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. But Mr Trump later tweeted that people working at the White House ""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". The US will begin its roll out of the vaccine on Monday. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to dozens of locations in all 50 states across the US. The first shipment of those doses left a facility in Michigan on Sunday, with health workers and the elderly in line to receive the first shots. Can people with allergies have the Covid vaccine? US faces bleak winter amid worst virus wave yet Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US News on Sunday that White House staff would be among the first to be vaccinated drew criticism on social media. It was not clear why Mr Trump decided to change the plans, or what effect it would have on the government's efforts to protect top officials. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US, with a world-record daily increase of 3,309 reported on Saturday. The vaccine's rollout has been framed as a turning point in the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken the lives of almost 300,000 people in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its emergency-use authorisation of the vaccine, announced on Friday, was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, after it came under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the jab. Doses of the same vaccine are already being administered in the UK. The Pfizer vaccine has received regulatory approval in Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well. The beginning of the vaccination drive in the US comes as the Electoral College - the system which elects US presidents - isset to endorse Joe Biden's victory on Monday. Officials told several media outlets on Sunday that some of the first vaccines would be reserved for those who work in close proximity to Mr Trump. The vaccination plan, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Ullyot. One aim of the programme was to build public confidence in the vaccine, he said. ""The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership,"" Mr Ullyot said. But Mr Trump on Sunday suggested that top officials would now have to wait longer. ""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,"" he said in a tweet.,external""I have asked that this adjustment be made."" The US president, who contracted coronavirus in October and recovered after treatment in hospital, said he was not yet scheduled to take the vaccine but looked forward to doing so ""at the appropriate time"". He has previously claimed to be ""immune"", even though medical experts say it is unclear whether people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second infection, and if so, how long this protection might last. Boxes containing Pfizer's vaccine are being shipped across the US There have been a number of coronavirus outbreaks in the White House, with several senior staffers and officials testing positive for the disease. The latest is Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who revealed last week thathe was being treated with the same drug cocktail as the president. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Breaking|Breaking newsLondon likely to move to tier 3 amid rising ratesLondon highly likely to move into tier 3 after a sharp rise in coronavirus infection rates that have left health officials âdeeply concernedâUK,"The weekend saw crowded shopping streets in London, which is currently under tier two restrictions London faces a move to tier three - England's highest level of coronavirus restrictions - in the coming days, the BBC has been told. Ministers and officials are said to be ""deeply concerned"" about a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases across the capital. BBC health editor Hugh Pym reports London MPs have been briefed on the data, but no decision has been taken. London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged ministers to act ""with open eyes"" and avoid damaging the capital's economy. He said tier three could have a ""catastrophic consequence"" for hospitality, culture and some retail, as pubs and restaurants would be limited to takeaways or deliveries. Council leaders in London are understood to be alarmed at the projected rise in cases and some are pushing for a ""tier three plus"" regime with tougher restrictions than tier three on its own. Essex may also be moved from tier two to tier three, which would see hotels largely closed, sports fans excluded from events, and residents advised against travelling to other areas. London mayor calls for schools to close early What are the rules if my area moves to tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live With Kent, Medway and Slough already under tier three rules, large parts of south-east England could soon join much of the Midlands, North West and North East under the strictest curbs on social contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons at 15:30 GMT and later lead a Downing Street news conference. He is also due to speak to London MPs shortly before he appears in the Commons, Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said. You cannot mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except with your household or bubble You can meet in a group of up to six in other outdoor spaces, such as parks, beaches or countryside Shops, gyms and personal care services (such as hairdressing) can stay open Bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway Sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums Indoor entertainment venues - such as bowling alleys and cinemas - must stay closed People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas Read more about the tier three rules Some areas in and around London have recorded large increases in confirmed coronavirus cases over the past week. In the week to 12 November, Havering was the only area of London in the top 100 places in England with the highest infection rates, at 85th. It now has the fifth highest rate, at 506 cases per 100,000, BBC England data unit's Rob England said. Back in November, London had the third lowest regional rate of about 187 cases per 100,000, while Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest at 443 per 100,000. Now the two regions seem to have swapped places, with Yorkshire enjoying the third lowest rate of about 170 per 100,000. Hugh Pym described the situation as ""fast-moving"" and that he understood health officials presented data showing a sharp rise in virus cases - risking further rapid increases in the coming days. The east of London and the bits of Essex and Kent that border it have now become the hotspots for Covid. Cases are rising and there are several east London boroughs that have seen more than 350 cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, Manchester which is in tier three, has seen 176 cases per 100,000 in the past seven days. What has provided some protection for London is the fact hospitals have not been at immediate risk of being overwhelmed. Latest data from London from a week ago showed one in nine beds were available. But admissions have continued to go up since - causing real concern behind the scenes. Other parts of the capital have lower rates, but there are signs they are rising too. That's why the government feels it has little option but to act. Experts warned last week that London should be placed in tier threeimmediately to avoid an increase in coronavirus deaths. But at the time the Department of Health said a review of tiers would happen every 14 days, with the next due on 16 December. Meanwhile, London's mayor has urged the government to ask all secondary schools and colleges in the capital to close early ahead of Christmas. Sadiq Khan said he also wanted an extended break for schools as there are ""significant"" Covid outbreaks among 10 to 19-year-olds. Islington Council has followed Greenwich in advising schools to switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Downing Street said it expects all schools and colleges in England to remain open until the end of term on Thursday. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Despite coronavirus cases continuing to rise, No 10 said the government ""has no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which effectively suspend the tier system of restrictions and allow more households to mix. It came as people in Scotlandwere told to ""cut down"" the number of contacts in the week before Christmasif they plan to meet up with relatives. In Wales, a second health boardhas suspended non-urgent care amid a continued rise in cases. And a leading doctor in Northern Irelandsaid its health service is facing a ""nightmare"" scenarioin January. Elsewhere, Covid vaccinations have started being given to patients at GP surgeries in Englandas part of the next stage of the rollout of the vaccine programme. Overall on Sunday, confirmed cases rose by 19% across the UK compared with the previous seven days, with 18,447 reported. A further 144 deaths were also recorded.

Blood donation rules relaxed for gay menMen who have sex with men in a long-term relationship will now be able to donate blood at any time.UK,"Blood donation rules for gay and bisexual men are being relaxed across the UK, in what the government is calling a ""landmark change"". The new criteria focuses on individual behaviours, lifting a blanket ban for any men who have had sex with men in the last three months. It means men who have sex with men in a long-term relationship will now be able to donate blood at any time. The changes will be implemented by summer 2021. All blood donors who have had one sexual partner and who have been with their sexual partner for more than three months, will now be eligible to donate regardless of their gender, the gender of their partner, or the type of sex they have. Under previous rules, all men who have sex with men had to abstain from sex for three months in order to donate. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs - which advises UK health departments - recommended the changes after examining the latest evidence relating to blood donation and sexual behaviour. If donors have had more than one sexual partner or a new partner in the last three months, they can donate as long as they have not had anal sex. Having anal sex is one of the sexual behaviours that carries the most risk of a sexually transmitted infection. Acknowledging that ""all donors"" have potential to carry infections, including heterosexual men and women, the government claims the UK has now become one of the first countries in the world to adopt a ""more individualised risk-based approach"" to donor selection criteria. The gay men breaking blood donation rules Gay blood donor rules 'irrelevant' The For the Assessment of Individualised Risk (Fair) steering group is a collaboration of UK blood services and LGBT charities. The group conducted extensive research into the risks associated with more individualised blood donor selection policies. In a report published on Monday, Fair proposes moving away from the previous blanket three-month deferral for men who have had sex with men. Instead, they have opted for identifying a wider range of ""high risk behaviours"" which apply to all blood donors, regardless of their sexuality. The group states that these changes will still maintain a ""world-leading"" safe supply of blood in the UK, which is echoed by Su Brailsford, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant. She said: ""Patients rely on the generosity and altruism of donors for their life-saving blood. I'm pleased to have concluded that these new changes to donor selection will keep blood just as safe."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock called this a ""positive step"" as it recognises individuals for the actions they take ""rather than their sexual preference"". He concluded: ""This landmark change to blood donation is safe and it will allow many more people, who have previously been excluded by donor selection criteria, to take the opportunity to help save lives."" Campaigners have welcomed the relaxation of rules. The BBC previously uncovered howsome gay and bisexual men were breaking the three-month rule in order to donate blood. One of the sexually active men claimed the three-month rule for all men who have sex with men was ""rooted in deep homophobia"". Ethan Spibey, founder of FreedomToDonate, said his group has been campaigning for these restrictions to be updated for more than six years and they ""warmly welcome"" this announcement. ""Simply being a man who has sex with men is not a good enough reason to exclude someone from donating blood,"" he added. Also welcoming the change, Dr Michael Brady, medical director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""There is certainly more work to do and we will continue to work to ensure that our blood donation service is inclusive, evidence based and both maximises the numbers who can donate while ensuring our blood supply is safe.""

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas.

""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas.

Bieber teams up with NHS choir for Christmas songThe Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir join forces with Justin Bieber to go for Christmas number one.Entertainment & Arts,"The NHS Choir recorded their half of the duet at Abbey Road Studios Justin Bieber has teamed up with a choir of nurses, doctors and other NHS staff to record a Christmas single. The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir have added their voices to a remix of the star's single Holy, which reached number seven in October. The charity collaboration comes five years after the two acts were locked in a battle for the Christmas number one. Bieber eventually threw his weight behind the choir's efforts,leading them to clinch the festive top spot. Afterwards, Bieber said: ""I was honoured to meet everyone from the choir and I'm really happy that they got their number one."" Their new charity single is also aiming for Christmas number one, with proceeds to be split between NHS Charities Together, which represents more than 230 NHS charities, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Charity. Bieber said he was ""humbled to team up"" with the singers. Bieber presented the choir with their sales award after A Bridge Over You topped the charts in 2015 Choir member Pamela Lutalo, who worked on a 30-bed Covid ward this year, said Holy was ""a song of appreciation to families, friends, colleagues and community who have provided encouragement and support to people during the pandemic"". Mike Corr, a former immunisation clinical co-ordinator, added: ""The message that holding someone is such a special thing that it's almost a holy experience is so resonant with current difficulties and personal challenges. ""There are some special people I miss terribly and I hear them say, 'Hold me, hold me,' when all this is over."" Holy is not the only song vying for this year's UK Christmas number one, which will be unveiled on BBC Radio 1 on Christmas Day. Here are some of the other contenders: LadBaby - Don't Stop Me Eatin'.YouTuber LadBaby has announced he's aiming for a third consecutive Christmas number one with this comedy cover of Journey's Don't Stop Believing. The single will raise money for the Trussell Trust, which has seen a huge surge in demand for food parcels during the pandemic. Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas Is You.The star's festive classictopped the UK chart for the first timelast week, after being streamed 10.8 million times. It could easily hold on to the number one position until Christmas. Liam Gallagher - All You're Dreaming Of.Billed as ""Imagine meets Wonderful Life"", Gallagher's tender ballad is raising money for children's charity Action For Children. Gallagher has described the song as ""perfect for this time of year, considering the year that we've all had"". Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Blood donation rules relaxed for gay menMen who have sex with men in a long-term relationship will now be able to donate blood at any time.,"Blood donation rules for gay and bisexual men are being relaxed across the UK, in what the government is calling a ""landmark change"". The new criteria focuses on individual behaviours, lifting a blanket ban for any men who have had sex with men in the last three months. It means men who have sex with men in a long-term relationship will now be able to donate blood at any time. The changes will be implemented by summer 2021. All blood donors who have had one sexual partner and who have been with their sexual partner for more than three months, will now be eligible to donate regardless of their gender, the gender of their partner, or the type of sex they have. Under previous rules, all men who have sex with men had to abstain from sex for three months in order to donate. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs - which advises UK health departments - recommended the changes after examining the latest evidence relating to blood donation and sexual behaviour. If donors have had more than one sexual partner or a new partner in the last three months, they can donate as long as they have not had anal sex. Having anal sex is one of the sexual behaviours that carries the most risk of a sexually transmitted infection. Acknowledging that ""all donors"" have potential to carry infections, including heterosexual men and women, the government claims the UK has now become one of the first countries in the world to adopt a ""more individualised risk-based approach"" to donor selection criteria. The gay men breaking blood donation rules Gay blood donor rules 'irrelevant' The For the Assessment of Individualised Risk (Fair) steering group is a collaboration of UK blood services and LGBT charities. The group conducted extensive research into the risks associated with more individualised blood donor selection policies. In a report published on Monday, Fair proposes moving away from the previous blanket three-month deferral for men who have had sex with men. Instead, they have opted for identifying a wider range of ""high risk behaviours"" which apply to all blood donors, regardless of their sexuality. The group states that these changes will still maintain a ""world-leading"" safe supply of blood in the UK, which is echoed by Su Brailsford, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant. She said: ""Patients rely on the generosity and altruism of donors for their life-saving blood. I'm pleased to have concluded that these new changes to donor selection will keep blood just as safe."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock called this a ""positive step"" as it recognises individuals for the actions they take ""rather than their sexual preference"". He concluded: ""This landmark change to blood donation is safe and it will allow many more people, who have previously been excluded by donor selection criteria, to take the opportunity to help save lives."" Campaigners have welcomed the relaxation of rules. The BBC previously uncovered howsome gay and bisexual men were breaking the three-month rule in order to donate blood. One of the sexually active men claimed the three-month rule for all men who have sex with men was ""rooted in deep homophobia"". Ethan Spibey, founder of FreedomToDonate, said his group has been campaigning for these restrictions to be updated for more than six years and they ""warmly welcome"" this announcement. ""Simply being a man who has sex with men is not a good enough reason to exclude someone from donating blood,"" he added. Also welcoming the change, Dr Michael Brady, medical director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""There is certainly more work to do and we will continue to work to ensure that our blood donation service is inclusive, evidence based and both maximises the numbers who can donate while ensuring our blood supply is safe.""

LiveLiveCovid vaccination roll-out widens in UK7 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells people to be vigilant, after new variant of Covid-19 found in parts of UK Hancock says it's thought the variant is contributing to faster spread in southern England But he says there is no indication it causes worse illness or will not respond to vaccine London will move into the highest level of virus restrictions, tier 3, at 00:01 on Wednesday Parts of Essex and Hertfordshire will also move to tier 3 on the same day More than 34 million people will then be in tier three, 21.5 million in tier two and about 700,000 in tier one A nurse in New York City is thought to be the first New Yorker - and possibly first American - to receive the Pfizer jab Downing Street says schools should stay open, after two London councils move to online lessons New Zealand agrees to a quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia âin principleâ Germany is to go into a hard lockdown over the Christmas period Eswatini Prime Minister dies with Covid-19 - believed to be the first world leader in office to do so Edited by Claire Heald Many thanks for joining us for news on the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plantOfficials will hold discussions with France's EDF about funding the Sizewell C project in Suffolk.,"Sizewell C (lighter grey on the right) would be built next to Sizewell B, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned The government has begun talks with EDF about the construction of a new Â£20bn nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The Sizewell C site could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to provide 7% of the UK's needs. But it has proved controversial with campaigners saying it is ""ridiculously expensive"" and that taxpayers will have to foot the bill for extra costs. The government said any deal would be subject to approval on areas such as value for money and affordability. EDF, the French energy giant, is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear energy plant in Somerset in partnership with China General Nuclear Power. The government said talks with EDF about Sizewell C would depend on the progress of the Hinkley Point C. However,that project is set to cost up to Â£2.9bn more than originally thoughtand will be up to 15 months late. China General Nuclear Power has a 20% stake in Sizewell C but is thought to be planning to pull out after security concerns were raised about a Chinese state-owned company designing and running its own design nuclear reactor on UK soil. If it does pull out, it would increase the need for new investors. One option could be for the government to take a stake in the plant. Power plant bosses 'are listening to locals' Automatic switching plan for fairer energy tariffs UK climate plan: What do the terms mean? Monday's announcement is part of the long-awaited Energy White Paper, which ministers say will support up to 220,000 jobs over the next decade. The paper sets out specific steps to cut emissions from industry, transport and buildings. The policies should remove 230 million metric tonnes of emissions, which is equivalent to taking 7.5 million petrol cars off the road, the government says. The paper outlines a policy to boost competition in the energy retail market to tackle the ""loyalty penalty"" in which long-standing customers pay more than new ones. It will also provide at least Â£6.7bn in support to the fuel poor and most vulnerable over the next six years.Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plant The government has always been clear that it remains committed to new nuclear power to meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. With other nuclear projects suffering recent setbacks, and an identical plant already under construction in Somerset, Sizewell was the clear front runner to get approval. The high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables like offshore wind make a Â£20bn project like this controversial, but the enormous quantities of low carbon non-intermittent electricity it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out. Any final decision to build the plant will be subject to a full regulatory and planning approval process. Some local opposition groups claim the project will damage the surrounding environment and important wildlife habitats, but there is also local support for the number of high quality jobs it will bring to an area which includes areas of high unemployment. Commenting on the talks with EDF, the government said they would hinge on how Hinkley Point C is progressing, ""and the developer's application of lessons learnt from Hinkley Point C across to Sizewell C from development and design, through construction and commissioning, and into operations"". Hinkley Point is now estimated to cost between Â£21.5bn and Â£22.5bn, with EDF blaming ""challenging ground conditions"". If the Sizewell C plant proceeds, it could create thousands of new jobs during construction and operation, the government said. ""We are starting negotiations with EDF, it is not a green light on the construction,"" Business and Energy Secretary Alok Sharma told the BBC's Today programme. ""The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine,"" he said - referring to the variability of renewable power. Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the news. ""Building new nuclear capacity will give us a vital tool to help meet our global climate obligations,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist. The Nuclear Industry Association's chief executive, Tom Greatrex said: ""Sizewell is a vital next step towards the net zero power mix we need for the future. ""As well as at least 60 years of constantly available clean electricity, this project will provide thousands of highly-skilled, well-paid and long-term jobs across the supply chain, at a time when they are badly needed."" EDF is also building the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset But campaigners hit out at the plans. ""The idea that it could provide value for money is pie in the sky,"" said Alison Downes from the Stop Sizewell C campaign. ""Sizewell C remains too slow and expensive to help our climate emergency, and both the government and any pension funds considering the project must beware the reputational risk of investing in a still unproven reactor design."" Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""When renewables costs are plummeting, it's madness to waste Â£20bn on another nuclear white elephant, ""It will leave consumers with higher bills, destroy important habitats and unlikely to be online till the late 2030s."" Talking about the energy white paper, Mr Sharma said: ""Today's plan establishes a decisive and permanent shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels, towards cleaner energy sources that will put our country at the forefront of the global green industrial revolution."" The paper says that electricity demand will double due to transport and low carbon heat. It proposes that by the mid-2030s, all newly-installed heating systems should be low carbon or to be able to be converted to a clean fuel supply. Co-incidentally, on Monday the government faced criticism over two existing climate policies. The Commons Environmental Audit Committee said the recently-imposed Green Homes Grant to help householders insulate their homes faced serious problems. It said most people had difficulty using the website, and many could not find a contractor to install insulation. Separately, the UK Energy Research Centre - a government-funded consortium of academics - said the government's policy of banning the sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 was insufficient. It said ministers needed to tax such vehicles heavily now, or people would still be buying them in 2029 and running them for a couple of decades.

GPs in England to begin offering Covid vaccine,"Covid vaccinations will start being given to patients from GP surgeries in England as part of the next stage of the rollout of the programme. GP practices in more than 100 locations will receive their first deliveries of the vaccine later, the NHS said. Some will start vaccinating on Monday afternoon, with the majority getting under way on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people in the UKreceived the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last week in hospitals. Like last week, GP practices will prioritise over-80s, along with health and care staff. Dr Simon Hodes, a GP from Watford who will begin vaccinations on Monday, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme patients are welcoming their jab offers with ""great excitement"". He said calls to at-risk over-80s showed very few of his patients had worries about the vaccine. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? ""They've been reading the news - they know it's safe - and they're keen to have it,"" he said. He added that his surgery has a ""military[-style] operation"" to ensure doses of the vaccine are not wasted - with a list of health workers drawn up if doses are going spare. Dr Nikita Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, urged people waiting for coronavirus vaccinations to be patient. ""There's a huge range of things that general practices are already doing so if we can ask for people to just wait a moment and wait to be contacted that would be very appreciated,"" she told Today. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast arrangements were in place ""to make sure the distribution of vaccines is not in any way disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He added that there would be ""some millions"" of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK before Christmas. ""We are going as fast as we can in terms of the vaccination programme,"" he said. Once the vaccine is delivered, there will be no messing around. GP practices will receive batches containing 975 doses. These will have been thawed out - they are kept in ultra-cold storage in hospital - which means practices only have three-and-a-half days to use them up. It will be all hands on deck therefore with GPs, practice nurses and health care assistants working together to vaccinate the over-80s. The 100 or so practices getting the vaccine on Monday will be followed by another 100 to 200 over the course of the week. The rest of the network of 1,200 designated practices - each local area has been asked to nominate one practice to deliver the vaccine - are expected to follow in the coming weeks. But that will depend on supply. There's thought to be fewer than one million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the country - although more is due to arrive from Belgium soon. What could change the whole speed of rollout is approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Regulators are currently assessing the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine, of which there are already over five million doses available. Care home residents in England are also expected to receive their first vaccine later this week, along with other parts of the UK, the NHS said. Roll-out to care homes - the highest priority for vaccination - had been held up by strict rules governing the handling of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -70C. But the regulator is expected to give the green light to vaccinators taking the jab into care homes in the coming days. In Scotland, family doctors are helping deliver the vaccination programme via hospital hubs but England is the first part of the UK to roll out the jab through GP practices. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, acknowledged there were ""logistical challenges"" to the rollout but said GPs had ""an excellent track record of delivering mass vaccination programmes"". He added: ""We won't be vaccinating everyone all at once - it will be a relatively small number at first - but as long as there is supply, GPs and our teams at selected sites will start vaccinating people this week, starting with our most vulnerable patients."" He urged people not to contact their GP enquiring about vaccination, saying patients would be contacted when it was their turn to get the jab. It comes as a further 18,447 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Recorded deaths tend to be lower over the weekend due to reporting delays. Ministers and experts have warned the rollout of the vaccine does not mean coronavirus restrictions can be suddenly relaxed. On Sunday NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England -said people must think carefully about the risk of increased social contact over Christmas, despite the rules allowing three households to mix indoors and stay overnight between 23 and 27 December.

Trump rejects early White House vaccinations,"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US President Donald Trump says he has reversed a plan for White House officials to receive a coronavirus vaccine in the coming days. Officials said senior members of the Trump administration would be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. But Mr Trump later tweeted that people working at the White House ""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". The US will begin its roll out of the vaccine on Monday. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to dozens of locations in all 50 states across the US. The first shipment of those doses left a facility in Michigan on Sunday, with health workers and the elderly in line to receive the first shots. Can people with allergies have the Covid vaccine? US faces bleak winter amid worst virus wave yet Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US News on Sunday that White House staff would be among the first to be vaccinated drew criticism on social media. It was not clear why Mr Trump decided to change the plans, or what effect it would have on the government's efforts to protect top officials. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US, with a world-record daily increase of 3,309 reported on Saturday. The vaccine's rollout has been framed as a turning point in the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken the lives of almost 300,000 people in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its emergency-use authorisation of the vaccine, announced on Friday, was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, after it came under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the jab. Doses of the same vaccine are already being administered in the UK. The Pfizer vaccine has received regulatory approval in Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well. The beginning of the vaccination drive in the US comes as the Electoral College - the system which elects US presidents - isset to endorse Joe Biden's victory on Monday. Officials told several media outlets on Sunday that some of the first vaccines would be reserved for those who work in close proximity to Mr Trump. The vaccination plan, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Ullyot. One aim of the programme was to build public confidence in the vaccine, he said. ""The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership,"" Mr Ullyot said. But Mr Trump on Sunday suggested that top officials would now have to wait longer. ""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,"" he said in a tweet.,external""I have asked that this adjustment be made."" The US president, who contracted coronavirus in October and recovered after treatment in hospital, said he was not yet scheduled to take the vaccine but looked forward to doing so ""at the appropriate time"". He has previously claimed to be ""immune"", even though medical experts say it is unclear whether people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second infection, and if so, how long this protection might last. Boxes containing Pfizer's vaccine are being shipped across the US There have been a number of coronavirus outbreaks in the White House, with several senior staffers and officials testing positive for the disease. The latest is Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who revealed last week thathe was being treated with the same drug cocktail as the president. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. This video can not be played The BBC's Karishma Vaswani is shown around a cold storage facility in Singapore The vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures, which makes distribution difficult. Special shipping containers that use dry ice will be used to transport frozen vials direct to the point of vaccination, Pfizer says. The pharmaceutical company has agreed a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses of the vaccine by March. An additional 200 million doses of a second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, will be provided by June. However this vaccine is still seeking approval in the US.

New Zealand sex worker wins sexual harassment case,"The case is being viewed as an important benchmark for sex workers' rights A New Zealand sex worker will receive a six-figure payout after filing a sexual harassment case against a business owner. The sum is part of a settlement to compensate the woman for ""emotional harm and lost earnings"", said the human rights body that represented her. The case served as a reminder that all workers have the right to freedom from sexual harassment at work, it added. New Zealand passed a law decriminalising sex work in 2003. The details of the proceedings, including the identities of those involved, is confidential. But the settlement announced on Monday was viewed as an important milestone for sex workers' rights. ""It's great to see a settlement of this type has been awarded in the context of sex work to a sex worker,"" Dame Catherine Healy, national coordinator of the New Zealand Sex Workers Collective, told the BBC. ""It takes courage to stand up in the workplace, any workplace,"" she added, saying it was a ""wake-up call"" for businesses. NZ sex work activist becomes a dame Healy was at the forefront of a long campaign to decriminalise sex work in New Zealand, arguing that it would make the profession safer. Her collective helped draft the landmark Prostitution Reform Act. It was passed in 2003, allowing brothels to operate as legitimate business and granting sex workers full employment rights. On Monday Michael Timmins, director of New Zealand's Office of Human Rights Proceedings, which represented the sex worker, said the settlement ""serves as an important reminder to businesses across the country"". ""All workers, regardless of the type of work they do, have the right to freedom from sexual harassment in the workplace. We encourage all business owners and employers to ensure that they understand and respect those rights,"" he said in a statement.

Bieber teams up with NHS choir for Christmas song,"The NHS Choir recorded their half of the duet at Abbey Road Studios Justin Bieber has teamed up with a choir of nurses, doctors and other NHS staff to record a Christmas single. The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir have added their voices to a remix of the star's single Holy, which reached number seven in October. The charity collaboration comes five years after the two acts were locked in a battle for the Christmas number one. Bieber eventually threw his weight behind the choir's efforts,leading them to clinch the festive top spot. Afterwards, Bieber said: ""I was honoured to meet everyone from the choir and I'm really happy that they got their number one."" Their new charity single is also aiming for Christmas number one, with proceeds to be split between NHS Charities Together, which represents more than 230 NHS charities, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Charity. Bieber said he was ""humbled to team up"" with the singers. Bieber presented the choir with their sales award after A Bridge Over You topped the charts in 2015 Choir member Pamela Lutalo, who worked on a 30-bed Covid ward this year, said Holy was ""a song of appreciation to families, friends, colleagues and community who have provided encouragement and support to people during the pandemic"". Mike Corr, a former immunisation clinical co-ordinator, added: ""The message that holding someone is such a special thing that it's almost a holy experience is so resonant with current difficulties and personal challenges. ""There are some special people I miss terribly and I hear them say, 'Hold me, hold me,' when all this is over."" Holy is not the only song vying for this year's UK Christmas number one, which will be unveiled on BBC Radio 1 on Christmas Day. Here are some of the other contenders: LadBaby - Don't Stop Me Eatin'.YouTuber LadBaby has announced he's aiming for a third consecutive Christmas number one with this comedy cover of Journey's Don't Stop Believing.

"Windrush victims to get more compensationPeople wrongly threatened because of immigration policy changes could get up to Â£100,000.UK Politics","This video can not be played Priti Patel says she âalways promised to listen and actâ and that it was her mission to âcorrect the wrongs of the pastâ. The government is to give more money to victims of the Windrush scandal, which saw hundreds of people wrongly threatened with deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the minimum payment will rise from Â£250 to Â£10,000, and the maximum from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000. The figure will be higher still in ""exceptional"" circumstances, with money coming through quicker than before. The Windrush scandal mainly affected UK citizens originally from the Caribbean. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when ""hostile environment"" immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under then Home Secretary Theresa May. UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? The scandal broke in 2018, including the revelation that many of those affected had lost homes and jobs and had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The BBC's Westminster Hour reported last month that at least nine people had died while awaiting payments under the compensation scheme set up for victims. By Jack Fenwick, Westminster Hour Campaigners for the Windrush victims are likely to ask why this announcement by the home secretary didn't come sooner. The government acted quickly in setting up the Windrush Compensation Scheme when the scandal became public in 2018, but that scheme has long been criticised for being too slow and resulting in offers some say are too low. The speed at which claims are processed and money is offered is seen as being particularly crucial, given that many of those affected are elderly. The additional announcement that the compensation process for loss of earnings will also change could potentially lead to even larger payouts for victims. Early responses from claimants suggest a sense of cautious optimism at the latest announcement, with one person telling me they won't believe it until a cheque is in the post. The Windrush Compensation Scheme will be updated following consultation with the Windrush Working Group, chaired by Bishop Derek Webley. Ms Patel told the House of Commons there would be ""substantial changes"". She added that these would ""make a real difference to people's lives"", saying: ""I've always promised to listen and act to ensure that the victims of Windrush receive the maximum amount of compensation they deserve. ""It's my mission to correct the wrongs of the past and I will continue to work with the Windrush Working Group to do exactly that."" The changes to the scheme will apply retrospectively, meaning those previously given less than Â£10,000 will receive top-up payments. The Home Office is also removing the 12 months' salary limit on compensation for earnings lost by people forced out of their jobs. It will start letting those affected by the changes know from next week. Bishop Webley said: ""Many will benefit from the relief that these new payments will provide, and begin to move forward with their lives with hope and determination."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report last month said government action taken to ""record and respond to negative equality impacts"" of hostile environment immigration policies had been ""perfunctory, and therefore insufficient"". It called for a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"", with the commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, describing the treatment of the Windrush generation as ""a shameful stain on British history"". The Windrush compensation scheme came into force last year, with Â£2m being paid out so far and a further Â£1m offered.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris
Whitty says the virus will âcontinue to produce mutations over timeâ, adding that many
of these will die out, some will be neutral, and some will have new properties. He says, in the long run, there may be an issue that new variants
will evolve which are less affected by vaccines. He says this may mean we have to
re-vaccinate over time, like we do with flu. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health Englandâs (PHE) regional director
for London, is asked about how the vaccine programme is working in London. He says he knows many Londoners have questions about the
vaccine but he say it is âhighly effectiveâ and PHE are working to educate different
communities to ensure everyone has the information they need. He says the vaccine is one of the âkeys to unlock the door
to the end of this pandemic"" and he would encourage all Londoners to take up the
opportunity of the vaccine âwhen they are able toâ. Prof Chris Whitty - the government's chief medical adviser - is asked again about Christmas. Is
it wise to relax the restrictions to such an extent - and what will the impact
be? ""All of this is about balancing the wider needs of society with the need to get the virus under control,"" he says. He describes the five-day relaxation in rules as ""relatively modest actually"". But he stresses that the level of impact on infections is related to ""how many people choose to do this in a very minimalist, responsible way and those who wish to choose to come together and do all sorts of things which they otherwise wouldn't be doing if it wasn't for Christmas"". ""The key thing is people have just got to be sensible,"" he says. Kate Proctor of Politics Home asks when the variant was discovered, in which other countries it has been found and whether the symptoms are exactly the same. Prof Whitty doesn't give an exact answer on when or where it was discovered. However he does confirm that there is ""no evidence that the symptoms are any worse or different with this variant"". He says the main reason ""we are bringing it to people's attention"" is because it appears to be spreading more quickly. But he insists that the variant is not the reason behind putting more areas into tier three. Matt Hancock says it is ""a tribute to British science and in particular the support that has gone into genomics that we are in a position to identify this strain"". The BBC's Vicki Young also asked Prof Chris Whitty about the new variant of coronavirus which is spreading in the south east - and the possible repercussions. Prof Whitty says the reason this has been picked up is because of the UK's good surveillance system. He says we don't know if it's getting more frequent because it's in a part of the country where the rate of increase is faster anyway, or whether this variant of the virus is possible to transmit more easily. And he says there are three questions that scientists are asking about it:  There's a question about the risk of the virus spreading
widely across the country during the Christmas period. Matt Hancock reiterates that people need to behave very carefully
during Christmas and âtake personal responsibilityâ. Asked about whether the current tier system is fit for purpose, Prof Chris Whitty says parts of northern England and the
Midlands have seen their rates come down and stay down using measures similar
to tier three, while he says many others have managed to âhold the lineâ in tier two. However, he says in London the situation has âescalatedâ and
itâs ânow clearly a time to moveâ to tier three. He says that it would be very difficult to get on top of
things in Essex and other parts of the South East while London rates are
continuing to rise because âthereâs so much traffic in and out of London from
all aroundâ. âItâs very important for everywhere that London is going
into tier three today,â he adds. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Attention is naturally turning to the wisdom of the
relaxation of rules over Christmas. A week after London and some surrounding
areas enter tier three, which prohibits mixing both indoors and outdoors except
in public open spaces such as parks, people will be free to get together in
groups of three households. Ministers and their advisers are warning people to exercise
caution. But there are no plans to re-think the guidance. Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty accepts there is
risk, but says the government is trying to strike a âreally difficult
balanceâ.  Meeting up with loved ones was seen as an important choice to
give people after such a difficult year â and there was also concern people
would ignore any restrictions if they tried to prevent mixing. While the rules will relax, a tier system of sorts still remains in
place. For example, in tier three areas hospitality will not be able
to open beyond offering takeaways. That should mitigate some of the risk, but clearly not all.
The hope had been that after the second national lockdown and the introduction
of a tougher system of tiers, that would have been enough to keep the rates of
infections coming down. That has not happened in the south east, but is happening elsewhere,
across large parts of the north of England, the south west and some parts of
the Midlands. The message is clear â it will be up to the public to weigh up
the risks for themselves. Sky's Sam Coates asks if there are any circumstances under which the government would reverse its planned relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks if London should have been put into tier three weeks ago. Matt Hancock says he understands why people want to se their loved ones at Christmas, but that must be done in a way that is ""careful and responsible"". On the question about London, Prof Whitty says going into tier 3 reduces transmission but also does economic damage and that the government has to balance the two. He says it isn't possible to achieve perfection when ""choosing between two bad situations"". Prof Fenton says Londoners have been ""fantastic"" at responding to the pandemic. He says today's measures are aimed at helping ""us get ahead of the curve"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Although Matt Hancock has said this is a critical moment for
London, many people are due to leave the city for Christmas in as little as
nine days when the restrictions are relaxed. Itâs clear that the politicians and medical experts want
people to think carefully about that decision. Prof Whitty has described it as a period of risk and
urged people not to go any further than they need to. Hancock has also made clear he wants people to be cautious
â but insists people may want to get together after a difficult year. The next question comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks whether the government reckons it should be rethinking plans to relax rules over Christmas? From 23-27 December rules are being relaxed to allow three households to mix. Mr Hancock says it's ""important"" that all of us are cautious and ""very careful"" over Christmas. But he says that ""especially after a difficult year"", he understands why people want to get together with their loved ones. Prof Chris Whitty is also asked what he thinks of the Christmas rules, and says ""it's no secret... Christmas is a period of greater risk"". But he says they have tried to strike the balance of doing what is ""least damaging"" while keeping the virus under control. And he urged people to take the tiers seriously before Christmas to reduce the risk as much as possible. ""Go no further than you have to,"" he said, of the relaxation in rules. Prof Kevin Fenton, Public Health England's regional director for London, said ""the actions we take now"" will affect our ability to have a safe Christmas. ""The restrictions in the tiers will still be in place. But the Christmas period allows us to meet those who are nearest and dearest to us but also taking care to prevent the transmission to them as well."" The second question is from Becky in Gateshead who asks
about whether the Covid-19 vaccine will affect fertility, as she is hoping to
start a family. Prof Chris Whitty says there is âno current evidenceâ of an impact on fertility from any of the vaccines and he says it would be âquite surprisingâ if they did so. âThis is not an area that people should be concerned about at this
point in time,â he says. He points out that the vaccine is currently being rolled out
to elderly people - who will not be thinking about fertility - and the focus is on
getting these groups vaccinated. Reality Check The latest regional data highlights the problems facing
London. After weeks of higher case rates, the north of England and
the Midlands are now seeing sustained decreases. But the capital â along with parts of the south east of
England â is seeing coronavirus cases increase. London now has the highest weekly case rates of any region
in England - with 191 cases per 100,000 people, for the week ending 6 December. And 10% of tests for Covid-19 are coming back positive â the
highest rate in England. This is still quite far below the peaks seen in the North
West in October and lower than where London was when the national lockdown
started in November. Importantly, the spread of the virus has happened across all
age groups, meaning that it isnât confined to younger people (who are less
vulnerable and less likely to be treated in hospital). The rate amongst 10 to 19 year-olds is particularly high and,
in the past, this has preceded increases in older groups. The first question comes from Ryan, a nurse in A&E. He wants to know if there will be a ""firebreak"" lockdown in January following the relaxation of rules over Christmas. He also asks how the government will support hospitals to deal with the extra pressure. Matt Hancock urges people to be ""careful and cautious, especially ahead of Christmas"". In terms of protecting hospitals, he says the government will be reviewing the tier system to determine ""which areas should be in which tiers so we can keep this virus under control"". Prof Whitty repeats the call for people to be ""very careful"" and warns that the period after Christmas could be ""extremely difficult for every area of A&E"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Windrush victims to get more compensationPeople wrongly threatened because of immigration policy changes could get up to Â£100,000.","This video can not be played Priti Patel says she âalways promised to listen and actâ and that it was her mission to âcorrect the wrongs of the pastâ. The government is to give more money to victims of the Windrush scandal, which saw hundreds of people wrongly threatened with deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that the minimum payment will rise from Â£250 to Â£10,000, and the maximum from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000. The figure will be higher still in ""exceptional"" circumstances, with money coming through quicker than before. The Windrush scandal mainly affected UK citizens originally from the Caribbean. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when ""hostile environment"" immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under then Home Secretary Theresa May. UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? The scandal broke in 2018, including the revelation that many of those affected had lost homes and jobs and had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The BBC's Westminster Hour reported last month that at least nine people had died while awaiting payments under the compensation scheme set up for victims. By Jack Fenwick, Westminster Hour Campaigners for the Windrush victims are likely to ask why this announcement by the home secretary didn't come sooner. The government acted quickly in setting up the Windrush Compensation Scheme when the scandal became public in 2018, but that scheme has long been criticised for being too slow and resulting in offers some say are too low. The speed at which claims are processed and money is offered is seen as being particularly crucial, given that many of those affected are elderly. The additional announcement that the compensation process for loss of earnings will also change could potentially lead to even larger payouts for victims. Early responses from claimants suggest a sense of cautious optimism at the latest announcement, with one person telling me they won't believe it until a cheque is in the post. The Windrush Compensation Scheme will be updated following consultation with the Windrush Working Group, chaired by Bishop Derek Webley. Ms Patel told the House of Commons there would be ""substantial changes"". She added that these would ""make a real difference to people's lives"", saying: ""I've always promised to listen and act to ensure that the victims of Windrush receive the maximum amount of compensation they deserve. ""It's my mission to correct the wrongs of the past and I will continue to work with the Windrush Working Group to do exactly that."" The changes to the scheme will apply retrospectively, meaning those previously given less than Â£10,000 will receive top-up payments. The Home Office is also removing the 12 months' salary limit on compensation for earnings lost by people forced out of their jobs. It will start letting those affected by the changes know from next week. Bishop Webley said: ""Many will benefit from the relief that these new payments will provide, and begin to move forward with their lives with hope and determination."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. An Equality and Human Rights Commission report last month said government action taken to ""record and respond to negative equality impacts"" of hostile environment immigration policies had been ""perfunctory, and therefore insufficient"". It called for a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"", with the commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, describing the treatment of the Windrush generation as ""a shameful stain on British history"". The Windrush compensation scheme came into force last year, with Â£2m being paid out so far and a further Â£1m offered.

Updates were brought to you by Owen Amos, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Robert Greenall, Emma Harrison, Claire Heald, Max Matza, Penny Spiller, Kate Whannel and Katie Wright. There were 20,263 new cases of Covid-19 in the UK on Monday, latest figures show, taking the total figure
over the past seven days to 131,708. That's up 21.6% compared with the
previous seven-day number. There were 232 new deaths from the disease reported within 28 days of a positive test, with
the seven-day total rising to 2,984, almost unchanged from the
previous seven days. Since the start of the pandemic, the UK has
recorded 1.87 million cases of Covid-19 and 64,402 deaths. We will shortly be pausing the live page, so here's a reminder of the main headlines in the UK today:   Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a five-week lockdown which will last until 19 January. From Tuesday, all non-essential shops, including garden centres, DIY and clothing stores will close. Supermarkets and other food shops, banks and pharmacies will remain open. Hairdressers, tattooists, beauticians and sex workers must stop seeing clients. Museums, zoos, theatres, Christmas markets, casinos and amusement parks will close their doors, along with gyms, swimming pools and saunas. The rule of two applies at home, except for a few days over Christmas when three house guests are allowed a day. From Wednesday, both primary and secondary schools are closing - something that Rutte had been determined to avoid. Hotels will stay open, but they are no longer allowed to serve food and drink to their guests. Room service is also off the menu. Cafes and restaurants, including cannabis cafes, can keep serving takeaways. The Eredivisie league and other top sports competitions will continue, but without an audience - as is the case now. Kinkerstraat in Amsterdam, pictured on Monday ahead of Rutte's announcement Schiphol airport remains open to passengers. The travel advice remains to stay at home as much as possible this winter and not to book trips abroad until mid-March. No curfew will be imposed. On Monday the Netherlands recorded 8,496 new daily infections, slightly up on the weekly average. Most people see the additional restrictions as completely justified. Many believe they should have happened weeks ago, and for some, it's going to mean a lonely Christmas. As the prime minister addressed the nation, anti-lockdown protesters could be heard outside parliament. Fans of Omah Lay and Tems have been reacting with anger on social media at their arrests Away from the drama leaving stages in the UK, two Nigerian singers have
been arrested and charged in Uganda for putting on a show that officials say
was likely to spread the coronavirus. Omah Lay and Tems, along
with Temsâ manager and four Ugandans, have been charged with ânegligently doing
acts likely to spread an infectious diseasesâ (sic),Uganda police said in a tweet,external. They will remain in
custody until their appearance in court on Wednesday, the statement added. Omah Lay, whose show was
staged in the Ugandan capital on Saturday,tweeted he was âjust a singer trying to entertainâ,external. He has called on the Nigerian authorities to intervene. Uganda has suspended all
social gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Les Miserables: The Staged Concert opened on 5 December London theatres have been reacting to the news that they must shut againas the city moves into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, calling it ""devastating"". ""After Tuesday we have no idea when theatres are to be allowed to reopen,"" said producer Cameron Mackintosh. A number of West End shows had reopened over the last two weeks, including Pantoland at the Palladium, starring Julian Clary and Elaine Paige. The Society of London Theatre said the move into tier three was ""devastating news for the city's world-leading theatre industry"", adding that it would cause ""catastrophic financial difficulties"" for venues, producers and thousands of workers. The measures mean Tuesday night will see the last live performances in London for an indefinite period. Rosie Brown and Demi Hughes are not going home for Christmas this year We've been hearing a lot today about the debate around Christmas in the UK - when coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Health experts have urged people to think carefully about who they mix with. This means many families are now having awkward conversations about what they are and aren't prepared to do. It's that extra risk which means not everyone will be taking up the option of meeting their loved ones. BBC Newsbeat reporter Manish Pandey spoke to a couple of peoplewho have decided not to go home for Christmas this year. The final questions come from the Times' Chris
Smyth, who asks whether people should now be self-isolating if they want to
see elderly relatives at Christmas. Matt Hancock says the best thing to do is
be âextremely carefulâ about who you see now. Asked again about the new variant of coronavirus, Prof Chris

GPs in England to begin offering Covid vaccineSurgeries in more than 100 locations are receiving their first deliveries of the Pfizer jab.,"Covid vaccinations will start being given to patients from GP surgeries in England as part of the next stage of the rollout of the programme. GP practices in more than 100 locations will receive their first deliveries of the vaccine later, the NHS said. Some will start vaccinating on Monday afternoon, with the majority getting under way on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people in the UKreceived the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last week in hospitals. Like last week, GP practices will prioritise over-80s, along with health and care staff. Dr Simon Hodes, a GP from Watford who will begin vaccinations on Monday, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme patients are welcoming their jab offers with ""great excitement"". He said calls to at-risk over-80s showed very few of his patients had worries about the vaccine. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? ""They've been reading the news - they know it's safe - and they're keen to have it,"" he said. He added that his surgery has a ""military[-style] operation"" to ensure doses of the vaccine are not wasted - with a list of health workers drawn up if doses are going spare. Dr Nikita Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, urged people waiting for coronavirus vaccinations to be patient. ""There's a huge range of things that general practices are already doing so if we can ask for people to just wait a moment and wait to be contacted that would be very appreciated,"" she told Today. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast arrangements were in place ""to make sure the distribution of vaccines is not in any way disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He added that there would be ""some millions"" of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the UK before Christmas. ""We are going as fast as we can in terms of the vaccination programme,"" he said. Once the vaccine is delivered, there will be no messing around. GP practices will receive batches containing 975 doses. These will have been thawed out - they are kept in ultra-cold storage in hospital - which means practices only have three-and-a-half days to use them up. It will be all hands on deck therefore with GPs, practice nurses and health care assistants working together to vaccinate the over-80s. The 100 or so practices getting the vaccine on Monday will be followed by another 100 to 200 over the course of the week. The rest of the network of 1,200 designated practices - each local area has been asked to nominate one practice to deliver the vaccine - are expected to follow in the coming weeks. But that will depend on supply. There's thought to be fewer than one million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the country - although more is due to arrive from Belgium soon. What could change the whole speed of rollout is approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Regulators are currently assessing the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine, of which there are already over five million doses available. Care home residents in England are also expected to receive their first vaccine later this week, along with other parts of the UK, the NHS said. Roll-out to care homes - the highest priority for vaccination - had been held up by strict rules governing the handling of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -70C. But the regulator is expected to give the green light to vaccinators taking the jab into care homes in the coming days. In Scotland, family doctors are helping deliver the vaccination programme via hospital hubs but England is the first part of the UK to roll out the jab through GP practices. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, acknowledged there were ""logistical challenges"" to the rollout but said GPs had ""an excellent track record of delivering mass vaccination programmes"". He added: ""We won't be vaccinating everyone all at once - it will be a relatively small number at first - but as long as there is supply, GPs and our teams at selected sites will start vaccinating people this week, starting with our most vulnerable patients."" He urged people not to contact their GP enquiring about vaccination, saying patients would be contacted when it was their turn to get the jab. It comes as a further 18,447 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Recorded deaths tend to be lower over the weekend due to reporting delays. Ministers and experts have warned the rollout of the vaccine does not mean coronavirus restrictions can be suddenly relaxed. On Sunday NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England -said people must think carefully about the risk of increased social contact over Christmas, despite the rules allowing three households to mix indoors and stay overnight between 23 and 27 December.

London mayor calls for schools to close earlySadiq Khan wants all secondary schools and colleges to close early ahead of Christmas across London.London,"Sadiq Khan wants all students to be tested for Covid-19 London's mayor has urged the government to ask all secondary schools and colleges in the capital to shut early ahead of Christmas. In a letter to ministers, Sadiq Khan said he also wanted schools to reopen later in January amid ""significant"" Covid outbreaks in 10 to 19-year-olds. It comes as the BBC was toldLondon was likely to move into tier three. Greenwich and Islington councils are the first in England to urge schools to switch this week to online learning. Council officials in Greenwichhave advised schools to shut from the end of Monday, although some academies will remain open, while Islington schools have been asked to move online from the end of Tuesday. A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was ""vital"" children remained in school until the end of term. The prime minister's official spokesman said not being in school had ""a detrimental impact on learning and other areas of pupils' development"". Regional school commissioner teams were working closely with local authorities to"" keep schools open and keep pupils and staff safe,"" he added. Sadiq Khan also urged the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy outdoor public spaces Mr Khan described the surge in Covid-19 cases in London ""deeply concerning"" and that in the last week, there had been a 75% increase in those aged 10-19 testing positive for the virus. He said ""if the government isn't careful these children will pass on the virus to really vulnerable people because the rules are relaxed"" over Christmas. ""My message to the government is if you can't keep the schools Covid safe in the last few days before Christmas, it's better to err on the side of caution and revert to online teaching for these few days."" In the letter, also sent to the prime minister, he said he wanted regular asymptomatic testing to be extended to everyone who could not work form home as well as students and staff at London's secondary schools, sixth-form college and further education colleges. He has also called for face coverings to be made mandatory in busy outdoor public spaces, ""given the numbers on our high streets in the run-up to Christmas"". ""The rollout of the vaccine has provided some light at the end of what has been a very dark tunnel, but this is no time to be complacent and we cannot let so many months of compromise and sacrifice go to waste,"" he said. ""Time is running out to get the virus under control in our city which is why I urge the government to heed my call and provide us with the extra support we desperately need. Londoners always work together - and together our city will get through the winter and can look forward to better times ahead."" Mr Khan said if London went into further restrictions, the current financial support offered by the government would be ""insufficient to keep many businesses and the self-employed afloat"". He warned if the capital moved to tier three, UK Hospitality predicted Â£2.7bn could be wiped off London's hospitality industry, with 160,000 jobs permanently at risk. Mr Khan said that if London moved to tier three, UK Hospitality had warned Â£2.7bn could be wiped off the capital's hospitality industry ""Theatres and venues in London have begun to reopen, many for the first time since March and after making their venues as safe as possible,"" he wrote. ""Several major Christmas theatre productions are scheduled in December and January in the West End alone. Last-minute cancellations of these could prove ruinous."" Mr Khan said before any additional restrictions are imposed, ministers must set up a compensation scheme for all lost income during the crucial festive period based on last year's returns. He added workers required to self-isolate must also receive full pay and not just statutory sick pay. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked tremendously hard to put protective measures in place that are helping reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted."" The Regional Schools Commissioner for the South East of England and South London would be continuing discussions with Greenwich, he added. Last week it was announced all pupils, their families and teachers in parts of London, Kent and Essex should take a Covid test with extra mobile testing units brought in. It comes as east London and parts of Kent and Essex became some of England's major coronavirus hotspots. Three in four boroughs in the city have registered an increase in Covid-19 cases,figures released last week from the Office of National Statistics show. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it supported Greenwich Council and the mayor in their call for schools to move to online learning. He said: ""The government should have been planning for this weeks ago. ""They have now started to recognise the blindingly obvious fact that transmission is happening in schools and that this can spread to families. But the government now needs to act. ""Much more is needed to control the virus in schools and to protect communities."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was ""vital"" children remained in school until the end of term Parents outside Robert Owen Nursery School and Christ Church Church of England Primary School, both in Greenwich, reacted to the news schools in the borough would be closing early. One mother said: ""I really feel for the kids. ""After a pretty up and down year, a year that hasn't been the best, it would be nice to end the year with a couple of parties but I completely understand and I think the nursery does a great job."" Many questioned the timing. One mother said: ""It's 2.5 days, so I don't see what difference this is really going to make and I think the timing of it is really, really bad. ""I'm on maternity at the moment but if I was working, it's just too short notice to get any kind of childcare arrangements in place."" One father added: ""I think the timing might be right as a lot of people will be gathering for Christmas and it takes 10 to 14 days to show up so it may be damage limitation. ""I hope it will have an impact. If not, then it's just political."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Hospital 'stuffed full' with Covid patientsIntensive care consultant says they now have more patients with Covid than don't have the virus.Wales,"This video can not be played 'Two people every five minutes are getting Covid in Swansea area' The Christmas relaxation of lockdown rules ""makes no sense"" as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Wales, doctors have warned. The Welsh Intensive Care Society also wants an ""urgent"" lockdown across Wales before Christmas, warning critical care would be unable to cope without urgent action. It comes afterthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said""nothing is off the table"". But Mr Gething fears people would ""make up their own rules"" if meeting up over Christmas was banned. Wales has thehighest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK- a seven-day average of 425 cases per 100,000 - and eight of the UK's top 10 worst infected areas are in Wales with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend the top three. In a letter to the health minister, the Welsh Intensive Care Society chairman Dr Richard Pugh warns critical care services will not be able to cope over the winter period without intervention ""at the highest level"". Christmas five-day relaxation period 'a mistake' How do Wales Covid cases compare to other nations? Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients Up to three households can stay together and form a""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, all four UK nations have agreed. But the body representing intensive care staff want that decision reviewed amid fears it will cause a surge in cases. ""Christmas is a special time but it seems a very, very difficult thing to justify,"" said Dr Pugh. ""It makes no sense viewed from a perspective of front-line staff and public health."" With 190 critical care beds already being used - almost half by coronavirus patients - Dr Pugh said critical care was already over-capacity. ""Welsh critical care services will be unable to manage rising demands relating to Covid-19, to maintain emergency non-Covid activity, and to continue providing peri-operative care for high risk urgent surgical cases in coming weeks without intervention at the highest level,"" he said. Two health boards in south Wales have already cancelled some non-urgent care - Swansea Bay andAneurin Bevan University Health Boards. This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Ambulances waited for the equivalent of a week to deliver sick patients to hospital staff at the new Â£350m Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran on Saturday. On Sunday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board apologised after a73-year-old man waited more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside that hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service said more than 10 patients had waited more than 12 hours in ambulances outside hospitals awaiting beds in the last week. The family of Ted Edwards from Monmouthshire said he waited for 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital The service has raised its alert system to its highest level, which signals ""extreme pressure"". ""We've seen more Covid-related patients in the last six weeks than than we've seen since March,"" chief executive Jason Killenstold BBC Radio Wales. ""We've more staff off sick or self-isolating since April and we've seen some of our busiest days this year in the last 10 days, with four of the last five days the busiest since the start of the pandemic."" Added to ""congestion"" outside hospital A&E departments, Mr Killen apologised as ambulance crews had ""real difficulties being able to respond in a timely way, particularly to less serious patients"". Dr Pugh said there was now a case for the cancellation of elective surgery to happen on a ""national basis"" to allow the NHS to be able to treat new patients as coronavirus cases increased. He said that while imposing more stringent rules ahead of the festive period was difficult, the impact of lockdowns took weeks to help departments. ""Viewed from a front-line perspective, I am afraid we do not have the luxury of deferring such steps until after the Christmas period,"" added the intensive care consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Denbighshire. Morriston Hospital will be one of those in Swansea only treating urgent cases Mr Gething said the situation across Wales was ""very serious"" but added it was not Wales' ""preference"" to break the Christmas rule relaxation. ""There is a lot of capital invested in that easing of the rules which all four countries signed up to,"" he said. Mr Gething said officials were now working with hospitals to look at how to send patients who were no longer infectious - especially the elderly - home. The seven-day case rate for Swansea Bay Health Board area, which treats patients in Neath Port Talbot and Swansea, now stands at 770.3 per 100,000 people. It has the second highest rate for any of the board areas in Wales, behind Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board on 870.3. There were also more than 250 Covid patients in Swansea Bay hospitals, with another 115 recovering patients. This is about a third of all patients. Allow Twitter content?

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warned the Welsh NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"" whenthe number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Waleson Saturday. Mr Gething said the Welsh NHS had experienced one of its busiest weekends of 2020 as it dealt with a combination of rising Covid cases and winter pressures. He urged people to abide by rules and regulations, adding: ""We need everyone's help to get through what remains of this year."" Covid-19 patients make up nearly 26% of all patients in hospital with 1,992 people in hospital across Wales on Sunday. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant at the new Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, warned the hospital was ""stuffed full with patients with very significant needs"". ""We have reached a tipping point, we have more patients that have Covid than don't have Covid now,"" she said. Dr Sarah Aitken, the health board's interim executive medical director, said there were now 404 patients with confirmed coronavirus in its hospitals - compared to 283 in April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never been used,"The gowns ordered from PPE Medpro were similar to that pictured here Millions of medical gowns bought for the NHS at the end of the first lockdown for Â£122m have never been used. The gowns were ordered by the government from a supplier which had set up just a month earlier, and no other companies were asked to bid for the contract. The supplier, PPE Medpro, says it had met the agreed terms. The Department of Health said all PPE must undergo rigorous checks. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks Does the NHS have enough protective gear for winter? PPE Medpro was set up as a company in May while the UK was still in the first coronavirus lockdown. At the time, hospitals across the country were reporting shortages of personal protective equipment - clothing and accessories to protect medics from the virus. Earlier this week NHS Providers, which represents English hospital trusts, told the House of Commons spending watchdog that the supply of gowns was the most ""pertinent problem"" over several months. Six weeks after it was incorporated, PPE Medpro signed a contract with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for Â£122m to supply sterile surgical gowns to the NHS in England. The contract was not opened to competition due to the exceptional urgency of the coronavirus pandemic. Sterile surgical gowns are used to reduce the risk of infection when Covid patients are put on to ventilators, for example. The DHSC told the BBC that contracts for the gowns must meet the British Standard for the sterilisation of medical devices or a ""technical equivalent"". PPE Medpro followed this second route. This required the DHSC to seek approval from the health regulator, the MHRA, for them to be used in the NHS. The contract, which shows the agreed sum of Â£122m The DHSC and MHRA declined to comment when asked for details of the approval application made for the Medpro products. There is as yet no record of PPE Medpro or either of its two Chinese suppliers on the regulator's exemptions list, although it is understood the evaluation process is now under way. PPE Medpro say they delivered 100 per cent of the contract to the terms specified. The company said it supplied the equipment ""fully in accordance with the agreed contract, which included clear terms as to technical specification and performance criteria of the products"". ""We did so in very challenging circumstances earlier this year and are very pleased to have been able to assist DHSC fully and properly at a time of national crisis,"" it added. In August the BBC revealed that 50 million face masks bought by the UK government from a different company earlier in the year would not be used in the NHS because of safety concerns. The DHSC said: ""The safety of front-line staff and patients is of paramount importance and we now have a four-month stockpile of all Covid-critical PPE in place. ""All PPE must undergo rigorous checks so they meet the safety and quality required. ""Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts and we take these checks extremely seriously.""

London council tells schools to teach online,"The London borough of Greenwich has become the first in England to ask all schools to move learning online from Tuesday amid rising Covid cases. The council's Labour leader Danny Thorpe has written to parents and head teachers saying it is justified by the ""extreme risk"" of the virus. The National Education Union said the decision was ""very sensible"". But the Department for Education said it remained a national priority to keep schools open full time. In two letters, to parents and to head teachers, Mr Thorpe explained why he is asking schools to close. ""I wouldn't be asking for this unless the risk was extreme, but with numbers rising so rapidly it is clear action is needed,"" he wrote to parents. Pupils in hotspots urged to get tested for Covid London's coronavirus levels rising, ONS says Will there be mass testing at your child's school? As a result, he said, the escalating number of cases demanded immediate action, and all schools were being asked to move teaching online from Tuesday. The council is advising them to keep buildings open for vulnerable children and those of key workers, but for all other pupils to learn remotely. Mr Thorpe wrote to parents he was ""extremely sorry"" for the disruption this was likely to cause. To head teachers he wrote it had become clear rates of Covid-19 were rising extremely rapidly and he couldn't ""in all good conscience standby by whilst the numbers are doubling"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The call from the local authority will put schools in a difficult position as ultimately they will have to make their own decisions. Ark Greenwich Free School, which has the same autonomy as an academy, said the secondary would be remaining open. The head teacher Rhys Spiers took to social media to tell parents they had not had a confirmed case of coronavirus at the school since October and ""our teachers are in school ready to warmly welcome your children to lessons"". Schools which rely on the local authority for support may feel under more pressure to move teaching online. Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the request by Greenwich was very sensible. ""Local government is having to step in because central government is ignoring its responsibilities,"" he said The move by a Labour led authority will be regarded as a provocative move by the government, which said it remained ""a national priority"" for schools to remain open. Schools who have said they would like to move learning online have been firmly reminded that the government has the legal power to require them to stay open. But head teachers unions said a more flexible approach was needed. Paul Whiteman, from the NAHT, said the government was obsessed with a one size fits all approach, driven from Whitehall, that was not working for anyone. ""But it is working against any reasonable education objective, school leaders need flexibility to organise the best education possible in this crisis,"" he said. Geoff Barton, from the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The government's determination to force schools to provide direct classroom teaching for all pupils regardless of local circumstances with coronavirus rates is far too inflexible. "" A spokesman for the Department for Education said it was ""vital"" that children remain in school until the end of term. He said: ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked tremendously hard to put protective measures in place that are helping reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted."" The Regional Schools Commissioner for the South East of England and South London would be continuing discussions with Greenwich, he added. In a letter to the prime minister Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called for an immediate increase in testing provision across the capital - including regular asymptomatic testing being rolled out to students and staff at the city's secondary schools and colleges. ""Time is running out to get the virus under control in our city,"" he said.

Wild weather lashes Australia's east coast,"This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay as wild weather batters the country Byron Bay's famous beach has all but disappeared, as extreme weather batters Australia's east coast, officials say. Main Beach - a popular tourist destination - had already been depleted due to previous erosions. But local mayor Simon Richardson said ""severe weather"" and ""massive swells"" were smashing what was left. ""We're watching our beach disappear,"" he said. A 1,000km (620 mile) stretch of coast is being hit with torrential rain and ""abnormally high"" tides. More than 2,000 homes in cities, including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, lost electricity on Monday after strong winds struck power lines. Tides up to 8m (26ft) high were recorded, eroding the shoreline in some areas, including Byron Bay. Emergency services said they had received over 700 calls for help since Sunday. About half a dozen people stranded in floodwaters had been rescued, they added. Meteorologists have warned that this Australian summer will see the impacts of a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones. 'La NiÃ±a' weather event develops in the Pacific Australia warned on future of 'simultaneous' natural disasters The current wild weather has hit popular holiday spots such as the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast in Queensland. In Byron Bay, in the state of New South Wales, pictures showed the beach covered with water and fallen trees. ""We're seeing the largest coastal erosion we've seen in many years, particularly around the Byron Bay area, which is completely changing the entire landscape of the beaches,"" Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steve Pearce told reporters.

Many beaches were closed on Monday amid the dangerous conditions. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology issued severe weather warnings for a vast coastal area stretching from Hervey Bay in Queensland to Taree in New South Wales. Affected areas have been alerted to damaging winds, flash flooding and hazardous surf. Some places have already received more than 400mm of rain within 24 hours.

Espionage writer John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89,"British espionage writer John le CarrÃ© has died aged 89, following a short illness, his literary agent has said. The author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy died from pneumonia on Saturday. Fellow authors paid tribute, with Stephen King calling him ""a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit"". Historical fiction writer Robert Harris said le CarrÃ©, who chronicled the world of Cold War spies, was ""one of the great post-war British novelists"". Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood tweeted that his novels featuring spymaster George Smiley - described by le CarrÃ© as an ""antidote"" to James Bond - were the ""key to understanding the mid-20th Century"". Historian and novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore described le CarrÃ© as ""the titan of English literature"" and said he was ""heartbroken"". Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' author Obituary: The spy who turned into a novelist John le CarrÃ© on why 'politicians love chaos' Jonny Geller, the author's agent, said he was an ""undisputed giant of English literature"" who ""defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power"". ""We will not see his like again,"" he said in a statement. Mr Geller said he represented the novelist, whose real name was David Cornwell, for almost 15 years and ""his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition"". ""We have lost a great figure of English literature, a man of great wit, kindness, humour and intelligence. I have lost a friend, a mentor and an inspiration."" Le CarrÃ©'s novels drew on his experience working for the British intelligence services The Night Manager was a major BBC series A statement shared on behalf of the author's family said: ""It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell - John le CarrÃ© - passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness. ""David is survived by his beloved wife of almost 50 years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. ""We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness."" The statement said his death was not Covid-19 related. The decades after the end of World War Two in 1945 were dominated by political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Both sides were armed with nuclear weapons, discouraging direct warfare because of the risk that both would be totally destroyed. So until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the hostility played out in support for regional conflicts known as proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, psychological warfare and espionage - creating the inspiration for a generation of spy novels and films. Several of le CarrÃ©'s 25 works were turned into films including The Constant Gardener, The Tailor of Panama and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, while the Night Manager became a successfulBBC television series. Smiley, his most famous character who first appeared in Call for the Dead, has been played by actors including Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. Oldman, who appeared in the 2011 film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, said le CarrÃ© was ""a very great author, the true 'owner' of the serious, adult, complicated, spy novel"" and was ""always a true gentleman"". This video can not be played In an interview last year, John le CarrÃ© talked about the conflict between personal and state obligation Born as David Cornwell in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, he wrote under the pseudonym of John le CarrÃ©. He studied at the university of Bern, in Switzerland, and then Oxford, before entering a career in undercover intelligence. After teaching at Eton for two years he joined the Foreign Office, and was initially based at the British Embassy in Bonn. During his time there he worked in the intelligence records department, giving him access to files with insights into the workings of the secret service. He also wrote his first novel, Call For The Dead, which was published in 1961. This meant the need for a pen name as Foreign Office officials were not allowed to publish books under their own name. In 1963, his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. Le CarrÃ© said his manuscript was approved by the secret service because they ""rightly if reluctantly"" concluded it was ""sheer fiction from start to finish"" but he said the world's press took a different view, deciding the book was ""not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side"". His career as a spy came to an end in 1964 after his name was one of many given to the Soviet Union by a double agent, an incident which inspired a plot line in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Two things stand out about this prolific and hugely successful author. Firstly, his novels were the very antithesis of the glamorous, racy world of James Bond as depicted by fellow author Ian Fleming. Whether it was the grim reality of waiting hours for an agent to cross back into West Berlin in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or the drab, grey world of Cold War MI6 that he describes in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, le CarrÃ© stripped away the glitz to reveal a world of fallible, flawed characters. Secondly, there is his extraordinary longevity. Le CarrÃ©, who spent a relatively brief period with MI6, published his first novel in the same year that the Berlin Wall went up: 1961. Yet long after the Cold War ended, decades later, he went on to diversify into writing about the arms trade, Big Pharma and the so-called War on Terror. On the few occasions I met him he seemed genuinely surprised at his own extraordinary success. Le CarrÃ© turned down literary honours and a knighthood, saying in a 2017 US interview that he was ""so suspicious of the literary world that I don't want its accolades"". ""And least of all do I want to be called Commander of the British Empire or any other thing of the British Empire,"" he added, saying it was ""emetic"" or vomit-inducing. He told CBS News' 60 Minutes: ""I don't want to posture as someone who's been honoured by the state and must therefore somehow conform with the state, and I don't want to wear the armour."" Le CarrÃ© described himself as ""English to the core"" but deplored what he saw as the aggressive nationalistic sentiment behind Brexit. ""My England would be the one that recognises its place in the EU. The jingoistic England that is trying to march us out of the EU, that is an England I don't want to know,"" he said.

White House staff to receive early Pfizer vaccines,"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US President Donald Trump says he has reversed a plan for White House officials to receive a coronavirus vaccine in the coming days. Officials said senior members of the Trump administration would be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. But Mr Trump later tweeted that people working at the White House ""should receive the vaccine somewhat later... unless specifically necessary"". The US will begin its roll out of the vaccine on Monday. The vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to dozens of locations in all 50 states across the US. The first shipment of those doses left a facility in Michigan on Sunday, with health workers and the elderly in line to receive the first shots. Can people with allergies have the Covid vaccine? US faces bleak winter amid worst virus wave yet Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US News on Sunday that White House staff would be among the first to be vaccinated drew criticism on social media. It was not clear why Mr Trump decided to change the plans, or what effect it would have on the government's efforts to protect top officials. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US, with a world-record daily increase of 3,309 reported on Saturday. The vaccine's rollout has been framed as a turning point in the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken the lives of almost 300,000 people in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its emergency-use authorisation of the vaccine, announced on Friday, was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, after it came under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the jab. Doses of the same vaccine are already being administered in the UK. The Pfizer vaccine has received regulatory approval in Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well. The beginning of the vaccination drive in the US comes as the Electoral College - the system which elects US presidents - isset to endorse Joe Biden's victory on Monday. Officials told several media outlets on Sunday that some of the first vaccines would be reserved for those who work in close proximity to Mr Trump. The vaccination plan, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Ullyot. One aim of the programme was to build public confidence in the vaccine, he said. ""The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership,"" Mr Ullyot said. But Mr Trump on Sunday suggested that top officials would now have to wait longer. ""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,"" he said in a tweet.,external""I have asked that this adjustment be made."" The US president, who contracted coronavirus in October and recovered after treatment in hospital, said he was not yet scheduled to take the vaccine but looked forward to doing so ""at the appropriate time"". He has previously claimed to be ""immune"", even though medical experts say it is unclear whether people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second infection, and if so, how long this protection might last. Boxes containing Pfizer's vaccine are being shipped across the US There have been a number of coronavirus outbreaks in the White House, with several senior staffers and officials testing positive for the disease. The latest is Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who revealed last week thathe was being treated with the same drug cocktail as the president. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. This video can not be played The BBC's Karishma Vaswani is shown around a cold storage facility in Singapore The vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures, which makes distribution difficult. Special shipping containers that use dry ice will be used to transport frozen vials direct to the point of vaccination, Pfizer says. The pharmaceutical company has agreed a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses of the vaccine by March. An additional 200 million doses of a second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, will be provided by June. However this vaccine is still seeking approval in the US.

New Zealand and Australia agree on travel bubble,"Hop on board with no quarantine needed? New Zealand has agreed to a quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia ""in principle"". The country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said trips under the agreement could begin early next year. However, the much-anticipated deal will depend on the Covid-19 situation in both counties remaining as it is now. Travellers from New Zealand have been allowed to enter most Australian states without quarantine since October. So far though, this has been a one-way agreement - meaning they must do 14 days of managed isolation on their return to New Zealand. And Australians are not allowed into New Zealand at all, unless they have an exemption. How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Canaries holidaymakers face Christmas isolation Ms Ardern did not give a date for the travel bubble to begin and the agreement will still need to be signed off by the Australian government.

PM and EU chief agree to extend Brexit trade talks,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' The UK and EU have agreed to carry on post-Brexit trade talks after a call between leaders earlier on Sunday. In a joint statement, Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"". The pair discussed ""major unresolved topics"" during their call. The two sides had said Sunday was the deadline for a decision on whether to continue with talks, with the UK set to leave EU rules at the end of the month. The leaders agreed to tell negotiators to carry on talks in Brussels ""to see whether an agreement can even at this late stage be reached"". They did not say how long these latest talks would continue, but the ultimate deadline is 31 December, and time must be allowed for the UK and European Parliaments to vote on any deal that emerges before then. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? What happens if there's no trade deal? Mrs von der Leyen said Sunday's call with Mr Johnson had been ""constructive and useful"". But Mr Johnson repeated his warning from earlier in the week that a no deal scenario was ""most likely"". The UK and EU have been carrying out negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal since March and are attempting to secure one before the so-called transition period end on 31 December - when the two sides would move to trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Without a trade deal, tariffs - charges on goods being bought and sold between the two sides - could be introduced and, in turn, prices on certain products may go up. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Brexit negotiations would continue Reading out the joint statement, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""Despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations, despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over, we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile."" Mr Johnson later said ""where there is life, there is hope"", and that the UK ""certainly won't be walking away from the talks"". But he added: ""I've got to repeat the most likely thing now is of course that we have to get ready for WTO terms. ""As far as I can see, there are some serious and very difficult issues that currently separate the UK from EU and the best thing to do now for everybodyâ¦ [is to] get ready to trade on WTO terms."" Labour's Rachel Reeves welcomed the continuation of the talks and said the worst outcome would be to ""crash out with no deal whatsoever on 1 January"". She added: ""I hope that they [the talks] will swiftly conclude, but I also hope on behalf of all British businesses and workers, and our security as well, that the government deliver the promise they made to the British people and come back with a deal."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Talks will now continue in Brussels, with a focus expected on how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. The EU is reported to have dropped the idea of a formal mechanism to ensure both sides keep up with each other's standards and is now prepared to accept UK divergence - provided there are safeguards to prevent unfair competition. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. Business lobby group the CBI said the continuation of talks ""gives us hope"", and that a deal was ""both essential and possible"" for the UK economy. When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on rather than pull the plug. The circle around the talks is extremely tight so it is very hard to know precisely what is going on. It is possible that both sides are dangling concessions. But there is the sense now that the ground has shifted enough to make the chance of a deal worth pursuing. The political imperatives to make this happen are so strong that even tricky issues at this late stage can still potentially be fudged. It's far from certain that the talks will end in agreement, but the chances of resolution are once again on the rise. Read more from Laura here. The National Farmers' Union has warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. And the British Retail Consortium warned the public would face ""over Â£3bn in food tariffs [meaning] retailers would have no choice but to pass on some of these additional costs to their customers"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he believed a no-deal scenario ""would be very bad news for all of us"" and ""an appalling failure of statecraft"" on both sides. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, he called for the teams ""with any bit of energy we have left [to] focus on negotiating a deal"". Britons told not to stockpile food ahead of January Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit now? A number of Conservative MPs welcomed the continuation of talks, with former minister Damian Green, who backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, saying it was ""good news"" and that ""no deal would be terrible"". But leading Tory Brexiteer Sir John Redwood tweeted: ""A long complex legal agreement that locks the UK back into many features of the EU that hinder us is not the Christmas present the UK needs.""

Brexit talks process 'still has legs',"Michel Barnier is leading the EU's negotiating team in Monday's talks UK and EU negotiators have restarted talks over a post-Brexit trade deal in hope of securing an agreement. It comes after the two sides confirmed on Sunday there had been enough progress for negotiations to continue. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday there had been ""movement"" in the talks and negotiators had not exhausted all options. But a UK government source later said there had not been ""significant progress in recent days"". Time is fast running out to finalise an agreement before the UK's Brexit transition ends in just over two weeks. The decision to keep talking came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the main sticking points with President Von der Leyen on Sunday. Negotiations will continue in Brussels on Tuesday, but a new deadline for a decision has not been set. The ultimate deadline comes on 31 December, however, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? Pound gains after EU trade talks extended Without a trade deal in place by then, the two sides would begin trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, meaning taxes - or tariffs - would be introduced, potentially raising the cost of imported goods such as food. Fishing rights, ""level playing field"" rules on how far the UK should be able to diverge from EU laws, and how any agreement should be policed remain the major stumbling blocks. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has resumed talks with his UK counterpart Lord Frost, after briefing ambassadors of EU member states. According to an EU source, Mr Barnier is believed to have told them talks over a level playing field remained hard, but were moving towards an agreement. He is also said to have told them a wider deal could fall into place if a route towards an agreement on fishing rights can be identified. But a UK government source later downplayed progress, saying: ""Talks remain difficult and we have not made significant progress in recent days, despite efforts by the UK side to bring energy and ideas to the process."" Lord Frost has said a deal is only possible if it ""fully respects UK sovereignty"". Speaking at an event on Monday, Mrs von der Leyen said the issue of the level playing field was the ""one and only important question"" if UK should continue to have access to the EU's single market. The EU Commission president added: ""They have either to play by our rules, because this is a matter of fairness for our companies... or the other choice is there is a price on it, and the price is border and tariffs."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the continuation of the talks and said the worst outcome would be to ""crash out with no deal whatsoever on 1 January"".

The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. The EU is reported to have dropped the idea of a formal mechanism to ensure both sides keep up with each other's standards and is now prepared to accept UK divergence - provided there are safeguards to prevent unfair competition. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. What does it mean in Brexit trade deal terms ""to go the extra mile""? That's the distance the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, have promised to travel over the next days. But will the road take them to deal or no-deal? And who will compromise on what to get there? EU contacts close to the talks say both sides are being constructive. They insist negotiations aren't simply continuing because neither the EU, nor the government want to be blamed in a no-deal scenario and prefer not to walk away first. Remember: what's said in front of the cameras is only part of the picture. We aren't behind the scenes in the negotiating room or on the closed calls between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen. But however long these talks rumble on, ultimately neither the government, nor the EU, will sign up to a deal if they can't claim it as a victory. Read more from Katya here. The National Farmers' Union has warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. And the British Retail Consortium warned the public would face ""over Â£3bn in food tariffs [meaning] retailers would have no choice but to pass on some of these additional costs to their customers"".

Laura Kuenssberg: Are chances of a trade deal rising again?,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on rather than pull the plug today. A joint statement emerged just before noon with a much more positive tone than anything that's come out of late, and did not feature the usual kind of warning of big gaps between the two sides. The froideur from Thursday and Friday seems to be thawing a little. It's also worth noting no new time limit was put on the talks, although of course there is one hard deadline of 31 December, when the status quo runs out. It's also worth noting that the prime minister was loath to show much sign of optimism when he appeared in front of a camera shortly after the joint statement emerged. PM and EU chief agree to extend Brexit trade talks Live: Reaction to talks continuing Stripping away the spin on both sides, there is little question that the prospects of a deal felt slim at the end of the week. The prime minister moved repeatedly to start warning the public and business that leaving without an agreement felt increasingly likely, unless there was some shift in the EU position. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit negotiations will continue Remember it's not that long ago that a deal had seemed within reach, before some countries started pushing for a more robust approach. It seems now that in the last couple of days the negotiators have taken some small steps back towards that position with suggestions that Brussels has softened its position on how the two sides sort out disputes over common rules in the years to come. There are whispers that they have pulled back from trying to include the ""ratchet clause"",a major UK gripe explained by my colleague Faisal Islam. This was the problem described by Mr Johnson on Thursday using a rather bizarre metaphor about twins. However you describe it, it was clear the UK just wasn't willing to accept that the EU could take punitive action on its own, so the negotiators have been trying to sort out how to fix it together. Indeed one diplomatic source suggested that the ""ratchet clause"" approach had been abandoned some time ago, and the political narratives on both sides have been running behind what's been happening in the negotiating room. The circle around the talks is extremely tight so it is very hard to know precisely what is going on. It is possible that both sides are dangling concessions. One Cabinet minister on the call with the prime minister said even they weren't told about the details of where any movement has been going on. But there is the sense now that the ground has shifted enough to make the chance of a deal worth pursuing. As the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC this morning, there is always the possibility of ""creative contours in the drafting"". In other words - the political imperatives to make this happen are so strong that even tricky issues at this late stage can still potentially be fudged. It's far from certain that the talks will end in agreement, but the chances of resolution are once again on the rise.

What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU,"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

What would change with a no-deal Brexit?,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year.

Who are you allowed to see at Christmas?,"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate.

What would no deal mean for Irelandâs economy?,"The Irish government has been clear that a no trade deal Brexit would cause the country significant economic damage. Forecasts by bodies like the Fiscal Advisory Council suggest that it would reduce growth by 5% - 7% over the next 10 years, compared with a scenario where the UK stayed in the EU. The Central Bank suggests that over the medium term, 100,000 fewer jobs would be created in the economy. The country's agrifood sector would see the biggest impact from no deal. As talks continue on a possible UK-EU trade deal before the 31 December deadline, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a no-deal scenario""would be very bad news for all of us"". Mr Martin added that failure to reach an agreement would represent ""an appalling failure of statecraft"" on both sides. The UK and Ireland are major trading partners and a no-deal Brexit would disrupt that trade through the imposition of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other barriers. It is important to keep this trade relationship in perspective. The UK is not Ireland's biggest export market and has not been for years. Ireland's growth as a manufacturing centre for pharmaceuticals and medical devices has made its exports more globalised. The US is actually the largest external market, taking 28% of all goods exported in 2018. But the UK is number three, after Belgium. What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? In 2018, 11% of Ireland's goods exports, worth â¬16bn (Â£14.7bn), were sold to the UK. About 30% of those exports are in the agrifood sector with chemicals and machinery the next largest sectors. Red meat producers are particularly exposed -about 50% of Ireland's beef exports by value are sold in the UK. These food exports would face steep tariffs in England, Scotland and Wales in the event of no deal (tariff-free trade with Northern Ireland will continue). The Irish Farmers Journal has warned: ""Irish beef producers will have a major problem if there is no trade deal and it will become a problem for the entire EU very quickly."" It said that if Irish beef was effectively priced out of Britain then it would ""inevitably"" flood the EU market. The journal suggested the EU may have to take ""exceptional measures"" as a result perhaps even closing its market to non-EU beef as an interim measure. Damage to the UK trading relationship may also be concentrated among smaller firms. Research by Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO), carried out in 2017, suggested that among large businesses that export, only 1% are solely dependent on the UK market, but for small businesses it is 26%, and among micro-business exporters it is 68%. However, for some of those smaller businesses, their UK exports may only be going to Northern Ireland so will continue to have tariff-free access. But in a no-deal Brexit it seems likely that most of the damage would be to Irish-owned small and medium-sized exporters, particularly in rural areas. Imports also matter: Ireland imported â¬20bn (Â£18.3bn) of goods from the UK in 2018, more than from any other country. In a no-deal, some of these goods would also face tariffs that could increase prices for Irish consumers and input costs for some manufacturers. Exports don't tell the whole story of the UK's importance to Irish trade. Every year about â¬18bn (Â£16.5bn) worth of Irish goods pass through the UK on the way to other EU markets. This route, via the UK road and ports network, is known as the land bridge. It is particularly important for high-value or time-sensitive goods because it offers faster transit times than alternative sea routes. A study by the Irish Maritime Development Office,external, published in 2018, suggested the land-bridge route from Dublin to Calais takes approximately 20 hours, while direct ferry services from Ireland to the continental EU can take twice as long. But even with a deal there are likely to be delays at English Channel ports so there has been a big increase in direct sailings from Ireland to the continent. For example Rosslare Europort, on the south-east coast, will have six sailings a week to both Cherbourg and Dunkirk and twice a week to Bilbao. This will still be a problem for the most time-sensitive products but the new services will at least provide certainty that goods can still move to the wider EU. The Irish government has been preparing for a long time. It has been running information roadshows for businesses, often led by cabinet ministers, since September 2018. Various grant and loans schemes have been made available for companies to pay for professional advice and develop new markets. No-deal Brexit legislationwas passed in February last year creating continuity in areas such as pensions and benefits, cross-border rail services and the all-island single electricity market. New border posts have been built at ports which handle UK trade and hundreds of new staff hired to run them. The Northern Ireland Protocol, a special deal between the EU and UK, keeps the border with Northern Ireland as it is now and solves what was potentially a huge political, security and economic issue for Ireland. But themost recent version of the government's action plan,externalwarns people not to expect plain sailing. ""The scale and interconnectedness of the EU-UK relationship mean we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of disruption,"" it reads. ""Even with all the work that has been done, there will be severe disruption."" SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

What are the quarantine rules for entering the UK?,"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete apassenger locator form,externalbefore departure. Digital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalorNorthern Ireland,external. Test results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish. European Union residents can use theEU Digital Covid Certificateto show their vaccination status or test results.

Many UK familieshave cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islandsbecause children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. Very few countries allow unrestricted access to those who have not been vaccinated. It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world still require all UK travellers to take a pre-departure PCR test before arrival.

Public 'must think carefully' about Christmas risk,"People must think ""really carefully"" about the risk of more social contact over Christmas, NHS bosses have warned. ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" said Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers. But he pointed out that the US saw ""record numbers"" of cases and deaths after the Thanksgiving holiday - and said the NHS was worried about January. The government's Dominic Raab said people needed the five-day relaxation of Covid rules on ""an emotional level"". Meanwhile, the chances of the Oxford University vaccine being rolled out by the end of the year are ""pretty high"", the vaccine's architect Prof Sarah Gilbert has told the BBC. A further 18,447 cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with another 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. UK coronavirus cases up by 21,502 on Saturday Find out the rules where you live Between 23 and 27 December, coronavirus restrictions are being relaxed across the UK, allowing three householdsto form a ""bubble""and mix indoors and stay overnight. But NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - has written to the PM urging him to ""personally lead a better public debate about the risks inherent in the guidance"" - although it stopped short of calling for a review of the rules over Christmas. ""There seems to be a sense at the moment that, 'hey because the government's put these rules down, there's no risk to people having more social contact over Christmas',"" Mr Hopson told BBC Breakfast. ""Of course, part of it is about sticking to the rules but any kind of extra social contact over Christmas - particularly with those who are vulnerable to the virus - actually is very risky."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas, I really don't, but I think everybody needs to think really, really carefully what are they going to do over Christmas,"" he said. ""It's not, 'is what we're going to be doing sticking within the rules?' It's 'how much risk are we going to cause to the people we interact with?'"" The rise in infections in the US after the Thanksgiving holiday was also highlighted by NHS Providers. The NHS is worried about the potential pressure on hospital beds, and its ability to treat all the patients it needs to in December, January and February, Mr Hopson said. ""At the same time you've got rising infections in places like London, Essex, parts of Kent, parts of Lincolnshire,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out any possibility that the government would review the Christmas relaxation of rules. Speaking to Sky News's Sophy Ridge programme on Sunday, he said: ""I think people do need that five-day window over Christmas to spend a bit of time with their loved ones and I think at a mental health level, an emotional level, people do need it."" It comes afterpublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld saidloosening Covid restrictions over Christmas was ""a mistake"". Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said the rules around Christmas could be changed - but it could affect trust in the government. NHS Providers also warned that relaxing Covid rules when they are reviewed in England could trigger a third wave of the virus during the busiest time of year for hospitals. England'sthree-tier systemis due to be reviewed on Wednesday 16 December. It urged the PM against moving any area to a lower tier and said areas should be moved into tier three - the highest level of restrictions -  ""as soon as this is needed, without any delay"". Earlier this week,some health experts called for London to be placed in tier three ""now""after official figures showed Outer London had a higher infection rate than some areas already in the top tier. The government said it ""will not hesitate to take necessary actions to protect local communities"". Decisions on tiers are made by ministers, based on the latest available data and advice from public health experts, a spokesperson added. ""We have introduced strengthened local restrictions to protect the progress gained during national restrictions, reduce pressure on the NHS and ultimately save lives,"" they said. ""On top of our record NHS investment, this winter we are providing an extra Â£3bn to maintain independent sector and Nightingale hospital surge capacity and a further Â£450m to upgrade and expand A&Es."" THREE TIERS:How does the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, Prof Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, was upbeat when asked about the possibility of people receiving the Oxford jab by the end of the year. The vaccine has not yet been approved by the UK's regulator, buta study this week showedit was safe and effective. ""I think the chances are pretty high,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But we do need multiple vaccines, all countries need multiple vaccines, the world needs multiple vaccines and we need vaccines made using different technologies, if that's possible.""

"Wild weather lashes Australia's east coastHeavy rain and huge ocean swells batter popular tourist spots, prompting hundreds of calls for help.","This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay as wild weather batters the country Byron Bay's famous beach has all but disappeared, as extreme weather batters Australia's east coast, officials say. Main Beach - a popular tourist destination - had already been depleted due to previous erosions. But local mayor Simon Richardson said ""severe weather"" and ""massive swells"" were smashing what was left. ""We're watching our beach disappear,"" he said. A 1,000km (620 mile) stretch of coast is being hit with torrential rain and ""abnormally high"" tides. More than 2,000 homes in cities, including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, lost electricity on Monday after strong winds struck power lines. Tides up to 8m (26ft) high were recorded, eroding the shoreline in some areas, including Byron Bay. Emergency services said they had received over 700 calls for help since Sunday. About half a dozen people stranded in floodwaters had been rescued, they added. Meteorologists have warned that this Australian summer will see the impacts of a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones. 'La NiÃ±a' weather event develops in the Pacific Australia warned on future of 'simultaneous' natural disasters The current wild weather has hit popular holiday spots such as the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast in Queensland. In Byron Bay, in the state of New South Wales, pictures showed the beach covered with water and fallen trees. ""We're seeing the largest coastal erosion we've seen in many years, particularly around the Byron Bay area, which is completely changing the entire landscape of the beaches,"" Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steve Pearce told reporters.

Ikea sorry after port disruption delays orders,"Ikea has apologised to customers after facing stock shortages due to the current congestion at UK ports. Angry shoppers complained they faced delays to orders and could not get through on the retailer's helpline. Ports have been hit by surging demand for imports caused by countries reopening after lockdown, Brexit stockpiling and the Christmas rush. Ikea said it made orders for its flat-pack furniture harder to fulfil at a time of ""unprecedented demand"". On Twitter, one angry customer said: ""My order is over a week late and @IKEAUKSupport will not reply to anything or update me on the status of the delivery."" Another said: ""@IKEAUKSupport Still waiting for a response for something broken when I opened my delivery... Been trying to sort this for 16 days and no response at all."" Sales at the Swedish retailer have boomed in lockdown as people spend more on doing up their homes. But a spokeswoman said its supply chain - including the ports where its products are received - had been hit by the effects of Covid-19 and product availability had been impacted. ""These continue to be extraordinary times and we apologise unreservedly forâ¯the inconvenience caused to our customers,"" she added. ""Weâ¯fully understand their frustration and want to assure them that we are working intensively to resolve these challengesâ¯as soon as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Honda pauses production after UK port woes Imports ranging from building materials to toys and fresh food have been held up due to the issues at ports, causing headaches for businesses. Carmaker Honda even had to pause production last week due to a shortage of components. On Saturday, the British Ports Association said the issues were now ""cascading"", with long queues of traffic outside lorry ports becoming increasingly common. Its boss Richard Ballantyne blamed a ""perfect storm"" of surging global container movements, the busy pre-Christmas period and people moving more goods before the UK's Brexit transition ends. ""This is putting pressure on the logistics and storage sectors both in the UK and abroad,"" he said. Some have warned price rises are likely due to the problems. Ryan Clark, director of the Essex-based freight forwarder Westbound Logistics Services, told the BBC last week: ""The increase in freight is either creating more expensive prices for the consumer, or unsustainability for businesses that will be forced to close where the onward price cannot be increased.""

'Alarming' rise in Wales Covid patients,"Aneurin Bevan Health Board said its hospitals faced ""significant pressure"" Coronavirus cases in one part of Wales are increasing at an ""alarming rate"", a health board has said. Aneurin Bevan health board said its hospitals were under ""significant"" pressure due to Covid patient numbers. It had already announced it would behalting outpatient appointments and non-urgent planned surgeryfrom Monday. The stark warning comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales' NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"". On Saturday,the day the number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales, the family of Ted Edwards, 73, from Monmouthshire, said they were ""really concerned"" after hespent more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside the Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran. The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was ""facing high demand"" across the country ""with acute pressure"" around the hospital leading to ""some long delays with patients on our ambulances"". Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Thousands have had Covid vaccine in Wales The health board said: ""The number of Covid positive patients in our communities is increasing at an alarming rate and we need everyone to play their part to ensure our services are available for when our sickest patients need them."" Weekly infection rates across the five south Wales counties the health board covers averaged about 550 cases for every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, Swansea Bay University Health Board tweeted that it now hasnearly 240 Covid-19 patients,externalin its hospitals, with a warning infection rates in its communities were ""exceptionally high"". Speaking about the threat faced by the NHS, Mr Drakeford said unless ""we take all the action we can [not just] as a government, but as a population"", even more restrictions would be ""unavoidable"". ""The huge danger here is that we transform our National Health Service into a national coronavirus service. ""If the numbers continue to go up as they are, then we will end up diverting our staff resources away from all the things that we expect and need them to do, simply to take care of an ever-rising number of people who are so ill with this dreadful disease that they have to be looked after in hospital. ""We need our health service to be able to respond to all those other things that happen in people's lives in Wales. ""If the numbers continue to escalate in the way they are then, even more restrictions straight after Christmas seem to me to be unavoidable,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement.

But Mr Drakeford toldBBC Politics Wales""it was the right thing to open a hospital that was ready to open"". ""Imagine what it would be like in Aneurin Bevan [health board area] if we didn't have all the beds that are available today in the Grange hospital in addition to what is available,"" he added.
