A message of hope at Washington march,"For such a divisive figure, Donald Trump managed to unify hundreds of thousands of Americans at the Women's March on Washington. Moments after Mr Trump was sworn in as the 45th president on Friday, he delivered a thundering speech in which he promised to improve the lives of millions of Americans. A day later, throngs of women, men and children streamed into the same area where he made that pledge, in order to take a stand for gender and racial equality. Though Mr Trump's named was mentioned frequently, the march, which organisers estimate attracted more than half a million, was not only about the new US president. Messages ranged from ""Thank you for making me an activist Trump"" to ""We will not be silenced,"" but the common thread throughout the patchwork of signs was hope. ""It's about solidarity and visualising the resistance,"" said Jonathon Meier, who took a bus from New York. ""And I think it not only helps with the healing process, but it gives me hope for the next four years."" Washington rally leads Trump protests Obama asks: What shall I do now? This video can not be played Washington DC is leading anti-Trump protests around the world. A sea of activists, some clad in knitted,pink ""pussy"" hatsand others draped in American flags, ambled about the National Mall, stopping to catch a glimpse of some of the high-profile speakers and singing along to songs like ""This Little Light of Mine"". Peppered among the many protest signs were images of ovaries and female genitals, a nod to concerns over losing access to birth control and abortion care under a Trump administration. Jellema Stewart, who travelled from Buffalo, New York, said she was marching for her grandmother, who died at age 38 during an illegal abortion in the 1950s. ""I'm here to make sure her voice is heard,"" she said. ""I marched in 2004 for reproductive rights and it's now 2017 and we're still fighting for the same thing."" Ms Stewart also said she was energised by thousands at the rally, insisting that it sends a message to the new president. ""He gave racism a voice again,"" she said of Mr Trump. ""So we have to be louder than the racism and discrimination that came out of this election and show him that we are definitely a force. To show him that we count and we will be watching."" This video can not be played Women's March on Washington: The 'pussyhats' explained All eyes across the world seemed to be watching, not only the march in Washington, but the dozens of other sister marches that took place in more than 60 countries. Aerial images showed thousands massing in so-called ""solidarity marches"" in the UK, Canada, and Australia as well as in US cities including New York, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles. For demonstrator Chrystian Woods, the marches signalled that the US would not be defined by who was in White House. ""It's not about being anti-Trump,"" she explained. ""It's letting the world know that America is more than just that. America is love, inclusiveness and unity and that America is accepting people who are not like us."" ""I believe deeply this country is for all of us,"" said Brooklyn resident Amy Briggs. ""I would have been very dejected yesterday if I wasn't able to be here and experience this solidarity,"" she said as a young female approached her to sign a rainbow flag. The mood was festive among the peaceful protesters, but some were cautious about what comes after the pink hats come off. Leigh Caputo, a Baltimore public school teacher, said she did not want people to think a march was the only solution. ""I'm hopeful that this [march] mobilises people because there's a lot of work to be done,"" said Ms Caputo. In the months leading up to the event, the organisers faced intense scrutiny over claims that the name exploited past African-American movements and catered to white women. Critics on Facebook told white women to ""check their privilege"", leading to heated discussions about racial divisions and what the march could achieve. It is difficult to ignore the fact that 53% of white women did vote for Mr Trump while the female half of more than 90 million eligible voters did not cast a ballot at all.  So what about the sea of white women at the march? Lesley Mansfield, who travelled from Sante Fe, New Mexico, agreed that it was puzzling that so many women voted for Mr Trump. ""It's a reality we have to be aware of,"" she said. ""But being here reminds us that there are people who think like we do - like the majority who voted for Hillary Clinton."" Those sobering statistics did not seem to loom over those in attendance on Saturday, and like the Trump supporters who stood in the same spot 24 hours earlier, they were full of hope for America's future.

How conservatives rated Trump speech,"Donald Trump campaigned on becoming a president unlike any Washington has ever seen. With his inauguration speech, he's already set the tone. Earlier this week, Trump posted a photo of himself sitting at a desk at Mar-a-Largo, a permanent marker hovering over a notepad. ""Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday,"" he tweeted. Trump vows to end 'American carnage' Trump's angry call to arms Full text of Trump's inauguration speech It's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign. ""Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,"" he said at the beginning of his remarks. For some on Twitter, it bore an eerie similarity to the Batman villain Bane's speech in The Dark Night Rises, so much so thatsomeone posted a 10-second mash-up,externalof the two. But such snarky reactions, warnedFox News commentator Guy Benson,external, underestimate how popular his rhetoric is with Trump supporters. ""People panning the speech still don't seem to understand how resonant the 'I will never ignore you' theme has been, and still is,"" he wrote, referencing Trump's many callouts to those who feel left out of American progress. Trump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: ""Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land."" He painted a picture of a broken and damaged country, dotted with rusting-out factories ""like tombstones"", city streets plagued with ""crime and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives,"" and the wealth of the middle class ""ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world"". It was an unusually bleak speech for an inaugural address. Onedemocratic strategist,externalcalled it ""startlingly angry"". Conservatives were more mixed. According toMSNBC host Joe Scarborough,external, the speech was not intended to follow tradition: ""Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address. It was a primal scream aimed at Washington, DC."" AuthorHugh Hewitt called it,external""authentic, determined, almost grim"".He wrote,external, ""I expected more joy, but it cannot be said that POTUS @realDonaldTrump said anything he hasn't said before. He has a plan and it's going to roll out fast."" Others were sceptical of the breadth of those plans. Trump said the country was poised to ""free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow"", as well as ""eradicate from the face of the Earth"" radical Islamic terrorism. WriterBen Shapiro expressed doubt,externalabout Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs. ""These cannot both be true,"" he wrote. Many also noted that it's easy to campaign as an outsider, railing about America's problems, but harder to lead, when one must find solutions. ""After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,"" wroteNoah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine,external. Commentator Mary Katherine Hahn,externalthinks voters aren't interested in sweeping rhetoric. ""I am unabashedly ideological. The country is not. His message is populist & popular. His opponents dismiss that at their political peril."" Pollster Frank Luntz,externalsaid President Trump seemed to pivot, if not in tone then at least in substance: ""President Trump's inaugural speech was the best delivery I've ever seen from him."" A more well-known conservative kept mum on his opinion. When the Washington Post asked George W Bush what he thought of the speech,he merely replied,external, ""Good to see you."" One high-profile Twitter user was an unabashed fan. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted multiple times in favour of Trump's speech.

Papers await Trump's 'My Maggie' meeting,"A number of papers report on this week's meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump. TheSunday Express looks ahead to the prime minister's visit to the White House,external, saying Mr Trump has taken to calling Mrs May ""My Maggie"" and wants America's relationship with Britain to be more special than ever. TheSunday Times says Mrs May will offer Donald Trump a ""grand bargain"",externalon trade and security. The paper predicts she will use her meeting with the President to kick-start talks on a free trade deal - in exchange for British help to force Nato countries to pay for their own defence. The talks, says the Sunday Telegraph, come as both the US and Britain are seeking to redefine their roles,externalin the world. It predicts that deals are in the offing on banking, trade and defence and claims Mr Trump is keen to recreate the closeness of the Reagan-Thatcher relationship. TheMail on Sunday describes says the summit as a massive diplomatic coup,externalfor the prime minister - she is expected to be the first world leader to meet President Trump. But it adds that Mrs May has made it clear that she will not shrink from challenging his offensive remarks about women and race. There is also coverage of Saturday's protest marches against President Trump. TheObserver says hundreds of thousands of women turned Washington's National Mall into a sea of pink,external, a day after his inauguration. TheSunday Mirror adds that stars,externalincluding Katy Perry, Scarlet Johansson, Emma Watson and Charlize Theron were among the women joining the protests. Writing in the paper,external, the actress Juliet Stevenson compares those marching to the Suffragettes - and says women all round the world are coming together to say ""enough is enough"". Staying with the new US president,the Sun on Sunday assesses Donald Trump's first 24 hours.,externalIts Washington correspondent says he waltzed straight from the dance floor to business - and that after dancing at the inaugural balls he set to work on rolling back his predecessor's policies. In its editorial, theSunday People,externalsays Mr Trump does not sound like a world leader who values peace and harmony in the world. But theMail on Sunday,externalsays with Mr Trump now in the White House, street protests and a silly refusal to accept the result is the worst possible response. Elsewhere,senior Labour sources have told the Sunday People that they fear defeat for the party in two by-elections,externalnext month could spell the end of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The paper says Labour's slim majorities in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland are both under threat on 23 February. In theSunday Telegraph UKIP leader Paul Nuttall, has written an article in which he accuses the Labour Party,externalof betraying the English working class. Mr Nuttall - who will be the party's candidate in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election - says Jeremy Corbyn and his front-benchers are people who appear to ""despise"" the idea of English national identity. TheObserver reports on the gathering of right-wing leaders in the German city of Koblenz,external. Its says the politicians from France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are hoping to capitalise on the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump. TheSunday Times carries has news which will shock bibliophiles,external. It reports on research which suggests that one in 10 people does not own a single book. For those aged 18 to 24, the figure rises to one in five. The paper tries to reassure book lovers by pointing out that another survey - carried out two years ago - found that the average home contains 158 books - although the research found a quarter of them had never been opened. Finally, theMail on Sunday reports on the arrival of ""delicious"" new English sparkling wine it calls ""Liz's fizz"",external.

Berlin unimpressed by UK's Brexit message21 January 2017 (20:44:00),"Two British officials failed to win favour from German business leaders in Berlin The distinguished audience members were too polite to heckle. But the eye rolling, frowns and audible tutting made it quite clear how the Brexiteers' message was going down with German business leaders. Owen Paterson, a former minister and Conservative MP, and John Longworth, co-chair of Leave Means Leave, came to Berlin on Saturday with a clear mission - to persuade German business leaders to lobby Chancellor Angela Merkel to give Britain a good trade deal. They should have been on safe territory. The two men are confident, witty speakers with impressive business and free-trade credentials. Mr Longworth is a former head of the British Chamber of Commerce. Mr Paterson's years spent trading in Germany meant he could open his address with a few remarks in German - which drew an appreciative round of applause - and a well-judged joke about multilingual trade. But it turned out they had entered the lion's den. Brexiteers in warning to German business Lagarde warns UK of pain ahead as Brexit approaches May: UK will lead world on free trade The laughter from the audience quickly turned to sniggers as they heard the UK described as ""a beacon of open, free trade around the world"". Westminster's decision to leave the world's largest free trade area does not look like that to Germany. When Europe was blamed for spending cuts and a lack of British health care provision, there were audible mutters of irritation from the audience. The occasional light-hearted attempts at EU-bashing - usually guaranteed to get a cheap laugh with some British audiences - was met with stony silence. Brexiteers argue German manufacturers will want to still sell to UK customers In another setting - at another time - this gathering of the elite of Germany's powerful business community would have lapped up the British wit. Every ironic quip would ordinarily have had them rolling in the aisles. But British charm does not travel well these days. Rattled by the economic havoc Brexit could unleash, Germans are not in the mood for gags. Britain used to be seen by continentals as quirky and occasionally awkward - but reliably pragmatic on the economy. However, since the Brexit vote, Europeans suspect endearing eccentricity has morphed into unpredictable irrationality. The UK has become the tipsy, tweedy uncle, who after too much Christmas sherry has tipped over into drunkenly abusive bore. When the audience was asked how many of them welcomed Brexit, only one hand went up - and it turned out that belonged to a businessman who wanted more EU reform and was fed up with Britain slowing things down. Brexiteer rhetoric over the past year has often focused on the size of Britain's market and how keen German manufacturers are to sell to British customers. Many leave campaigners remain convinced that German business leaders will force Mrs Merkel to grant the UK a special free trade deal in order not to lose British trade. But that's not what's happening. Angela Merkel has said Britain will not be able to cherry-pick the best bits of the single market Instead German firms are remarkably united in their support of the chancellor in her rejection of British ""cherry-picking"" - even if it means losing business in the short-term. When you talk to German bosses they say their top priority is in fact the integrity of the single market, rather than hanging on to British customers. That's because their supply chains span across the EU. A German car might be designed in Germany, manufactured in Britain, with components made in various parts of eastern Europe, to be sold in France. This only works if there are no cross-border tariffs, paperwork or red tape. German companies - more often family-owned and with deeper connections to their regional heartlands - tend to look at the wider picture, sometimes thinking more long-term. They supported Mrs Merkel on sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, even though that meant a blow to trade. The financial hit was deemed less bad for business than worsening unrest in nearby Ukraine. The same calculations are being made over Brexit. Theresa May's speech on Brexit last week made front page news in Germany This doesn't mean German business is thinking politically, and not economically. But rather, it indicates a wider attitude towards how business can thrive long-term. German business leaders tell you that the British market may be important. But it is only one market, compared to 27 markets in the rest of the EU. Leave campaigners also still underestimate the political and historical significance of the EU for Germany, where it is seen as the guarantor of peace after centuries of warfare. It is tempting to see the clashes between Westminster and the EU27 as one big decades-long misunderstanding of what the EU is. An idealistic peace-project versus a pragmatic free-trade zone. This makes it even more ironic that London may reject the free-trade area it spent so much time creating. Germany was shocked and saddened by the UK's vote to leave the EU. But the decision was quickly accepted in Berlin. ""The Brits never really wanted to be members of the European Union anyway,"" is something you often hear these days. Many Germans now want to just work out a solution that does the least amount of harm to the European economy. Hence the irritation in Germany when British politicians keep rehashing the pre-referendum debate. ""It was frustrating to hear the same old arguments from the referendum campaign,"" one business leader told me when I asked him what he had thought about Saturday's discussion. Germany has moved on, he said. Maybe Britain should too. The Brexiteers might not have persuaded their audience in Berlin. But if they return to London with a better idea of the mood in Germany's business community, then the trip may well have been worthwhile.

Peter Taylor: Martin McGuinness - end of a long journey20 January 2017 (17:50:00),"The political retirement of Martin McGuinness on Thursday due to ill health marks the end of a remarkable journey. Perceived by some as a terrorist, others as a freedom fighter, he ended up a statesman, a journey similar to those previously made by other historical figures from Menachem Begin to Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson Mandela. It also marks the closing of a chapter in Northern Ireland's turbulent history in which Mr McGuinness played a crucial role both as perhaps the most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland and one of its most skilled and charismatic politicians. Without his endeavours, in umbilical political partnership with his former comrade-in- arms, Gerry Adams, I doubt if Northern Ireland, despite the continuing fragility of its institutions, would be where it is today. I first met Martin McGuinness 45 years ago this month, shortly after the day that became notorious as Bloody Sunday when British paratroops shot dead 13 civil rights marchers in the Bogside enclave of Londonderry/Derry. I remember watching a candle-lit procession on its way to the church where the coffins of the dead were lying and being told by the nationalist politician, John Hume, to keep an eye on one of the mourners. He pointed to Martin McGuinness. I followed his advice and soon met him on the steps of the gasworks that served as the IRA's headquarters in the Bogside. At the time he was second in command of the IRA's Derry Brigade. He was soon to become its commander. Martin McGuinness with Gerry Adams, 1987 He did not fit the stereotypical role of an IRA commander at the time. He was personable, highly articulate and utterly committed to his cause of getting the ""Brits"" out of the North. A few months later, following an IRA ceasefire, he was sitting down in a posh house in Chelsea, along with Gerry Adams, as part of the IRA delegation that met the Northern Ireland Secretary, Willie Whitelaw. The IRA said it wanted a British withdrawal by 1975. Not surprisingly, the talks got nowhere and it was back to the ""war"". If anyone had looked into a crystal ball at that time and told me that the young IRA commander would go on to become Northern Ireland's deputy prime minister, sharing power and joking, as ""the chuckle brothers"" with his former arch enemy, Ian Paisley, and then would don white tie and tails to dine with the Queen at Windsor Castle, I would have said that pigs might fly. But pigs did. ""The chuckle brothers"" - Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness at the Northern Ireland Assembly, 2007 Mr McGuinness's role was critical in persuading the IRA's rank-and-file that ""armed struggle"" had run its course and the future road to Sinn Fein's holy grail of a united Ireland lay in sharing power at Stormont with its unionist opponents. This was tantamount to accepting partition (the division of Ireland in 1922 into two states) and the role of the British state - albeit, as far as Sinn Fein is concerned, a temporary accommodation as a means to an end. Remarkably Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness finally persuaded the majority of the IRA to swallow the political heresy and agree to the ceasefire of 1994 that was to lead on to the Good Friday Agreement four years later. A measure of the faith and trust that rank-and-file IRA men and women had in Martin McGuinness is reflected in the sentiment I heard from many of them that ""if it's good enough for Martin, it's good enough for us"". Such sentiments speak volumes of Mr McGuinness and the esteem in which he was held as IRA leader. These landmark steps were only made possible as a result of a protracted and fraught secret back-channel dialogue, via an intermediary, between MI6 and MI5 in which Mr McGuinness was the key conduit to the IRA's ruling Army Council. Martin McGuinness leaves Stormont after resigning earlier this month But Mr McGuinness, because of his IRA past, remains a controversial figure. There are still some Unionists who would take issue withthe tribute paid by Ian Paisley's sonwho said that by working with his father, Martin McGuinness had ""saved lives"" and ""made countless lives better"". His critics can only see him as the former leader of a terrorist organisation responsible for a grievous toll of death and destruction. They will never forget - or forgive the IRA - for the lives of the hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians murdered in the IRA's campaign and the number of families who have been left bereft. But for me, the true recognition of the journey Mr McGuinness has made came in an interview I did with the mother of Marie Wilson, the young woman who died in the IRA's bomb attack on the Remembrance Day parade in Enniskillen in 1987. The intelligence services believe that Martin McGuinness, although he denies it, was at that time the acting head of the IRA's Northern Command that prosecuted the ""war"" in the North. In words of moving candour, Mrs Wilson said she respected Mr McGuinness's role in helping to bring the conflict to end and making such attacks, she hoped, a thing of the past.

Women's March,"(l-r) Sophie Pegg, Jasmine Graham, Nancy Pegg, Shamira Graham joined the Women's March in London ""Stand united, we will never be divided,"" was the message chanted by the crowd as people marched through central London. Cheers erupted every few minutes as the crowd held up placards to the beat of drum and bass music from a portable sound system. ""Girls just wanna have fundamental rights"", ""Women won't be trumped"" and ""Burn bras not bridges"" were some of the messages directed at US President Donald Trump from the UK. Women - and men - of all ages descended on the capital for the Women's March in London on the first full day of his presidency. There was a united message from the crowd, who came with glitter on their faces and even fancy dress to take part in the two-mile walk. Many were parents who said they wanted to send out a message for the next generation that they have a voice and can stand up for the women's rights they believe to be under threat from the new US administration. Danae Savvidou said she had attended the march for her 10-month-old daughter Mum-of-one Danae Savvidou, 25, travelled alone from Gloucestershire to London to take part in the event for the sake of her 10-month-old daughter. She said: ""She was born during the presidency of a man who openly supported women's rights and protected them. ""I feel like we've gone back 100 years and I feel sad for her generation. ""Donald Trump isn't presidential material. He's openly misogynistic and racist as well. I see America as a leader and partners in the Western world. He represents such a big nation. ""Our leaders over here are right wing as well. It's not going the right way for me. ""Brexit is a concern. I hope we protect the rights the EU offers, such as employment rights and maternity. These issues need to be spoken about. When a nation is doing badly, women suffer. ""Personally I want my daughter to see what I've done today to show you can do things to change the world and she does have the power."" It was a message which resonated with many other parents as they walked with their children in the fresh winter's air along Piccadilly. The march had many parents attending with their children Nancy Pegg, 39, a mum-of-two from south-west London, came along with her daughter Sophie, nine, who carried a yellow banner emblazoned with the words ""Yes to equality"". She said: ""This is about equality for girls not in a fortunate position. ""Trump is a concern but empowering women is the main motivation. I think it's important for my daughter to have a powerful voice and to know she can be a strong force. ""We live in a male-dominated world. I want to show her anything her brother can do, she can do too. There are no boundaries."" Although the event was labelled a Women's March, there were hundreds of men in the crowd showing their support. Car horns beeped to galvanise the demonstrators who, in turn, greeted the drivers with cheers as the march progressed to its rally in Trafalgar Square. The Raise Voices Choir motivated the protesters by singing ""Don't let Trump get his way"" to their own version of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"". Patrick Bone (l) and his friend Twyla Doone Student Patrick Bone, from Shepherd's Bush, London, attended because he felt ""progress made in the last decades is in threat of being eroded"". He added: ""Trump's election signalled a rise of the populist right who look to blame economic problems on minorities or disenfranchised groups. ""His election was a catalyst for something that's been coming a long time. ""This march is to show we will stand and be counted. This is only the beginning. The work begins today."" Tom Amies, 33, a doctor from Middlesex, walked beside his wife Lydia, 34, as he carried their 11-month-old daughter Niamh in a baby carrier sling. ""This is for my daughter, he said. ""There has been a political slide to the right and a sense of misplaced trust. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. It shows how good we have it with the NHS. ""There are going to be people there who have that healthcare for life-saving treatment and they will no longer be able to afford it."" Lydia Amie, husband Tom and daughter Niamh attended the march as a family The demonstration brought representatives from all nationalities, including Americans who felt they needed to take a stand even though they were thousands of miles away from their country. Retired banker Carol Moore, 68, originally from New York, came to represent the Democrats Abroad UK Women's Caucus. She said: ""I've come because of the horror of seeing Donald Trump win. He is divisive and will hurt the middle classes by repealing the healthcare act. ""This march has taken on huge visibility here in the UK because the issues are global. Women's pay was an issue when I worked in the City. ""There is still the issue of sexual violence and how it's prosecuted and handled here.

Red button,"A hug, a dance and a song is hardly the reaction you would expect from someone just about to be declared bankrupt. The threat of losing your home, a year of financial restrictions, three years of paying creditors, and a six-year blight on your credit rating does not generally prompt a musical routine. Yet the relief of facing up to, and striking out, unmanageable debts can lead to such a response, according to debt charities. In this case, it was a man called Stephen, who submitted his bankruptcy form, hugged a debt counsellor, and danced around their office. Now the perceived stigma of bankruptcy has also been diluted, according to the Insolvency Service. Anew system in England and Wales means applications are made online,external, without the need to go to court. ""Going to County Court with 30 pages of paperwork in triplicate was a huge, daunting challenge under the old system,"" says Mark Cowley, insolvency manager at debt charity Christians Against Poverty. ""There was a psychological effect in going to court. Many people assumed it was criminal although it is a civil procedure."" Figures suggest that the new clickable application, and its lower fee, has increased the numbers choosing bankruptcy. So, is this a simple matter of convenience or is it actually the result of more people facing unmanageable debt as wages are squeezed and prices rise? Financial difficulties can be extremely stressful (picture posed by a model) Shirley, from Basildon in Essex, had debts of more than Â£40,000. After attempting suicide, she was referred to Christians Against Poverty debt counsellors by her local housing association. The charity says it would have taken her more than 20 years to repay the debts, so she applied for bankruptcy with a counsellor's help. ""I suffer with anxiety, and when I get stressed I get blackouts,"" she says. ""The thought of going to court for bankruptcy was a bit scary, I didn't like that idea. My debt coach told me I wouldn't need to go. Filling in the form online made it a lot easier. It took away the stress. I did have some help from my support worker because I'm dyslexic, but it was very easy. It was all really quick."" Now, after setting up a savings plan with the charity, she is Â£63 in credit. ""I've never been in credit that much before,"" she says. Liz Thomas is The Adjudicator at the Insolvency Service for England and Wales There are a variety of ways that someone with out-of-control debts can deal with the situation by going insolvent. Bankruptcy is only one of those options, yet it is the most recognised. The threat of losing your home, the public admission of money troubles, and that trip to court have all created the stigma that has been attached to bankruptcy - even though, for some, it is clearly their best option. The shift from court to internet, introduced in April and the biggest change to bankruptcy rules for 30 years, was in part an attempt to eliminate that perceived shame. ""It was a real barrier for some people,"" says Liz Thomas, The Adjudicator at the Insolvency Service for England and Wales. ""We now have a simpler form, we have ensured the questions were understood, and people are able to complete it in their own time. ""It is still lengthy. It takes several hours to fill in, and there is information to ensure people understand the seriousness of what they are doing."" But now, after pressing the submit button, some 95% of ""successful"" applicants are declared bankrupt within two working days. Bankruptcy:The traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt. Ends after one year, but there is a possibility you may lose your assets, including your house, to pay something to the creditors. Since April, applications can be made online and considered by an adjudicator. Costs Â£680 Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA):A deal between you and your creditors, overseen by an insolvency practitioner. Less chance of losing your home, but involves paying some of your debts in one go Debt Relief Orders:Introduced in April 2009, these allow people with debts of less than Â£15,000 (Â£20,000 since October 2015) and minimal assets to write off debts without a full-blown bankruptcy The new online system - unlike some more high-profile government IT projects - was on time and it worked. It remains exposed to the same frailties as any other online service. On Thursday, it was unavailable for several hours owing to a fault. Still, the effect of the new system is starting to show, according to the Insolvency Service. The number of individuals declaring themselves bankrupt rose by 7% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier. The full set of 2016 figures will be published on Friday. Having assisted many people to complete bankruptcy applications, debt charities have broadly welcomed the online form. ""The roll-out date was optimistic, but the project has worked. The name 'bankruptcy' still spooks people, but it has taken the stigma out of it to some degree,"" says Mr Cowley, of Christians Against Poverty. Ironically, 90% of users say they would recommend the system to family or friends. A recommendation, no doubt, that they would rather not have to take up. Mark Cowley says bankruptcy is the best route for some people in serious debt The upfront application fee is also cheaper. Under the old system, it cost more than Â£700; now, as there is no need for court fees, it costs Â£680. That is clearer, charities say, but not necessarily better - or ultimately cheaper - for the poorest applicants. Under the old system, a court could waive its fee of about Â£150 for the most vulnerable. That discount, or an equivalent, is no longer available. In its place is a system allowing people to pay the Â£680 fee in instalments. That fee, says Liz Thomas, will cover the cost of developing the new system within five years, at no cost to the public purse. In Scotland, insolvency works very differently to England and Wales. The equivalent to the Insolvency Service is the AIB (Accountant in Bankruptcy). The AIB functions like a court. Those seeking bankruptcy can apply online but not on their own. They have to have received advice from an approved money adviser or insolvency practitioner before applying. In Northern Ireland, all bankruptcies are made through the courts.

Insolvencies are at historically low levels putting relatively little pressure on the system, but there are signs that the red alert is starting to return. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has frequently taken the opportunity to express concern about the level of household debt. Borrowing on credit cards and unsecured debts such as overdrafts is rising at its fastest rate for a decade - a trend that he says requires the bank's ""vigilance"". Rising unsecured debt should not be a problem when interest rates are low - as they are - and wages are rising. Yet it does leave households exposed to a financial shock if jobs are lost or interest charges rise. So, there is some concern that default rates on this unsecured debt increased in the final three months of 2016, according to the Bank of England's Credit Conditions Survey. The following graph also reveals that UK households are funding their spending by dipping into their savings. This was happening at its fastest rate for two years in the third quarter of 2016, according to the latest official statistics. A saving ratio of below zero basically means households are not saving, but are spending more than their disposable income. It was negative from the start of 2004 until the latter end of 2008. The Office for National Statistics says a fall in the saving ratio may be an indication that households are more confident and spending more, rather than desperately ducking into their savings. Analysts Capital Economics also notes that there is no need to panic over household debts. The cost of servicing debts compared to household income is still low and manageable, it says. Interest rates would have to rise significantly to raise this cost to the levels seen in 2008. No crisis in household debt means no glut of bankruptcies. Still, there will always be people whose debts spiral out of control - and, for them, applying for bankruptcy has got a little bit easier.

Bulls and bullying,"Tamil actress Trisha Krishnan deleted her Twitter account as a result of a row over bull-taming A ban on the ancient practice of bull-taming has spurred thousands to protest in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. While the demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, the argument over the festival has turned ugly online. This week around 4,000 protesterscamped out on a beach in the state's capital, Chennai (Madras) - with hundreds more gathering in other parts of the state. The crowd, who are mostly students, are against India's ban on Jallikattu, a 2,000 year old bull-taming tradition, which takes place as part of an annual harvest festival. Bull-taming involves men chasing and removing prizes tied to the bull's horns. Animal rights activists argue it's abusive and results in mistreatment of the animals,but protesters contend the practice central to Tamil identity and that the bulls are rarely harmed or killed. The men participating in Jallikattu attempt to grab prizes attached to the bull's horns Jallikattu was banned by India's supreme court in 2014, a ruling that was upheld in 2016. The lawsuit that led to the ban was filed by animal rights groups including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). And as protests against the ban have spread, PETA activists and supporters have found themselves targeted on social media. ""I have been threatened with rape I'm called all sorts of names which I can't repeat,"" says Poorva Joshipura, CEO of PETA India. ""The general public are being incited and influenced through lies and online bullying and fake news which has unfortunately become so common in our world today,"" Joshipura tells BBC Trending radio. She takes particular issue with memes containing false personal information which have been shared online. ""One is a picture of me wearing my vegan boots (footwear made without leather or any animal ingredients), boots that I really like a lot. The meme falsely says that the boots are made of leather,"" Joshipura says. ""I have been campaigning against the leather industry for years."" Hear more on this storyon the BBC World Service. The Indian film actress Trisha Krishnan has also been caught up in the debate. In 2010, Krishnan worked on a PETA campaign. Reports on social media suggested that she had tweeted, and then deleted, her support of a Jallikattu ban. One of the social media posts spreading about the actress was a fake obituary claiming she had died of HIV. The faked obituary poster of Trisha Krishnan lists cause of death as ""HIV affected"" - insinuating that the actress is sexually promiscuous. It also calls her father a ""poramboku"" (wastrel) and her mother a ""peethasirukki"" (boastful woman). In response, Krishnan first denied that she supported the ban and later deactivated her Twitter account, releasing a statement saying: ""I'm a proud Tamilian by birth and I believe and respect the Tamil culture and tradition and I will never go against the sentiments of my own people who have been instrumental in my growth and stature."" Krishnan declined a request by BBC Trending for an interview. Her spokesperson told us that ""PETA and Trisha are separate"", stressing that the actress had only collaborated with the group on one campaign. Bull tamers must hold on to the animal's hump for about 15-20 metres or three jumps of the bull to win a prize Krishnan wasn't the only high profile person targeted on social media. The actorVishal,externalalso received online backlash for being a supporter of PETA, and subsequently deactivated his Twitter profile. False allegations that the PETA India CEO Poorva Joshipura wears leather boots have been circulating online The pictures and rumours have been spread by groups such asChennai Memes,external, a politically active viral marketing agency which made up the leather boots rumour about Poorva Joshipura. Gautam Govindaram, one of the founders of Chennai Memes, defended the group's decision in creating the meme, telling BBC Trending: ""I'm sure she has at least one product that is made of leather. She can't say that she has never used any product in her lifetime that has not been made of leather. I can be 100% sure I mean if she's born and she's one year old or two years old she must have come across with something made of leather."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external Operating primarily on Facebook, Chennai Memes create around 20 memes a day, often referencing local and national political and social issues. The group were cited by local media as being key to galvanising and mobilising the youth-led protests over the Jallikattu ban - creating shareable posters and spreading information on dates and timings of events through their Facebook page, which has more than 600,000 fans. Govindaram added that the group was not behind the memes targeting the actress Trisha Krishnan. ""It's not exactly only us, it's the entire people here in the state of Tamil Nadu who are making a stand,"" he says. ""Why should an organisation from another country come here, tell us about our traditions and why do they have the government of India in the palm of their hand?"" A number of villages in Tamil Nadu are reported to have defied the Jallikattu ban and held bull-taming events this week. And other prominent South Indian film stars, like Rajinikant and Kamal Haasan, have expressed their support of the sport.

Did ye get healed?,"I have a special connection to an enigmatic Belfast man whose music crosses jazz, blues, folk and rock. In the late 1980s, I was held hostage in Beirut. Of my five years in captivity, four were spent with the Irish writer Brian Keenan. Stripped of virtually all external stimuli, we had to keep our minds and hearts going with memories. Two lonely men, we shared things that had touched us - books, films and music. Our soundscape then was as blank and depressing as the concrete walls of our cells.  But music would emerge from our memories and we would hum snatches of songs as they came to us. Brian talked of traditional Irish music and of the great Belfast musician Van Morrison. I had never seen Morrison in concert but knew some of his hits - Brown Eyed Girl, Gloria and Moondance. But as Brian spoke, I somehow I felt as though I had stood with him in a crowded Belfast concert hall watching Morrison leaning into the microphone as he sang one of his soulful ballads - or throwing himself about the stage like a wild man, overwhelmed by the power of the music. Morrison is only a few years older than Brian and was born only a few streets away in East Belfast. They went to the same school and came from the same modest backgrounds. Morrison's father had been a shipyard worker and they had grown up in near identical, small terraced houses. However, only a short walk away, was another world, a street lined with large villas called Cyprus Avenue. Morrison wrote about it on a track on his seminal album, Astral Weeks. Brian took me to these streets for the first time to record a BBC radio documentary, Van Morrison and Me. Two years ago, Morrison played a concert on Cyprus Avenue which Brian attended. He dedicated the song ""Motherless Child"" to Brian, something he has never forgotten and which deeply moved him. ""It's a song which has a very special significance for me. Chained to a wall, never knowing if you were ever getting out, ever going home, your whole sense of who you were evaporated. And you felt lost and lonely, a bit like a motherless child,"" Brian said. When I was finally released in 1991, I strove to come to terms with what had happened with the help of my girlfriend Jill Morrell, who had been campaigning constantly for my release. We settled in a cottage in the Oxfordshire countryside and Morrison's music became a key part of our liberation soundtrack. John McCarthy (left) and Brian Keenan on Belfast's Cyprus Avenue Jill and I tried to make sense of those extraordinary times, writing a memoir of my captivity and her campaign. One song particularly touched us both, and that was Wonderful Remark. I remember one night getting a magnifying glass to read the lyrics crammed onto the cassette's sleeve notes. As I read, I was stunned. Morrison's words seemed to capture the emotional heart of our experience over the hostage years: ""How can you stand the silence, that pervades when we all cry? How can you watch the violence that erupts before your eyes?"" How did he come to write that? I had met Morrison once or twice since my release at charity events and hoped that personal connection might help persuade him to speak to me about his music. So I was delighted when he agreed to meet me at the Culloden Hotel, a beautiful former bishop's palace on the outskirts of Belfast. When I asked him about Wonderful Remark, he told me that it was a song about hard times he had suffered in New York. He was short of money and felt stranded, a situation which contrasts to mine. But we both experienced similar feelings of frustration and sadness, as Morrison explained: ""It was a song about my circumstances but it was nothing compared to what you've been through. It was about people who were supposed to be helping you and they weren't there. ""It was about the business I'm in and the world in general. A lot of the times you can't count on anybody."" John McCarthy and Brain Keenan by Belfast's Beachie River Brian took me from Cyprus Avenue to other locations which feature in Morrison's songs. Hyndford Street, where Morrison grew up and the nearby Beachie River. Brian told me he used to go there as a boy with his father: ""If we missed school, we'd go round there and catch frogs and newts. And it was a place where you could go courting where nobody could see what you were up to."" John McCarthy and Brian Keenan next to a mural celebrating Belfast's most famous musician John McCarthy (right) and author Ian Rankin Ian Rankin is another writer who says he has been influenced by Morrison's music at an important moment in his life. In his mid-20s he was living in London, frustrated that he was not making progress as an author. He told me how, after suffering panic attacks, his doctor advised him to rest. So he grabbed a handful of Van Morrison cassettes and caught a train up to Scarborough to reflect on his life. ""It's very personal music and I thought here's someone who understands something of what I'm going through, they've seen highs and lows,"" he said. While Wonderful Remark is the stand-out Morrison song for me, Ian was most influenced at the time by tracks from Morrison's 1973 album Hard Nose the Highway: ""What I learnt was something about ploughing your own furrow. Don't let the world get in the way, if you want to be a writer, be a writer."" Ian decided to move to France to concentrate on writing novels. He has since written 21 Inspector Rebus books and become a world-famous author. Van Morrison - Sir Van Morrison now - is rightly regarded as one of the truly original songwriters and performers of his generation. His official accolades include two Grammys and an Ivor Novello award. One song - Someone Like You - has appeared in no less than seven Hollywood movies. But the real accolades are from the millions of people, like me, who have, time and time again, been moved by his songs. When I asked him how he had managed to touch so many people's lives, he said it was about working with the natural talent with which he had been born. ""I think it comes from God, whatever that concept is. A lot of people are given gifts and they don't develop them. I thought because I was given this gift, I had to develop it.""

Chapecoense return,"This video can not be played Chapecoense survivor saw crash in dream Sirli Freitas took one, final phone call from her husband Cleberson Silva before he had to switch off his phone. ""There was so much background noise,"" she said. ""So much laughter and fun. ""I said, 'are you really on a plane, or in a bar?'"" Journalist Silva was on a plane that went down in the Andes on 29 November. He was one of 71 people who died along with almost the entire Chapecoense football team. The players were en route to the biggest match in the club's 43-year history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Colombia's Atletico Nacional. On Saturday, Chapecoense will play their first match since the crash - a friendly against defending Brazilian league champions Palmeiras. The people of Chapeco will, once-again, fill the small Arena Conda to see some of the 22 new players who make up the squad. Three of the six survivors were players, including central defender Neto, who was one of the team's leaders. He lay for six hours, trapped beneath the fuselage and trees, before being the last to be pulled out. Remarkably, he's already started walking without crutches. Sirli Freitas' husband died in the Andes plane crash ""I remember the lights went out suddenly, then I started praying, asking God to help us,"" he said. ""But a lot of people thought the plane was just landing, because it was not an abrupt fall. ""I remember the moment that I couldn't hear the plane engine anymore. It was just the wind, and then an alarm. ""But no-one got desperate, there was a lot of people praying. These are the last memories I have."" When Neto woke up in hospital, he was told he had been injured in the match because nobody knew quite how to break the news to him. But the truth dawned on him when there were no video clips of the match or evidence of his injury. Chapeco is a quiet, unassuming city with an air of settled contentment. Its population of about 209,553 is only slightly higher than the number of people who crammed into the Maracana Stadium to watch the 1950 World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil. But they form a tight-knit community, and a major part of that is the Chapecoense football team. Chapecoense plane crash timeline 29 November 2016:Chapecoense team in plane crash 3 December 2016:Fans unite for stadium memorial 5 December 2016:Team awarded Copa Sudamericana 26 December 2016:Colombia blames human error Club flags and signs adorn shops and bars all over the city. The relationship between citizens and club is one of mutual and humble respect and affection, according to 41-year-old Karina Dini. ""It was a strong bond, we were all a family,"" she said, sitting in the office of the language school she runs with her husband. ""There weren't any players who were going to parties or anything. Most of them were very committed. We could meet them in restaurants or the supermarket. ""It was amazing because players from the first division don't get that contact with people. They have big cars, they can't talk to people."" Like Karina, whose husband's uncle died in the crash, most people here know someone who was on the plane, or someone, like Sirli Freitas, who's been affected directly. ""My eight-year-old son understands [what happened], but his sister, who's three, still asks for her dad even though she knows he's not here any more,"" she said, through tears. ""If you ask her about him, she says that he was on the plane that crashed, but but at other times she'll say, 'let's call daddy'."" Outside the Arena Conda, there's a message to the world: ""We were looking for a word to say thanks for all the love we've received, and we found several."" Around the stadium, the streets have been painted green and white, in the club's colours. There has been a steady procession of press conferences, introducing some of the 22 new players. Rui Costa was brought in from Brazilian club Gremio and made director of football a week after the tragedy. This video can not be played Chapecoense: The day football wept Costa is adamant that Saturday's match is far more than a friendly. ""When I got here we had four players and a devastated dressing room. It was all about sadness and silence,"" he said. ""A dressing room should never be silent and here, it was. So we have accomplished our first goal - you can see a football team training here."" ""We had a list with 90 names that we were interested in,"" he said, as he explained how he assembled the squad in less than two months. ""We were choosing based on technical characteristics, then behaviour, then salary. ""We were working almost 24 hours a day because we knew it was not about just putting them on the pitch to play together. ""We had to respect the culture of the club. That's what they hired me for."" The last time the people of Chapeco went to the Arena Conda, it was on a day of torrential rain, to receive the bodies of their players, directors and journalists. On Saturday, they will return, to honour the city's fallen, and to meet their new family.

O'Sullivan reaches 12th Masters final,"This video can not be played Best five shots as O'Sullivan reaches final Dafabet Masters 2017 - final Venue:Alexandra Palace, LondonDate:Sunday, 22 January Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, Connected TV, Red Button, BBC Sport website and app from 13:00 GMT Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan overcame a split cue tip to reach his 12th Masters final with a 6-4 win over Marco Fu at Alexandra Palace in London. Fu hit 110 to lead 2-1 before O'Sullivan needed to repair his cue. The next four frames were shared with O'Sullivan knocking in breaks of 95 and 122 while Hong Kong's Fu hit 141, the highest of the tournament, and 89. O'Sullivan won the last three frames and will playJoe Perryin Sunday's final after he beat Barry Hawkins 6-5. ""It is probably the best match I have won, given the circumstances,"" O'Sullivan told BBC Sport. ""The tip was gone, completely gone. It just couldn't take any chalk. I mis-cued five or six times. It was like chalking a bit of slate. ""I was going to wait for the interval but it was so gone and they said 'look, you can take the interval now' and that was sweet."" This video can not be played Fu fires in a 141 break against O'Sullivan The interval normally comes after four frames, but tournament officials allowed the Englishman to fix his cue after frame three. ""I had my cue tip over a kettle because the steam softens it up but it had no effect. I just could not play any shots, I had no touch or feel, so I had to put a new tip on. I was lucky it was a decent tip,"" he said. The new tip seemed to galvanise him as he made frame-winning contributions at every opportunity following the interval, knocking in four half centuries in the last three frames. ""If you're playing well you can get away with a new tip. If you're cueing badly and you put a new tip on, it's over,"" said O'Sullivan. ""I fancied the job. Even with a new tip. I thought 'if I can get a feel of it'."" Fu, runner-up in 2011, added: ""It is better to lose like this than for me to collapse and miss easy shots with regret. If he plays like that in the end, you can't do anything. I am not too upset about it. It is just a joy to be involved in a match like this."" O'Sullivan, who has been beaten in three finals this season, is aiming to win the Masters for a record seventh time but when he was told he was in his 12th final, he replied: ""I've only won six though so it's not a very good strike record is it?"" This video can not be played Five great shots as Perry stuns Hawkins Perry was trailing 5-2 in his semi-final against last year's runner-up Barry Hawkins but won the eighth frame despite needing a snooker. He followed that up by winning the next three, including a break of 70 in the decider, to take the match. Perry said: ""I really can't believe it. When Barry potted the ball to leave me a snooker, I was thinking about what to say to him and wish him all the best for Sunday. This game is mad, it never ceases to amaze. ""It is the best win of my career. I have to go out against O'Sullivan and play to the best of my ability. You don't know what can happen. From the go, I will go out there to win and not just enjoy the occasion."" Hawkins said: ""I am devastated. After the eighth frame he started playing better and made an unbelievable break in that last frame."" This video can not be played Is Perry's escape 'better than a 147'? Three-time Masters champion Steve Davis on BBC TV Marco knows how good a performance has beaten him. You can only be admiring of that. We have seen Ronnie O'Sullivan produce something special on a number of occasions but from the adversity of having to change his tip halfway through, against a player who was playing so well, that is just a magnificent performance. Ronnie has to be very proud of himself.

Was there a Trump Twitter glitch?,"Twitter says it's trying to fix ""complications"" with the switchover of the @Potus account. The account for the President of the United States was handed over to Donald Trump on Friday and was supposed to keep its existing followers. Those users were also meant to automatically follow a new archive account with the Obama administration's tweets - @Potus44. But some claim they've not been moved over. Others say they stopped following @Potus before the inauguration, but are now re-following the account even though they didn't choose to do so. This woman says it happened to her,external Janna Zagari says she was following Donald Trump against her will,external Some have compared it to a U2 album automatically downloaded to iTunes in the past,external There are even claims some people who never followed Obama or Trump are automatically following Donald Trump as @Potus. Twitter says it is aware of complications and the issue is being resolved.,external The White House had been working with Twitter on plans for the switchover for some time. This is how the switchover was supposed to work Before the inauguration on Thursday night, @Potus under Barack Obama had 13.6 million followers. @Potus44 now has 14.2 million and @Potus under President Trump has 14.3 million. It's unclear if it's down to new followers or a glitch. Shaolin Cantastic isn't happy to be following Donald Trump,external It's been reported Twitter blames the complications on two scenarios. It could be that those who blocked @Potus before the inauguration effectively blocked @Potus44 (because of workings going on behind the scenes at Twitter). Another suggestion is that some unfollowed @Potus after Twitter had already counted them as a follower to be transferred over to Donald Trump's account. Confusing, right? Twitter previously told Newsbeat both @Potus and @Potus44 should end up with around 13 million followers after the transfer process. This may not account for new followers to both accounts. The switchover took some time overnight with followers dropping on both accounts at first. Meanwhile Donald Trump changed the image at the top of his new @Potus account after Twitter users spotted it was from Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration. Donald Trump posted his inaugural dance with his wife as one of his first tweets,external Several other accounts have also been switched over including @Flotus for Melania Trump and @WhiteHouse from @ObamaWhiteHouse.

Obama leaves Democrats flailing in abyss,"Following the inaugural ceremonies, Barack and Michelle Obama - private citizens once again - were whisked off by a military helicopter stationed behind the US Capitol. They'll spend a few days on holiday at a California desert resort before, as Mr Obamatweeted,externalfrom his personal account, getting ""back to work"". And, for Democrats, there's a lot of hard work to be done. With Mr Obama's departure, the party is only just beginning its long journey in the political wilderness. Democrats have lost Congress. They've been decimated in state legislatures. Their hoped-for liberal majority on the Supreme Court was blocked by intransigent Senate Republicans. And now the presidency is gone, as well. In pictures: Global marches against Trump World media anxious as Trump takes power Trump's angry call to arms This video can not be played Barack Obama's last day as 44th president In the days ahead, the party that thought it had time and demographics on its side, that saw Mr Obama's coalition of young, ethnic and educated voters as a durable governing majority, will try to figure out what, exactly, went wrong. Ironically enough,some liberals,externalare looking at the Tea Party grass-roots conservative movement that emerged in the months after Mr Obama became president in 2009 as a model for their path back to power. At the time, many on the left mocked the impromptu outbursts of conservative protest - which bedevilled Democratic politicians at constituent meetings - as ill-conceived, uninformed or ineffective. Now, they point to recent efforts to confront Republican legislators over attempts to repeal Mr Obama's healthcare reform as signs of life in a dispirited party. Democrats face a tough challenge in the days ahead. They have to settle on a leader for their national committee - resolving an ideological battle between left-wing populists and those who preach continued Obama-style moderation and incrementalism. They need to devise a strategy to win back Congress, complicated by the fact they have to defend 10 Senate seats in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections in states that Donald Trump won. And, before too long, candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination will begin jockeying for position. More than anything else, however, they need to begin rebuilding their party on the local and state level. Mr Obama's successes glossed over a party that is bereft of young leaders working their way up through the ranks. At the moment, the Democratic Party is a skeleton of its former self. Until they put some meat on its bones, memories of the 2008 hope that Obama ushered in - that they were a party of destiny - will seem to liberals like a cruel joke.

Empathy and education in the age of Trump,"Donald Trump has been sworn in as president, after running a divisive campaign The rarefied environs of a Davos cocktail party may not, at first, seem like the ideal place to teach people to understand those with whom they disagree. But Peter Salovey thinks there is no better place to preach the gospel of empathy. As president of Yale, he has direct access to the university's distinguished alumni. Some, such as Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman and Chinese billionaire Zhang Lei, are the very epitome of the so-called global elites against whom there has been somewhat of a populist backlash in the past year. Prof Salovey comes to the World Economic Forum with a message. He says the business leaders in Davos would do well to understand the ordinary men and women behind populist uprisings, such as the one in his own country, which culminated on Friday with the inauguration as President of such an unlikely candidate as Donald Trump. ""We live in a complex world, a world where our fellow citizens are telling us that they feel left out,"" says the convivial psychology professor. Business leaders prepare to temper Trump Davos coverage in full In such times, he adds, reaching across cultural, political and economic divides is more important than ever, and Prof Salovey thinks he knows how to help Davos delegates do just that. Prof Salovey says the Davos elite must try to understand what has driven populist uprisings ""How does one learn how to listen, how does one learn how to think critically, how does one learn how to communicate? And how does one learn to develop emotional intelligence, the ability to empathise with another person?"" The answer, he says, lies in education - in particular, the humanities. To that end, the function room at the Belvedere Hotel in which Yale's annual reception is held features some rather novel exhibits, at least for a forum mostly dedicated to dealing with the immediate present. In conjunction with the Smithsonian, delegates can explore some of the world's most endangered languages by watching interactive videos of their last remaining native speakers, or flick through an archive of pictures displaying ordinary Americans at work in factories and farms - taken for propaganda purposes at the behest of Franklin D Roosevelt, in order to highlight the success of his New Deal. Perusing such artefacts, says Prof Salovey, can help the gathered Davos crowd grapple with complex problems such us: ""What are the fundamental problems that humans have grappled with for millennia? What are ways in which we share a common humanity?"" Davos delegates at Yale's annual reception can look through old photographs to try to learn from the past He says people do feel that they have worked hard and paid their dues, and yet still they feel downwardly mobile. ""That's not the American dream,"" he adds. One person who understands the American dream all too well is Lonnie Bunch, the founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), which was opened to great fanfare by President Obama in Washington just a few months ago. President Obama, pictured here with Lonnie Bunch at a reception at the White House a day before opening the NMAAHC Since then, nearly a million people have wandered through its doors, and encountered one of America's darkest moments, in slavery, and one of its greatest strengths, in the huge contributions of African Americans to the country's cultural makeup. ""I think it is crucially important in the times we are living in to be able to give people a sense of hope and possibility, but to also help them understand that despite how bad you may think things are, they were once worse, and people struggled to improve, across racial lines,"" says Mr Bunch. Addressing the assembled businessmen and women, he says: ""You can't be a good businessman without understanding the societal issues that have shaped the moment you are in. ""Businessmen always forecast what they think is the next trend. Part of that comes from understanding the past. ""What we want is not only for people to understand the past but also to bring those skills of the humanities - critical thinking, nuance, ambiguity - to basically be able to be nimble, to wrestle with a variety of issues, not just have a single point of view."" However, Mr Bunch stresses, ""change doesn't happen without struggle, without sacrifice."" Alluding to the incoming US administration, the historian says that it is ""incumbent upon all who enter the museum to be an activist, to help make America better"". Mr Bunch has been director of the Smithsonian Institution's NMAAHC since 2005 For his part, Prof Salovey is committed to defending the values of educational institutions such as Yale, not just as bastions of free expression, but also as havens for diversity. ""We believe that the most stimulating educational environment that we could create comes when we have a wonderful mix of the world on our campus,"" he says, in a thinly veiled broadside at Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric. ""We have policies on campus who support students called 'Dreamers', who came to the US as children, but perhaps their parents were not documented. ""We support DACA, the act that gives a status to people whose immigration status may be ambiguous, or undocumented."" Prof Salovey cites his own family heritage - his grandparents, he says, were uneducated immigrants and education lifted their children out of poverty. This, he says, is the American value he most wants to protect. ""We want to educate the world,"" he emphasises. ""I'm not willing to give up on that, and I will advocate as vigorously as I know how, to continue that tradition in all of our institutions of higher learning.""

Reliving a tragedy,"The 2004 Beslan school siege is remembered for the deaths of more than 330 people including 186 children, after a Russian school was seized by Chechen rebels. But the Belgian creators of a play, Us/Them, which relives the atrocity through the eyes of two children, say recent attacks have brought the story closer to home. The actress Gytha Parmentier has now played Us/Them in three languages. When the play opened in 2014 she was speaking in her native Flemish. Later she had to translate into French the words of her character - a young girl who dies in the Beslan siege. Now she's making the one-hour piece work in English opposite Roman Van Houtven, the only other member of cast. Last year the play was a hit at the Edinburgh Festival and it has now arrived at London's National Theatre. ""Acting in English, Roman and I had to learn to move our mouths in a very different way,"" she said. ""But acting in a different language gives a new juiciness to what's in the script."" That script is by Carly Wijs, who also directs. She recalls the spark for the play came when her eight year-old son mentioned news coverage he'd just seen of the terror attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013. ""Godfried had been watching the report on the children's news and I was struck by the way he described it. He spoke in a way which was almost aloof - at eight you're just becoming aware of things which are on your planet but not really of your own world of home and family. ""Then Bronks, which is a fantastic production company in Brussels, asked me for a theatre idea for children. So I thought I would break a taboo by writing about Beslan while borrowing Godfried's tone and his very objective manner."" In Belgium Wij/Zij has been listed as suitable for children of nine and above; in London the National Theatre pitches Us/Them for young people aged 12 and over. The highly physical production is made for touring and the Dorfman stage at the National is almost bare apart from balloons and string. The production avoids the off-putting cuteness which can trip up adult actors impersonating young children.  The result is heart-breaking yet somehow heart-warming too. The show may not strike theatregoers in advance as an obvious excursion for kids. But it's an unexpectedly charming hour in the theatre perfect for family viewing. However, the National has mainly programmed performances late in the evening which may be a bad call. Wijs says her view of the events of 2004 was influenced by one TV documentary in particular. ""There was a beautiful BBC programme called Children of Beslan which was helpful: they spoke to many survivors.  But our play isn't a documentary.  It has to work for children who know nothing of Beslan and also for their parents who remember all that went on."" Parmentier says there are clear differences between how children and grown-ups react. ""Adults tend to laugh and cry in a different way: often the laughter is in relief when they think something horrible is about to happen on the stage and it doesn't. ""I think parents automatically work out a narrative arc in their minds but children are happy to switch their attention from one thing to another."" Wijs thinks for children almost the most horrifying thing is when the girl has to undress to her underwear because it's getting hot and stuffy in the school gymnasium. ""To them it's a nightmare but I suspect adults barely register the moment."" The play pre-dates last March's terror attacks in Brussels in which a total of 35 people died and hundreds were injured. Wijs lived in the Molenbeek district, a focus in the city of Islamist radicalisation. ""We haven't changed the play because of those bombings but if the Brussels attacks had come first I wonder if I could have created the play.  I've just done another play in Brussels which is full of light and comedy - it's a reaction to the depressing times we live in. But both women say they haven't ignored recent violence closer to home. ""In 2015 in Belgium we had a performance in Namur in (French-speaking) Wallonia, a few days after the Bataclan attack in Paris"", says Parmentier. ""We and the theatre thought hard about whether we should cancel: would it be too hard to watch a play about so many people being killed? But instead the theatre arranged an audience discussion after the show and people were full of questions about what they had just seen.  I think the play helped some of them process what had happened in Paris."" Us/Them is playing at the National Theatre until 18 February.

Undercover officers,"When the so-called Islamic State group seized control of a town near Mosul and began killing police officers, some of them resorted to unconventional measures to stay alive, reports John Beck. A niqab saved Abu Alawi. For more than two-and-a-half years it helped keep the middle-aged former police officer hidden from IS and safe from the bullets and knives that killed almost all his colleagues. When the jihadists arrived in his hometown of Hammam al-Alil in mid-2014, as they swept across northern Iraq, the first things they did was to round up police and army officers. They killed the higher-ranking men immediately, but eventually offered an amnesty of sorts to the rest. If they renounced the government in Baghdad and pledged to live under IS rules, then they'd go free. Abu Alawi stayed in hiding. At first in his home or a bolthole dug in his garden. But IS searches became more stringent and he realised that he'd have to move further afield. Ahmed, 22, from a pro-government militia, stands in a burnt-out building used by IS as a prison The solution, he decided, was a niqab - the black, face-concealing veil that IS forces all women under its rule to wear. From then on, when a sympathetic friend would tip him off about impending searches, he'd shroud his moustachioed face and portly figure and move somewhere safer, disguised as a woman. Find us on Facebook,external There was a thrill, he said, in ""playing"" with IS, but when he passed close by the black-clad militants it wasn't fun any more. Then he feared he'd share the fate of friends who'd donned the same disguise but been less lucky, or less convincing, and were arrested as a result. ""They were near to me so many times and I was so afraid,"" he said, miming a heart pounding in his chest. ""All the time I was thinking I was going to be checked and discovered."" IS eventually left Hammam al-Alil, setting oil wells alight as it went Hammam al-Alil is a former spa town, once famous for the therapeutic powers of its thermal springs. It's hard to imagine holidaymakers visiting now. I met Abu Alawi there as he waited for a Danish non-governmental organisation to distribute blankets and solar heaters on a cold and damp winter morning.

Federal police took me to one mass grave, a police shooting range turned rubbish dump. The awful smell was the first sign of what had happened there. Then came the clouds of flies and, lying amid the refuse, between discarded children's toys and food packaging, the badly decomposed remains of a man - his hands and legs bound and marked by signs of torture. ""Under here it's all bodies,"" our escort said, gesturing towards a series of narrow trenches covered with bulldozed earth and he cautioned that the area was probably still booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices. He estimated there were at least 350 people buried in the area. A police officer at mass grave site outside Hammam al-Alil Another man in the aid distribution queue, Abu Ali - younger, taller and thinner than Abu Alawi - produced his old police ID card. He'd buried it in his garden while IS was here, and he too had survived the massacre, in part thanks to a niqab. ""All I did was hide, hide and wear the veil like this,"" he said, stooping over to minimise his stature. His brother, a fellow officer, was executed, leaving behind a wife and seven children. And when they left Hammam al-Ali, IS took Abu Ali's father with them to Mosul as a human shield. This was not a unique story. Everyone I spoke to in the town had lost someone, some entire families. One militia member in his early 20s said IS had killed his parents and murdered or captured seven of his brothers. But a semblance of normal life has in some ways returned to the town. At the dilapidated thermal baths near the banks of the Tigris, smiling children and soldiers played in the warm waters. Others collected grey mineral-rich mud in bottles and touted its therapeutic qualities. It may be the start of healing, but the scars of occupation by IS will last for some time yet.

Battle of the left,"Seven candidates are vying for the Socialist nomination, including one woman, Sylvia Pinel France is choosing its left-wing presidential candidate this weekend, in what is seen as a crucial test for the direction - even the survival - of the governing Socialist Party. Six men and one woman are competing for the nomination, with former Prime Minister Manuel Valls currently seen as the frontrunner. But will this contest go any way to uniting a Left bitterly divided by five years in power, and a president too unpopular to seek a second term? With the tide out, the muddy inlet of Saint-Brieuc seems to sleep in the watery afternoon sun.  Its shore deserted but for two Portuguese men picking their way along the sand, looking for worms. The northern coast of Brittany has until recently been a staunch Socialist area Above them, a small, green-topped lighthouse sits on the rocks, and basking in the wan sunlight at its foot is a local pensioner, Patrick Labbe. ""This is a left-wing stronghold,"" Patrick told me. ""But that's less and less the case. The Socialist Party has been a disaster on social issues - just look around Saint-Brieuc and you'll see so much destitution."" Saint-Brieuc sits on the northern coast of Brittany; one of the most reliably Socialist regions in France, and a source of support for left-wing candidates seeking to win the first round of the primary contest on 22 January. This video can not be played Why the French presidential election matters But Patrick says attitudes are changing: ""I voted for [President] Hollande, and like a lot of French I'm disappointed."" ""The Socialist Party will struggle to pick itself up. There's a lot of abstention. People are turning to the extremes, in particular Marine Le Pen. Those who are really disappointed want a big change."" Sparking interest in this primary is seen as crucial to reviving the chances of France's governing party, and uniting a scattered field of candidates on the left. Read more on France's main presidential candidates: Francois Fillon - centre-right favourite What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Emmanuel Macron - France's ambitious 'man on the move' As Patrick Labbe headed home on his bicycle, Manuel Valls was arriving at a local factory a few kilometres away, to drum up some support. Peering into the cabs of armoured cars, as men in blue overalls applied the finishing seals, Mr Valls seemed as coolly polite as the atmosphere itself, the workers barely glancing up as their former prime minister passed by. Manuel Valls (R) is currently favourite but Arnaud Montebourg (L) is seen as one of his two main challengers Mr Valls is the favourite to win the left-wing nomination - seen as more authoritative and experienced, according to one poll, if a little remote. But after serving as prime minister to France's least popular post-war president, and forcing through some of the government's most hated liberal reforms, his challenge has been to reinvent himself as a unifier of the Left. Since launching his campaign, the former prime minister has reversed his position on key issues like labour rights, and the government's use of the constitution to bypass parliament. ""I've changed,"" he says. One opinion poll suggested Benoit Hamon (R) could win the nomination if he went through to the run-off Perhaps it's no surprise, given the strong competition from party rebel Arnaud Montebourg, who has been snapping at his heels for weeks.  A former industry minister, who was sacked after refusing to support Mr Valls's liberal reforms, he's promised an end to austerity and more investment. And in the past couple of days, hard-left candidate, Benoit Hamon, has surged from behind to challenge Mr Montebourg for a place in the primary run-off on 29 January.  Among his core proposals are a monthly payment of â¬750 (Â£650; $800) to every French citizen, regardless of income; and the legalisation of cannabis. A fourth Socialist party candidate and former education minister, Vincent Peillon, is trying to catch up with them with plans to revamp Europe, lower taxes on the poor and invest in green technology. Three hopefuls from other left-wing parties are currently trailing well behind: Sylvia Pinel (Radical Party of the Left), Jean-Luc Bennahmias (Democratic Front) and Francois de Rugy (Ecology party). Far-left Jean-Luc Melenchon (L) and Emmanuel Macron are both polling ahead of all the Socialist candidates But the real competition could come from outside the primary itself, because two of the Left's most popular politicians aren't even taking part. Jean-Luc Melenchon is running for the presidency on his own, far-left ticket, and could pose a real challenge to candidates like Mr Montebourg or Mr Hamon, should they win. And then there's Emmanuel Macron, the renegade protege of President Hollande, who resigned from his ministerial post to launch a new political movement called En Marche, promising liberal values and a fresh approach to politics. His growing appeal among young voters has surprised many sceptics who initially wrote him off as a ""champagne bubble"" that would quickly burst. These days his presidential campaign attracts crowds in their thousands, where the leading primary candidates manage only hundreds. Mr Macron classes his movement as ""neither left nor right"" but his centrist agenda is attracting many formerly Socialist voters. The truth about this primary contest is that whoever wins the nomination could quickly find themselves face to face with the real battle for the Left.

Eight ways Trump's presidency makes history,"Donald Trump has already pulled off a series of presidential ""firsts"" Donald Trump is guaranteed to make history as the 45th president of the United States. And whether you love or loathe him, it's a fact that the Republican will set a range of records as soon as he occupies the Oval Office. From his age to his bank balance, via his notable lack of pets - here are just some of ""The Donald's"" historic ""firsts"". Donald Trump celebrated his 70th birthday on 14 June, which makes him the oldest man in US history to assume the presidency. The previous record-holder, Ronald Reagan, was 69 when he took office in 1981. Perhaps keen to allay fears about his senior status, the business mogulhad his doctor prepare a gushing letterpledging that he would be ""the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"". Right-wing Indian activists celebrate The Donald's 70th birthday in New Delhi The average age of all 44 previous incoming presidents is a sprightly 55. The youngest ever incumbent - Theodore Roosevelt - got the job aged 42 years and 322 days, after President William McKinley's assassination in 1901. Mr Trump is the first billionaire president. Exact estimates of his personal wealth vary, with Forbes putting it at $3.7bn (Â£3bn) and the man himself claiming in a statement that it's ""in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS"". Many of America's past presidents have also been extremely wealthy, of course. Recent estimates say George Washington's estate would be worth half a billion in today's dollars. Donald Trump has said he will take only a dollar in salary - like former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger (L) Before his 1963 assassination, JFK reportedly lived off a $10m trust fund thanks to the vast wealth of his father - investor and alleged bootlegger Joseph P Kennedy, Sr. Mr Trump will be following in the footsteps of former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger bytaking just a symbolic dollar as a salary. When Mr Trump began unveiling his cabinet picks, the number with fat wallets quickly drew the scorn of Democrats. ""Donald Trump's administration: of, by and for the millionaires and billionaires,"" tweeted Vermont Senator and Democrat presidential contender Bernie Sanders. For better or worse, this will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history. Trump picks America's 'richest cabinet' Ethics concerns swirl around Trump team According to the Washington Post,external, commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross is worth around $2.5bn on his own - roughly 10 times what George W Bush's first cabinet were worth in 2001, when the media branded them an assembly of millionaires. Treasury appointee Steven Mnuchin quite literally bought a bank after 17 years at Goldman Sachs, and reports put his wealth at over $40m. It has been estimated that the cabinet could be good for an eye-watering $35bn, all told.As Quartz pointed out,external, this is more than the annual gross domestic product of Bolivia. Mr Trump's triumph is also significant because, until now, no-one has been elected president in more than 60 years without experience as a state governor or in Congress. The last president with no political experience, Dwight Eisenhower, was Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War Two, before he was elected to office in 1953. Some Trump voters saw his lack of political experience as a guarantee of authenticity But as Mr Trump tells it, his lack of links to the Washington establishment is an asset not a flaw - and more than made up for by his experience as a deal-maker. Mr Trump has named his son-in-law, real estate developer Jared Kushner, as a senior adviser - promptingcries of nepotism from opponents. Some claim the appointment makes the 36-year-old the most powerful presidential son-in-law in US history. A list of Trump's potential conflicts Trump hands Scottish businesses to sons What now for Ivanka Trump? He isn't the first to fit that profile, however. President Woodrow Wilson's Treasury Secretary, William Gibbs McAdoo, was also married to his daughter, Eleanor. First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are set to wield considerable clout That said, their case pre-dates America's 1967 anti-nepotism statute, and Mr McAdoo was already a cabinet secretary when he wed. Ivanka Trump, Mr Trump's elder daughter and wife of Mr Kushner, is also being spoken of as the most influential ""First Daughter"" ever. So much fuss has been made of what Donald Trump owns that you might have missed one glaring absence - a pet. It looks likely that he'll be the first US President in over a century not to have an animal pal in the White House, after plans to have him adopt a goldendoodle dog reportedly fell through. According to the Presidential Pet Museum,external, almost every commander-in-chief has had a pet, and some had a virtual menagerie. John F Kennedy stands out for owning a veritable Noah's Ark - everything from a rabbit named Zsa Zsa to a canary called Robin - but the crown belongs to Calvin and Grace Coolidge (White House occupants from 1923-1929), who the museum says ""quite literally had a zoo"". Barack Obama's Portuguese Water Dog, Bo, is among the more traditional pets to live at the White House Their animal companions included at least a dozen dogs, a donkey named Ebenezer, and various creatures presented as gifts by foreign dignitaries - among them lion cubs, a wallaby, a pygmy hippo named Billy, and a black bear. Donald Trump won the presidency on a pro-job platform, and has blamed free-trade policies for the collapse of the US manufacturing industry. This is a rare stance for a US president, probably last seen in his fellow Republican Herbert Hoover in the 1930s. In September 2015, Mr Trump told the Economist China is ""killing us"",external, and that millions of Americans are ""tired of being ripped off"". He said that as president, he would consider a 12% import tax to make the Chinese ""stop playing games"". US to quit Pacific trade deal - Trump What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? During his election campaign, Mr Trump also threatened to rip up Nafta, the free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which has been in place for 23 years. The Republican has long been opposed to the TPP, which he views as a poor deal for the US He also vowed that the US would quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a 12-nation agreement, on his first day in the White House. Former model Melania Trump is as trailblazing as her husband. She will be the first presidential spouse from Slovenia, and the first non-native English speaker. She is only the second FLOTUS born outside the US, though - the first being Louisa Adams, wife of the sixth US President, John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), who was born in London. As Mr Trump has been married twice before, Melania will also be the first third wife to reside in the White House. The only other US president to have divorced was Ronald Reagan, who split from his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, long before leading the nation. Designers split over dressing Melania Is Melania's White House snub unusual? Melania speaks Slovenian, English, French, German, and Serbian, and may be the most competent linguist to hold the role of FLOTUS. Melania Trump will be the first non-native English speaker to be FLOTUS She is the first president's wife to have posed nude, for GQ magazine in 2000 among others.

PM congratulates Trump on taking office,"Theresa May has congratulated Donald Trump on taking office as US president - and says she looks forward to meeting him in Washington. The prime minister stressed her belief he was committed to advancing the ""special relationship"" with the UK. ButMrs May told the Financial Times,externalshe expects ""very frank"" talks on areas where their opinions seem to differ such as the EU and Nato. The PM said she hoped for early progress on a US-UK trade agreement. Mrs May said she believed Mr Trump ""recognises the importance and  significance of Nato"", despite himbeing quoted earlier in the week as describing the military alliance as ""obsolete"". ""I'm also confident the USA will recognise the importance of the co-operation we have in Europe to ensure our collective defence and collective security,"" she told the FT. UK women set to march against Trump Trump tracker: Can the president deliver? Mr Trump also said recently he did not really care if the EU separated. Mrs May, who this weekoutlined for the first time her plan for Brexit, said: ""The decision taken by the UK was not a decision about breaking up the EU. ""I want the EU to continue to be strong and I want to continue to have a close and strategic partnership with the EU. It is important for security issues. With the threats we face it's not the time for less co-operation."" Mr Trump was sworn-in as the 45th US president on Friday. In a statement issued after the inauguration, Mrs May said: ""From our conversations to date, I know we are both committed to advancing the special relationship between our two countries and working together for the prosperity and security of people on both sides of the Atlantic. ""I look forward to discussing these issues and more when we meet in Washington."" In her FT interview, Mrs May said she was ""confident we can look at areas even in advance of being able to sign a formal trade deal"". This video can not be played ""We will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come"", Donald Trump said But despiteMr Trump's indication he backed a quick post-Brexit trade deal, there was a heavily protectionist tone in theinauguration speech. Some Labour MPs questioned how the prime minister's aim of a free trade deal with the US would be possible given the ""America first"" strategy outlined by Mr Trump. David Lammytweeted,external: ""Every decision on trade will be made to benefit Americans. Hmm - looking forward to this trade deal, then."" Chris Bryant said: ""I'm not sure a UK trade deal with Trump will be very mutually beneficial."" However, speaking to the BBC in Myanmar, also known as Burma, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was every reason to ""be positive and optimistic"" about a trade deal. ""I think the new president has made it very clear that he wants to put Britain at the front of the line... and obviously that's extremely exciting and important"". Earlier Mr Johnson offered his own ""warmest congratulations"" to Mr Trump. He said the UK would ""work hand in glove for the stability, the prosperity and the security of the world"". Meanwhile,Thousands of women are expected to join a march in London lateras part of an international protest campaign on the first full day of Mr Trump's presidency. Mr Trump has appeared to make good on a pledge to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House's Oval Office. The bust of Sir Winston Churchill can be seen on the far left as Mr Trump prepares to sign his first orders in the Oval Office The sculpture of the World War Two prime minister's face is said to be a replica of one given to President Lyndon B Johnson in the 1960s and first appeared in the Oval Office during George W Bush's administration in 2001. It wasreplaced by a bust of civil rights champion Martin Luther King Jr during Barack Obama's presidency. The presence of the Churchill bust was noticed as Mr Trump signed his first orders as president. A report that the bust of Dr King no longer remained in the Oval Office was later found to be discredited.

Obama crowd picture gaffe,"Donald Trump changed the image at the top of his new @POTUS account after Twitter users spotted it was from Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration. Mr Trump inherited the official presidential account as he was sworn in as America's 45th president. The original image showed flag-waving crowds in front of the US Capitol. But it was changed about an hour later, amid claims from Mr Trump's opponents that crowds at his inauguration were not as large as in 2013. Full text of Trump's speech In pictures: Trump inauguration day Five ways people are protesting Trump What Trump supporters want from their president Trump supporters on social media branded claims Mr Trump was trying to make his inauguration appear better-attended ""pathetic"" and a ""non-story"".

Mr Trump's @POTUS account,externalhas gained millions of followers since its launch, as all 13.6m followers of Barack Obama's account - now archived at @POTUS44,external- are in the process of being ported over to the new Trump account. The new president's first tweet was a link to a Facebook post of the full text of his inauguration address. Hisformer twitter account,externalstill has more than 20m followers. Staff replaced the Obama crowd image The header image was changed again shortly afterwards Speaking ahead of the event, Mr Trump said his inauguration would have ""an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout"". But the number of people who turned out to view his midday swearing-in appeared to be smaller than the estimated two million who turned out for Obama. Images of the National Mall, taken from the top of the Washington Monument, showed sections of the white matting laid down to protect the grass were largely empty.

"Group's 'fit, mildly eccentric men' plea","Chelmsford Morris was founded in 1972 and currently has about 30 members - but most are now women A decades-old Morris dancing group says it desperately needs ""fit, mildly eccentric men"" to join in order to keep going. Chelmsford Morris was founded in 1972 and currently has about 30 members. However, the vast majority of members are now women and some male members are expected to retire soon. Club bagman Celia Kemp said the the situation meant ""the men of Chelmsford Morris may have to stop dancing in 2017 because of a shortage of dancers"". ""Eccentricity is not a requirement but is usually the definition of a Morris dancer,"" says Celia Kemp ""The women's side is doing really quite well,"" she said. ""They are going from strength to strength. ""But we really need some younger people to join. We have nine grown up sons between us and none of them have taken up Morris dancing. ""We would like people who have perhaps got fed up with the gym and who want to try something new - it is also such a good social life. ""Eccentricity is not a requirement but is usually the definition of a Morris dancer."" Dances usually involve six or eight men. But the club currently has seven male dancers who can perform most of the dances.

Picasso prints go on show in Yorkshire,"Pablo Picasso visited South Yorkshire in 1950 for an international peace conference An exhibition of original prints by world-renowned artist Pablo Picasso are to go on show at a museum in Barnsley. The 17 linocut prints are on display from Saturday at a free exhibition at the town's Cooper Gallery. The valuable prints are out on loan from the British Museum and were previously on display at the Lady Lever Art Gallery near Liverpool. Barnsley-born Ian Macmillan has written a poem about a previous visit by the artist to South Yorkshire. Mr Macmillan was inspired by Picasso's visit to Sheffield in 1950 for an international peace conference. Live updates from this and more Yorkshire stories The Spanish artist is acknowledged to be one of the most important artists of the 20th Century. He experimented with a wide range of styles and themes in his long career, most notably inspiring Cubism. The prints are on loan from the British Museum for the first time Picasso experimented with a wide range of styles and themes in his long career, most notably inspiring Cubism The artworks at the gallery include prints showing the development of key Picasso prints including Jacqueline Reading that depicts the artist's wife, Jacqueline Roque. Mr Macmillan said: ""It shows the dynamic cultural times we're living through round here and that the town is becoming even more of an artistic and creative hub.""

How did Trump manage digital transition?,"President Trump's first tweet on the @POTUS account showed this image Much is written about the Herculean effort to move one family out of the White House and a new family in within the space ofjust a few hours,external. But in our modern age, the digital moving trucks must also roar into action, as prime presidential online real estate gets a makeover, and eight years of President Obama's social media chat is confined to the national archives. Letâs start with WhiteHouse.gov, the official website for the President, which as of noon Friday, has a brand new look - and has already provoked mild panic. Many noted thatpages about climate change were swiftly deleted,external. So too were pages about LGBT rights and various science policies. But, letâs not get ahead of ourselves. Pages abouteverythingwere deleted as what was essentially Obamaâs homepage was replaced with Trumpâs. That means posts about any former policy positions no longer exist on the White House website if you follow the original links. So while the web address pointing to the White Houseâs position on climate change no longer works, the same can be said about Obamaâs pages relating to the economy. Unpredictable as he is, no-one is suggesting Donald Trump is about to describe âmoneyâ as a hoax. That said, on the new whitehouse.gov, a search for âmilitaryâ will yield 154 results. âClimate changeâ? None. Nervous internet sleuths have found one reference to climate change, a promise to lift the ""harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rules"". Make of that what you will. People on Twitter certainly are. Also wiped clean was the White House's petition website. On Friday, by 4pm in DC, only two petitions were posted on the site. The firstdemanded the release of the President's tax returns,external. The otherdemanded he put his businesses in a blind trust,external. If either petition gets 100,000 signatures, the White House has to provide a response - at least, that was the rule the previous administration set itself. Trump reportedly gave up his cell phone upon assuming the presidency From @POTUS to @POTUS44 Speaking of which, itâs all change on Twitter too. From today@POTUS,external- President of the United States - has been taken over by the Trump team. All previous tweets from Obamaâs team - and Obama himself - have been deleted from that account, but archived under@POTUS44,external. The 44 relating of course to the fact Obama was the 44th US President. The tweets were not, as a smattering of people blurted out, âdeleted by Trumpâ once he had control of the account. Twitter removed them - and that's because scrubbing the account of Obamaâs tweets is a smart move for everyone involved. Had Twitter left the old tweets in place youâll find yourself seeing people retweeting Obamaâs words but with Trumpâs identity attached, a recipe for misinformation disaster. Trumpâsfirst tweet on @POTUS,externalposted a picture and a link to his inaugural address  -the full text of which was posted on Facebook,external. Is Trump having a change of heart over his social network of choice? Maybe. Facebook certainly offers the chance to speak more clearly at length, and, as the leader of the free world, it would be more useful to post to an audience of almost two billion rather than Twitterâs rather limited 300m. We wonât know for sure until about 3am, DC time, tomorrow morning. Everyone will be surely waiting for those twilight hours to see if the President springs back into life posting his thoughts on his own personal account,@realDonaldTrump,external.

The improbable rise of Donald Trump,"Long before making three consecutive bids for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most flamboyant billionaire. The New York real estate mogul's life was splashed all over tabloids and television in the decades leading up to his improbable 2015-16 run for the White House. His household name and unfiltered campaign style helped him defeat seasoned politicians - but a controversy-filled tenure saw him booted from office after a single term. Now 78, the Republican is again defying the odds as he mounts a stunning political comeback that could end with him back behind the president's desk in the Oval Office. He took the reins of the family business in 1971 Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school. After earning a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, he became favoured to succeed his father when his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. Fred Trump died at 43 from alcoholism, something that his brother says led him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life. He shifted the company's focus from Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan Trump says he got into real estate with a ""small"" $1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971. His father, who Trump describes as ""my inspiration"", died in 1999. His celebrity and media profile expanded with his business empire Under Trump, the family business shifted from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects. The famed Fifth Avenue became home to Trump Tower, arguably the mogul's most famous property and his home for many years. The rundown Commodore Hotel was restored as the Grand Hyatt. Other properties bearing the Trump brand name - casinos, condominiums, golf courses and hotels - were erected too, from Atlantic City, Chicago and Las Vegas to India, Turkey and the Philippines. His rise to stardom continued in the entertainment world - first as an owner of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants, then as creator-host of NBC reality show The Apprentice. He hosted 14 seasons of The Apprentice, a reality show that also featured his kids Over 14 seasons, as Apprentice contestants competed for a management contract in his business empire, his trademark ""You're fired!"" line made ""the Donald"" a household name. Trump has written several books, appeared in movies and pro-wrestling programming, and sold everything from beverages to neckties. But his net worth has dropped in recent years, with Forbes estimating he is currently worth around $4bn. Trump has also filed business bankruptcies on six separate occasions, and several of his ventures - including Trump Steaks and Trump University - have collapsed. He has also shielded his tax information from scrutiny, and reporting in 2020 from The New York Times revealed years of income tax avoidance and chronic financial losses. His marriage to and divorce from Ivana Zelnickova were the source of intense public interest Trump's personal life has received extensive publicity. His first, and arguably most famous, wife was Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before their divorce in 1990. Their acrimonious court battle made the front pages of gossip columns, and the late Mrs Trump's allegations of domestic abuse - which she later downplayed - feature in a new movie about Trump. He married actress Marla Maples in 1993, two months after the birth of their only child Tiffany. They divorced in 1999. He shares one son - Barron, 18 - with current wife Melania Trump Trump's current wife is former Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They married in 2005 and share a son, Barron William Trump, who recently turned 18. Allegations of sexual misconduct and extramarital affairs have followed Trump the politician. Earlier this year, two separate juries ruled that Trump defamed writer E Jean Carroll by denying her accusation of sexual assault. He was ordered to pay her $88m in total, but has appealed. Trump was also convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money arrangement with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels over an alleged extramarital encounter in 2006. In a 1980 interview, a 34-year-old Trump describes politics as ""a very mean life"" and says ""the most capable people"" instead choose the business world. By 1987 though, he began teasing a presidential bid. He briefly explored entering the 2000 race with the Reform Party, then again in 2012 as a Republican. Trump was among the most vocal proponents of ""birtherism"", the conspiracy theory questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US. He did not admit it was a lie until 2016 and never apologised. It all started with a ride down the golden escalator at Trump Tower It was not until June 2015 that Trump formally announced a bid for the White House, declaring the American Dream dead but promising to ""bring it back bigger and better"". The freewheeling address saw him flaunt his wealth and business success; accuse Mexico of sending drugs, crime and rapists to the US; and, promise to make the country pay for a border wall. Dominating displays on the debate stage and a controversy-riddled policy platform attracted adoring fans and fierce critics in equal measure, as well as a torrent of media attention. He dominated the 2015-16 Republican primary Under the 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan, he easily muscled past rivals in the Republican Party to face off against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The novice campaign was marred by controversy, including a leaked audio tape of him bragging about sexual abuse, and he trailed in opinion polls throughout the general election. But Trump had the last laugh against pundits and pollsters with his stunning victory over a veteran politician. He was sworn in as the country's 45th president on 20 January 2017. From the very first hours, he brought unrivalled drama to the job, often making formal announcements on Twitter (now X) and clashing openly with foreign leaders. The Trump presidency was an uncertain time for US allies He withdrew from major climate and trade agreements, banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, issued other tough immigration restrictions, launched a trade war with China, implemented record tax cuts, and reshaped Middle Eastern relations. For nearly two years, a special counsel probed alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. Thirty-four people faced criminal charges - on matters such as computer hacking and financial crimes - but not Trump. The investigation did not establish criminal collusion. Soon after, Trump became just the third US president in history to be impeached, over accusations he pressured a foreign government to dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden. He was impeached by a Democrat-led House of Representatives but acquitted in a Republican-led Senate. His 2020 election year was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. He faced intense criticism for his handling of the crisis as the US led the globe in deaths and infections and for controversial comments, like suggesting research into whether the virus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body. He was forced to take a break from the campaign trail in October after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 himself. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump on Covid-19 in his own words Though he eventually received 74 million votes - more than any other sitting US president - he lost the race to Mr Biden by more than seven million votes. From November 2020 to January 2021, he amplified claims of stolen votes and widespread electoral fraud - claims that were knocked down in more than 60 court cases. Refusing to accept the results, Trump rallied supporters in Washington on 6 January, urging them to converge on the Capitol as Mr Biden's victory was to be formally certified by Congress. That rally devolved into a riot that placed lawmakers and his own vice-president in danger and led to a historic second impeachment. Trump was again acquitted by the Senate, albeit more narrowly. His actions on the day are now the focus of two criminal cases. This video can not be played How Trump spent his last day as president Trump's political career appeared as good as dead after the storming of the Capitol. Donors and supporters vowed never to support him again, and even his closest allies publicly disavowed him. He skipped his successor's inauguration and moved his family to Florida but, with a loyal army of fans still behind him, retained massive influence over the Republican Party. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of his presidency came after it ended - when the three right-wing justices he had nominated to the Supreme Court cemented a conservative majority that helped end nearly 50 years of national abortion rights. Despite being blamed for poor Republican returns in the 2022 midterm elections, Trump announced another run for president and soon became his party's clear frontrunner. More than a dozen opponents, including his former vice-president, challenged him but fell short as Trump avoided the debate stage and trained his fire on Mr Biden. This video can not be played Watch: We asked MAGA: is there anything good about Biden? Trump began the general election facing 91 felony charges across four criminal cases but his strategy of delaying legal cases has largely succeeded. Three cases will now no longer take place before the election, and his sentencing in New York - on arguably the weakest set of charges - has been delayed until late November. On 13 July, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds from an AR-style rifle from atop a nearby roof, wounding Trump in his right ear before the gunman was killed by counter-snippers. Days later, at the Republican National Convention, the party lavished him with praise on him and officially coronated him the Republican presidential candidate for a third consecutive time, setting up an apparent rematch with Mr Biden. A historically unpopular president, the Democrat's tenure has been marked by post-pandemic economic and infrastructure gains, but also high inflation, surges in illegal immigration and foreign policy chaos. Since Mr Biden stepped aside and endorsed his deputy, Kamala Harris, Trump has sought to tie her to the administration's failures - with middling success. National polls indicate that, while Ms Harris has galvanised liberal voters and raised millions of dollars, the race is deadlocked. He has told his supporters that 5 November 2024 - the date of the US election - will be ""the most important date in the history of our country"".

"Sorry cats, doggos run the internetÂ now","This is Igor, a very good dog Like many a BBC reporter before, I come to you with news of a coup, and perhaps the most significant transition of power youâll read about this weekend. Cats on the internet are over. Done. ""Cheezburgers,external"" are off the menu. Play yourself out,Keyboard Cat,external. While in years past weâve perhaps welcomed the charming cynicism of the likes of Grumpy Cat, it seems people of the internet are now, in stranger times, longing instead for the unconditional and unwavering love of dogs - and I have the highly subjective data to prove it. Trending Letâs start with Reddit. The top three posts of all time on itsr/aww subreddit,external, the section for all things cuddly, are all about dogs. ""But wait!"" you might say. ""The fourth one is a cat!,external"". Ah, but is it? It begins with a cat, but watch closely as it climbs out of its cage and into the one next to it. What does the cat find? A dog! That should be all the proof you need. If it isnât, hereâs something a bit more concrete. This is Gavin, a very good dog Socialbakers is a company that monitors social media for trends and stats relating to things that are most popular. I got in touch with them about this, and within hours they came back to me with the goods. For starters, the runaway champion of most popular animal on Facebook is a dog namedBoo,external. Heâs got more than 17.5m likes, more than double that of his closest competitor, Grumpy Cat. In third place, Nyan Cat - who isnât even a real cat, for crying out loud. On Instagram, fine, Iâll admit, the top celebrity is acat,external. But2nd,external,3rd,externaland4th,externalplace? All dogs. Allgooddogs. When it comes to searches on Google, dogs . But more significant was the historic moment on 3 January 2016, when, for the first time, the term""cute dogs"" overtook ""funny cats"",externalin global searches. I think Iâve proved my point. Puppers Like any viral phenomena, thereâs a new vocabulary to get your head around if you are to be a part of this new term of internet governance. Dogs arenât just dogs. Theyâre doggos. Puppies are puppers. And while not all puppers can be considered doggos, all doggos are most certainly puppers. Or woofers. Woofers that bork. If you want, you can boop a doggoâs snoot. That is - to lightly bop on oneâs nose. This is Loki, a very good dog When in mild distress, or sometimes just for emphasis, their chosen curse word is the ferociously aggressive ""heckin"". Oh, and if a dog sticks his or her tongue out a little bit? That's a blep. Like any new language, the best way to learn is to engross yourself in the culture - and one fine place that speaks fluent doggo is the happiest corner of the internet,Facebookâs Cool Dog Group (CDG),external. Here youâll find the likes ofIgor,external, who, let me tell you folks, is a born superstar, believe me. Igorâs just one of hundreds of puppers posted every week, a most welcome addition to news feeds that would otherwise be clogged up with baby pictures and wedding photos. Youâre welcome. âTheyâre good dogs, Brent.â Itâs the grassroots of doggo appreciation that has the movement set to make huge strides in 2017. Brant gets his comeuppance Itâs being spearheaded by Matt Nelson, a 20-year-old who studies golf course management in North Carolina, and a man described by serious newspaper Washington Post as ""the internetâs most famous dog rater"". Nelson runs theWeRateDogs account on Twitter,external. People submit dogs to be rated, and Nelson will consider the merits of said dog and provide a score out of 10. Recent scores: 12/10 for Hercules, 13/10 for Duchess and 14/10 for Sundance who, in a short clip,plays the drums,external. Late last year this generous but fair system was brought into disrepute by the user Brant, who questioned why all the dogs got such unfathomably high ratings. ""Theyâre good dogs, Brent,"" replied Nelson - anera-defining retort,externalwhich you can now buy on a hoodie. Or a mug. Since then, popularity has exploded. He now has over a million followers. ""We started up an e-commerce store,"" Matt tells me. ""We have a book deal. So many things I thought you could never do with just a Twitter account."" Therapy dogs You could say thereâs plenty of data out there to suggest that Iâm wrong, and that cats are still very much in control. And youâd be right - I found plenty evidence which completely disproves the theory Iâve outlined here, but Iâve left it out as I donât care. There wasone piece from Gizmodo in 2015,externalthat suggested there were scientific reasons to why cat memes were more popular online - but to that I say WRONG. Fake meows. Because the web is justdifferentnow. Looking at cat pictures was a way to waste time by mucking about on the internet. This is Zulu, a very good dog Now, like the therapy dogs of the real world, internet doggos are supplying a much needed diversion from the humourless drudgery that makes up much of the modern social web. ""Dogs are just a pure innocent thing,"" Matt Nelson says. ""They are the embodiment of unconditional love, and thatâs what people want now. ""I see my account as this refuge of something bright on the internet."" And so thatâs it. Sorry cats. You had a good run. Before publishing, my editor told me I was brave to write to this piece.

'A dressing room should never be silent',"This video can not be played Chapecoense survivor saw crash in dream Sirli Freitas took one, final phone call from her husband Cleberson Silva before he had to switch off his phone. ""There was so much background noise,"" she said. ""So much laughter and fun. ""I said, 'are you really on a plane, or in a bar?'"" Journalist Silva was on a plane that went down in the Andes on 29 November. He was one of 71 people who died along with almost the entire Chapecoense football team. The players were en route to the biggest match in the club's 43-year history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Colombia's Atletico Nacional. On Saturday, Chapecoense will play their first match since the crash - a friendly against defending Brazilian league champions Palmeiras. The people of Chapeco will, once-again, fill the small Arena Conda to see some of the 22 new players who make up the squad. Three of the six survivors were players, including central defender Neto, who was one of the team's leaders. He lay for six hours, trapped beneath the fuselage and trees, before being the last to be pulled out. Remarkably, he's already started walking without crutches. Sirli Freitas' husband died in the Andes plane crash ""I remember the lights went out suddenly, then I started praying, asking God to help us,"" he said. ""But a lot of people thought the plane was just landing, because it was not an abrupt fall. ""I remember the moment that I couldn't hear the plane engine anymore. It was just the wind, and then an alarm. ""But no-one got desperate, there was a lot of people praying. These are the last memories I have."" When Neto woke up in hospital, he was told he had been injured in the match because nobody knew quite how to break the news to him. But the truth dawned on him when there were no video clips of the match or evidence of his injury. Chapeco is a quiet, unassuming city with an air of settled contentment. Its population of about 209,553 is only slightly higher than the number of people who crammed into the Maracana Stadium to watch the 1950 World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil. But they form a tight-knit community, and a major part of that is the Chapecoense football team. Chapecoense plane crash timeline 29 November 2016:Chapecoense team in plane crash 3 December 2016:Fans unite for stadium memorial 5 December 2016:Team awarded Copa Sudamericana 26 December 2016:Colombia blames human error Club flags and signs adorn shops and bars all over the city. The relationship between citizens and club is one of mutual and humble respect and affection, according to 41-year-old Karina Dini. ""It was a strong bond, we were all a family,"" she said, sitting in the office of the language school she runs with her husband. ""There weren't any players who were going to parties or anything. Most of them were very committed. We could meet them in restaurants or the supermarket. ""It was amazing because players from the first division don't get that contact with people. They have big cars, they can't talk to people."" Like Karina, whose husband's uncle died in the crash, most people here know someone who was on the plane, or someone, like Sirli Freitas, who's been affected directly. ""My eight-year-old son understands [what happened], but his sister, who's three, still asks for her dad even though she knows he's not here any more,"" she said, through tears. ""If you ask her about him, she says that he was on the plane that crashed, but but at other times she'll say, 'let's call daddy'."" Outside the Arena Conda, there's a message to the world: ""We were looking for a word to say thanks for all the love we've received, and we found several."" Around the stadium, the streets have been painted green and white, in the club's colours. There has been a steady procession of press conferences, introducing some of the 22 new players. Rui Costa was brought in from Brazilian club Gremio and made director of football a week after the tragedy. This video can not be played Chapecoense: The day football wept Costa is adamant that Saturday's match is far more than a friendly. ""When I got here we had four players and a devastated dressing room. It was all about sadness and silence,"" he said. ""A dressing room should never be silent and here, it was. So we have accomplished our first goal - you can see a football team training here."" ""We had a list with 90 names that we were interested in,"" he said, as he explained how he assembled the squad in less than two months. ""We were choosing based on technical characteristics, then behaviour, then salary. ""We were working almost 24 hours a day because we knew it was not about just putting them on the pitch to play together. ""We had to respect the culture of the club. That's what they hired me for."" The last time the people of Chapeco went to the Arena Conda, it was on a day of torrential rain, to receive the bodies of their players, directors and journalists. On Saturday, they will return, to honour the city's fallen, and to meet their new family.

The improbable rise of Donald TrumpCompare 2009 and 20172:29How Obama spent his last dayObama crowd picture gaffe,"Long before making three consecutive bids for the US presidency, Donald Trump was America's most flamboyant billionaire. The New York real estate mogul's life was splashed all over tabloids and television in the decades leading up to his improbable 2015-16 run for the White House. His household name and unfiltered campaign style helped him defeat seasoned politicians - but a controversy-filled tenure saw him booted from office after a single term. Now 78, the Republican is again defying the odds as he mounts a stunning political comeback that could end with him back behind the president's desk in the Oval Office. He took the reins of the family business in 1971 Trump is the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to work the lowest-tier jobs within his father's company and was sent off to a military academy at age 13 when he started misbehaving in school. After earning a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, he became favoured to succeed his father when his older brother, Fred, chose to become a pilot. Fred Trump died at 43 from alcoholism, something that his brother says led him to avoid alcohol and cigarettes his entire life. He shifted the company's focus from Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan Trump says he got into real estate with a ""small"" $1m loan from his father before joining the company. He helped manage his father's extensive portfolio of residential housing projects in the New York City boroughs, and took control of the company - which he renamed the Trump Organization - in 1971. His father, who Trump describes as ""my inspiration"", died in 1999. His celebrity and media profile expanded with his business empire Under Trump, the family business shifted from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects. The famed Fifth Avenue became home to Trump Tower, arguably the mogul's most famous property and his home for many years. The rundown Commodore Hotel was restored as the Grand Hyatt. Other properties bearing the Trump brand name - casinos, condominiums, golf courses and hotels - were erected too, from Atlantic City, Chicago and Las Vegas to India, Turkey and the Philippines. His rise to stardom continued in the entertainment world - first as an owner of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants, then as creator-host of NBC reality show The Apprentice. He hosted 14 seasons of The Apprentice, a reality show that also featured his kids Over 14 seasons, as Apprentice contestants competed for a management contract in his business empire, his trademark ""You're fired!"" line made ""the Donald"" a household name. Trump has written several books, appeared in movies and pro-wrestling programming, and sold everything from beverages to neckties. But his net worth has dropped in recent years, with Forbes estimating he is currently worth around $4bn. Trump has also filed business bankruptcies on six separate occasions, and several of his ventures - including Trump Steaks and Trump University - have collapsed. He has also shielded his tax information from scrutiny, and reporting in 2020 from The New York Times revealed years of income tax avoidance and chronic financial losses. His marriage to and divorce from Ivana Zelnickova were the source of intense public interest Trump's personal life has received extensive publicity. His first, and arguably most famous, wife was Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. The couple had three children - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - before their divorce in 1990. Their acrimonious court battle made the front pages of gossip columns, and the late Mrs Trump's allegations of domestic abuse - which she later downplayed - feature in a new movie about Trump. He married actress Marla Maples in 1993, two months after the birth of their only child Tiffany. They divorced in 1999. He shares one son - Barron, 18 - with current wife Melania Trump Trump's current wife is former Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They married in 2005 and share a son, Barron William Trump, who recently turned 18. Allegations of sexual misconduct and extramarital affairs have followed Trump the politician. Earlier this year, two separate juries ruled that Trump defamed writer E Jean Carroll by denying her accusation of sexual assault. He was ordered to pay her $88m in total, but has appealed. Trump was also convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money arrangement with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels over an alleged extramarital encounter in 2006. In a 1980 interview, a 34-year-old Trump describes politics as ""a very mean life"" and says ""the most capable people"" instead choose the business world. By 1987 though, he began teasing a presidential bid. He briefly explored entering the 2000 race with the Reform Party, then again in 2012 as a Republican. Trump was among the most vocal proponents of ""birtherism"", the conspiracy theory questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US. He did not admit it was a lie until 2016 and never apologised. It all started with a ride down the golden escalator at Trump Tower It was not until June 2015 that Trump formally announced a bid for the White House, declaring the American Dream dead but promising to ""bring it back bigger and better"". The freewheeling address saw him flaunt his wealth and business success; accuse Mexico of sending drugs, crime and rapists to the US; and, promise to make the country pay for a border wall. Dominating displays on the debate stage and a controversy-riddled policy platform attracted adoring fans and fierce critics in equal measure, as well as a torrent of media attention. He dominated the 2015-16 Republican primary Under the 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan, he easily muscled past rivals in the Republican Party to face off against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The novice campaign was marred by controversy, including a leaked audio tape of him bragging about sexual abuse, and he trailed in opinion polls throughout the general election. But Trump had the last laugh against pundits and pollsters with his stunning victory over a veteran politician. He was sworn in as the country's 45th president on 20 January 2017. From the very first hours, he brought unrivalled drama to the job, often making formal announcements on Twitter (now X) and clashing openly with foreign leaders. The Trump presidency was an uncertain time for US allies He withdrew from major climate and trade agreements, banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, issued other tough immigration restrictions, launched a trade war with China, implemented record tax cuts, and reshaped Middle Eastern relations. For nearly two years, a special counsel probed alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. Thirty-four people faced criminal charges - on matters such as computer hacking and financial crimes - but not Trump. The investigation did not establish criminal collusion. Soon after, Trump became just the third US president in history to be impeached, over accusations he pressured a foreign government to dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden. He was impeached by a Democrat-led House of Representatives but acquitted in a Republican-led Senate. His 2020 election year was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. He faced intense criticism for his handling of the crisis as the US led the globe in deaths and infections and for controversial comments, like suggesting research into whether the virus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body. He was forced to take a break from the campaign trail in October after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 himself. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump on Covid-19 in his own words Though he eventually received 74 million votes - more than any other sitting US president - he lost the race to Mr Biden by more than seven million votes. From November 2020 to January 2021, he amplified claims of stolen votes and widespread electoral fraud - claims that were knocked down in more than 60 court cases. Refusing to accept the results, Trump rallied supporters in Washington on 6 January, urging them to converge on the Capitol as Mr Biden's victory was to be formally certified by Congress. That rally devolved into a riot that placed lawmakers and his own vice-president in danger and led to a historic second impeachment. Trump was again acquitted by the Senate, albeit more narrowly. His actions on the day are now the focus of two criminal cases. This video can not be played How Trump spent his last day as president Trump's political career appeared as good as dead after the storming of the Capitol. Donors and supporters vowed never to support him again, and even his closest allies publicly disavowed him. He skipped his successor's inauguration and moved his family to Florida but, with a loyal army of fans still behind him, retained massive influence over the Republican Party. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of his presidency came after it ended - when the three right-wing justices he had nominated to the Supreme Court cemented a conservative majority that helped end nearly 50 years of national abortion rights. Despite being blamed for poor Republican returns in the 2022 midterm elections, Trump announced another run for president and soon became his party's clear frontrunner. More than a dozen opponents, including his former vice-president, challenged him but fell short as Trump avoided the debate stage and trained his fire on Mr Biden. This video can not be played Watch: We asked MAGA: is there anything good about Biden? Trump began the general election facing 91 felony charges across four criminal cases but his strategy of delaying legal cases has largely succeeded. Three cases will now no longer take place before the election, and his sentencing in New York - on arguably the weakest set of charges - has been delayed until late November. On 13 July, a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds from an AR-style rifle from atop a nearby roof, wounding Trump in his right ear before the gunman was killed by counter-snippers. Days later, at the Republican National Convention, the party lavished him with praise on him and officially coronated him the Republican presidential candidate for a third consecutive time, setting up an apparent rematch with Mr Biden. A historically unpopular president, the Democrat's tenure has been marked by post-pandemic economic and infrastructure gains, but also high inflation, surges in illegal immigration and foreign policy chaos. Since Mr Biden stepped aside and endorsed his deputy, Kamala Harris, Trump has sought to tie her to the administration's failures - with middling success. National polls indicate that, while Ms Harris has galvanised liberal voters and raised millions of dollars, the race is deadlocked. He has told his supporters that 5 November 2024 - the date of the US election - will be ""the most important date in the history of our country"".

World v Trump on global climate deal?,"As a pro-coal president strides into the White House, the rest of the world is rallying in defence of the climate. Donald Trump has called climate change ""a hoax"" and filled his cabinet with representatives of fossil fuel industries. One of the world's leading climate scientists told me she was positively scared about his potential impact on the planet. But so far the leaders who joined with President Barack Obama in Paris in 2015 to sign the global climate deal are standing firm. As Mr Trump ponders pulling out of the UN climate deal, China, India, Germany, the EU and the UK have all reaffirmed their promise to curb CO2 emissions. And in the USA itself, moves have already been made to consolidate the low-carbon economy in a sign that fossil fuel companies will still face a battle over CO2 emissions, even with support from the White House. Only this week, China's President, Xi Jin Ping, warned Mr Trump that walking away from the Paris deal would endanger future generations. As Mr Trump promises to boost jobs by scrapping President Obama's clean energy plans, China is pushing on with a $361bn (Â£293bn) investment in renewable energy by 2020. China's Xie Zhenhua says the world will pressure the Trump administration over clean energy China's green aspirations are undermined by its expansion of coal-fired power stations, but this week it also suspended plans for 104 new coal plants. Xie Zhenhua, the veteran climate negotiator who forged a close partnership on clean energy between the two mega-powers,told China Daily,externalthat the global momentum behind low-carbon technology was unstoppable. He was quoted as saying: ""Industrial upgrades aiming for more sustainable growth is a global trendâ¦ it is not something that can be reversed by a single political leader. ""The international community and US citizens will pressurethe Trump administration,externalto continue clean energy policies."" Donald Trump win 'won't sway world on climate' Trump team moving away from supporters on climate science What does the Paris climate agreement mean for me? The State Department may not dismiss this flippantly: while US-Chinese relations may be increasingly frosty in many areas, climate change and clean energy remain a valuable sphere of co-operation. American politicians may also be wary of watching China seize the moral heights as world leader in tackling climate change. India is also standing firm. Its energy minister, Piyush Goyal, said this week: ""We respect the fact that America has chosen its leader. ""However, clean energy is not something that we are working on because somebody else wants us to do it - it's a matter of faith and the faith of the leadership in India. ""Nothing on Earth is going to stop us from doing that."" Solar energy prices are now on a par with coal in India, which boaststhe world's biggest solar farm and the first chemical plant to eat its own CO2 emissions. It will continue to expand coal-fired generation for the next few years, but its National Electricity Plan projects no further increase in coal-based capacity after 2022 - much earlier than previously suggested. India's Tuticorin plant is the world's first zero-emission chemical facility Dollars, technology and jobs will pour into clean energy in these countries, and the USA will surely be keen not to miss out. Meanwhile, moves are being made to consolidate President Obama's climate legacy. The US previously pledged $3bn to the UN's green fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change and get clean technology. Mr Trump won support among some voters for promising to stop payments and spend the cash on American citizens instead. But this week President Obamaslipped the fund a further $500m. And it won't just be on the international stage that Mr Trump's team will face fossil fuel battles. Some early skirmishes on American soil are already under way. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency cemented stricter efficiency standards for cars. Republicans will try to reverse this - but when carmakers previously resisted efficiency rules, they ended up producing such uncompetitive gas-guzzlers that the industry had to be bailed out. Even Republican plans to boost extraction of fossil fuels, while popular in some states because the industries create jobs, will provoke local resistance from people who don't want oil pipelines, or don't want the tops blown off their mountains to get to coal. It may be hard to persuade investors to put cash into coal anyway. Many states will resist fossil fuels, too. California has long led the way on car emissions and recently insisted it will keep its right to set its own tighter regulations for cars. Mr Trump's team may try to rescind this. The Paris climate agreement resulted in 195 nations pledging to reduce emissions There are already CO2 trading schemes between states on the east and west coasts, and last week New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to build enough offshore wind capacity by 2030 to power 1.25 million homes. Here's the big picture: as the world moves together to tackle climate change, it is clearly problematic if the biggest historic polluter threatens to pull in the opposite direction. Will Angela Merkel, for instance, be so sanguine about Germany's controversial switch to renewables if the US forces its already-low energy prices even lower, triggering protests from German industry? In the words of Jo Haigh, professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College, London: ""If Trump does what he said he'd do, and others follow suit, my gut feeling is that I'm scared. Very scared."" But he may not. And they may not.

"Could tuition fees really cost Â£54,000?","The last time tuition fees were increased there were waves of student protests How much will it cost to get a degree in England when tuition fees increase to Â£9,250 in the autumn? How about Â£54,000? If that seems high for a three-year degree, that's how much a think tank has calculated a student could have to pay back with interest. And that wouldn't be the full size of the debt. There could be another Â£40,000 still outstanding when fee loans are written off after 30 years. When fees start increasing from this autumn, it will mean borrowing about Â£28,600 for three years, with the amount then rising with inflation each year. But while students have battled for years over the headline figure of Â£9,000 and now Â£9,250, the Intergenerational Foundation says they're missing the much bigger picture of what it will really cost in repayments. And it's going to publish its findings in a report called The Packhorse Generation. These extra costs start to rack up while a student is still at university, because interest is charged as soon as students start their courses, adding thousands to the debt before students have even graduated. Students pay back fee loans from their earnings after graduation Students start paying back their fee loans once they earn more than Â£21,000 per year - and the more they earn the more they pay each month, until the debt, plus interest, is cleared. So this means total repayments can vary widely. The think tank, which campaigns for fairness between generations, forecasts that: A graduate earning Â£41,000 would pay back Â£54,000 on their tuition fee loan. And after 30 years, a further Â£38,900 would still be outstanding. A higher paid graduate - earning Â£50,000 per year - would earn enough to clear all their tuition fee debts within 30 years and would have repaid about Â£57,000. For someone earning Â£35,000, repayments would cost Â£37,800, with Â£55,000 to be written off after 30 years. A more likely scenario is that a graduate would start on a lower salary and gradually progress upwards. And the think tank gives an example of someone starting out on Â£22,000 and then rising over the years to Â£41,000, with the projection that they would pay back about Â£31,000 and leave a further Â£69,000 unpaid. These are not necessarily bad deals for students if it helps them into a good career. But Estelle Clarke, a former City lawyer on the advisory board of the Intergenerational Foundation, argues that we're failing to understand the ""stranglehold"" of debt that we're building up for young people. She also warns we should be looking nervously at the vast scale of write-offs in the current system. Would the sell-off of student loans mean tougher terms? At present the taxpayer picks up the tab for unpaid loans after 30 years, allowing graduates to walk away from tens of thousands of pounds of debt and interest charges. ""Taxpayers end up paying for this system twice over. Firstly, they will shoulder the burden of an economy deprived of cash as millions of graduates' incomes are diverted to loan repayments,"" says Ms Clarke. ""And secondly, they shoulder the burden of the non-repayment of most loans due to the extortionate ratcheting up of interest in spite of regular payments made."" But the government has long considered selling off more of the student loan book to the private financial sector. Would a private operator, looking hungrily at monthly repayments from millions of graduates, want more favourable terms and a bigger slice of that unpaid debt? Ms Clarke warns that there is not nearly enough protection for students against future changes to repayment arrangements to ""extract even more cash from graduates' pockets"". ""No other lending has so little protection,"" she says. New York plans to offer free tuition to middle-income families By international standards, the only real comparison for such levels of student borrowing is the United States. But as England is increasing the cost of tuition, the US has been trying to reverse out of a spiral of higher fees and higher debt. This month the governor of New York announced a plan to scrap tuition fees at state universities and colleges for families earning up to $125,000 (Â£102,000) per year, which would help 80% of households. It reflected deep-seated middle class anxieties about student debt - especially for families not rich enough to afford the fees and not poor enough to get financial support. This really can be a lifetime of debt, with warnings this month of aggressive tactics from lenders trying to recover student loans from pensioners, with the over-60s in the US still owing Â£55bn of student debt. Under the Obama administration there had been growing efforts to tackle student debt. But with the election of President Trump the future of student loans, now measured in the trillions, has become much less predictable. The Department for Education argues that England's system is already extremely accessible, because there are no upfront costs for any students. Instead the costs are backloaded to be paid after graduates are working. And since graduates are likely to earn more, they can afford the cost of repayments, which in turn supports the next generation of students. ""The English system of student funding is sustainable, and has been recognised as such by the OECD,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman. ""Critically, our system removes financial barriers for anyone hoping to study - with record numbers of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university last year."" But this is something of a turning point - with fees and debts about to begin a long upward curve. And the Intergenerational Foundation's warnings cast a cold light on the scale of the escalating costs. Will this be the next stage of a sophisticated, self-funding, open-access, affordable university system, or unwitting steps towards a financial sinkhole?

Picasso prints go on show in Barnsley,"Pablo Picasso visited South Yorkshire in 1950 for an international peace conference An exhibition of original prints by world-renowned artist Pablo Picasso are to go on show at a museum in Barnsley. The 17 linocut prints are on display from Saturday at a free exhibition at the town's Cooper Gallery. The valuable prints are out on loan from the British Museum and were previously on display at the Lady Lever Art Gallery near Liverpool. Barnsley-born Ian Macmillan has written a poem about a previous visit by the artist to South Yorkshire. Mr Macmillan was inspired by Picasso's visit to Sheffield in 1950 for an international peace conference. Live updates from this and more Yorkshire stories The Spanish artist is acknowledged to be one of the most important artists of the 20th Century. He experimented with a wide range of styles and themes in his long career, most notably inspiring Cubism. The prints are on loan from the British Museum for the first time Picasso experimented with a wide range of styles and themes in his long career, most notably inspiring Cubism The artworks at the gallery include prints showing the development of key Picasso prints including Jacqueline Reading that depicts the artist's wife, Jacqueline Roque.
