Trump-Kim summit set for Singapore,"This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts US President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June, he has said. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" the US leader tweeted. In March, Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim for an unprecedented sit-down. The pair had previously exchanged insults and threats. The breakthrough came after landmark talks between North and South Korea. Mr Trump's announcement came hours after he welcomed home three US detainees released by North Korea. Their release came during a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. How does North Korea's Kim Jong-un travel? Trump greets men freed by North Korea The political gamble of the 21st Century No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. The White House said the American trio were freed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the summit, which Mr Trump earlier said he thought would be a ""big success"". ""I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful,"" he said. The key issue expected to be discussed is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme - over which Mr Trump and Mr Kim furiously sparred in 2017. The communist North has carried out six nuclear tests since 2006, despite international condemnation and sanctions, saying it needs the weapons for its own security. The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly. Ahead of the meeting,Mr Kim has pledged to stop nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches, and also to shut down a nuclear test site. But analysts caution that Mr Kim is unlikely to easily abandon nuclear weapons that he has pushed so hard to obtain, and that ""denuclearisation"" means something quite different to both sides. There has been no word from Pyongyang on what it might specifically offer at the summit, but key issues for the North will be the presence of 30,000 US military personnel in South Korea, and the lifting of sanctions that are choking the economy. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained At a summit in April, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, although the means of achieving this were not detailed and previous such pledges have been abandoned. Still, the dramatic meeting - which saw a North Korean leader setting foot on South Korean soil for the first time since the end of the 1953 Korean War - marked a historic breakthrough between the two countries.

In 2015, the leaders of China and Taiwan held historic talks in the South East Asian city-state, their first in more than 60 years. It had been seen by top US officials as a good, neutral choice for the Trump-Kim talks. North Korea crisis in 300 words The US and Singapore have a close relationship. Singapore has diplomatic ties with North Korea but suspended all trade with the country in November last year as international sanctions were tightened.

"Scientist David Goodall, 104, ends his life","This video can not be played ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it"" Scientist David Goodall, 104, has died after choosing to end his life at a clinic in Switzerland, a right-to-die organisation says. The lauded London-born ecologist and botanist, who was not terminally ill, said the decision had been driven by his deteriorating quality of life. Mr Goodall had flown from Australia for his assisted suicide, attracting the attention of people around the world. Shortly before his death, he said he was ""happy to end"" his life. ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it,"" he said, surrounded by several family members. ""All the publicity that this has been receiving can only, I think, help the cause of euthanasia for the elderly, which I want."" The admired scientist who wanted a say in how his life ended The academic died ""peacefully"" at 12:30 (10:30 GMT) at the Life Cycle clinic in Basel, from an infusion of Nembutal, a barbiturate, said Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, the group which helped him take his own life. He was visibly frustrated by the process of formal paperwork, and Mr Nitschke later said: ""In fact his last words were 'This is taking an awfully long time!'"" Mr Goodall's last meal was his favourite - fish and chips and cheesecake - and in his final minutes he was played Ode to Joy from Beethoven's 9th symphony. Mr Goodall had lived on his own in a small flat in Perth, Western Australia, until only a few weeks before his trip to Switzerland. He stepped back from full-time employment in 1979, but remained heavily involved in his field of work. This video can not be played David Goodall, 104, sets out his reasons for travelling to Switzerland to voluntarily end his life Among his achievements in recent years, Mr Goodall edited a 30-volume book series called Ecosystems of the World and was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his scientific work. In 2016, aged 102, he won a battle to keep working on campus at Perth's Edith Cowan University, where he was an unpaid honorary research associate. Mr Goodall said he resented having to leave Australia to end his life. Assisted dying is legal in only one state, but eligibility requires a person to be terminally ill. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is strongly opposed to assisted dying, which it sees as an unethical practice of medicine. Meanwhile, Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Mr Goodall arrived in Basel on Monday after visiting relatives in France, and spent his final full day exploring the Basel University botanic gardens with three of his grandchildren. What different countries say about assisted dying At a press conference on Wednesday, he said he was surprised by the public interest in his case. He added: ""I no longer want to continue life. ""One wants to, at my age, even rather less than my age... to be free to choose death when the death is at an appropriate time."" He wanted no funeral and requested that his body be donated to medicine or his ashes sprinkled locally, Exit International said. Assisted suicide describes any act that intentionally helps another person kill themselves, for example by providing them with the means to do so, most commonly by prescribing a lethal medication. It differs from euthanasia, which is a third-party intervention to end a life to relieve suffering, such as when a doctor administers the lethal dose. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is allowed only if the person assisting acts unselfishly. It is the only country with centres offering assisted suicide to foreign nationals The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg permit euthanasia and assisted suicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is available to minors in specific instances Colombia allows euthanasia The US states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, California, Colorado and Hawaii permit assisted dying for terminally ill patients. The US capital Washington DC implemented a similar law for the city's residents in 2017 Canada followed the province of Quebec in permitting euthanasia and assisted suicide in 2016 Australian scientist, 104, ends life 'happy' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Number of middle-aged renters doubles,"This video can not be played Paul McKay: 'It's just going to be renting until I die' Forty-somethings are now almost twice as likely to be renting from a private landlord than they were 10 years ago. Rising UK house prices have left many middle-age workers unable to afford a first home, or as ""accidental renters"" after a relationship break-up. Analysts say a focus on young first-time buyers means older tenants, often with children, risk being ignored. Concerns have been raised about the economic and social impact of these tenants in future years. Data analysed for and by BBC News shows: The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years since 2006-07, according to theFamily Resources Survey,externalby the Department for Work and Pensions Renting among all age groups is now more likely to be from a private landlord than from a council or housing association A particular rise in renting among 45 to 50-year-olds, sometimes as a result of death, debt or divorce, analysis for the BBC shows Single parents with children who rent are a major concern among debt charities ""The danger of all this is the social inequality it will create between the haves - who are homeowners - and the have nots,"" said Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners' Alliance. Richard Donnell, from property market analysts Hometrack, who studied the data for BBC News, pointed to the potential strain on the benefits system in 15 to 20 years' time when some of these tenants require financial assistance topay the rent during retirement,external. 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Tenants' tales - in five charts Renting and house-sharing is a necessity for some - like Paul McKay, who has moved between a dozen rental properties in 20 years. The 44-year-old retail worker, who lives in Kingston, Greater London, says that buying a home had previously felt out of reach, and now was completely off the radar. ""If I could go back in time, I would tell myself that the housing market might seem crazy now, but it is going to get crazier,"" he says. Years ago, he decided that when prices breached Â£100,000 for a two-bedroom house, buying a property was too much of a risk. ""I know that now I'm ageing myself out of a mortgage, which is a slight concern. I don't feel I should be owed anything, but there is no support for my demographic, and there is still a stigma attached to renting in this country."" Lesley Steele says that renting has given her some freedom However, renting in middle-age is a more attractive option for some people. Lesley Steele, 51, lives in a converted pub in Cumbria which she shares with a housemate of similar age. ""I've always done a lot of travelling and did not want to be tied down paying a mortgage,"" she says. She generally works on short contracts in the education sector, and moved to Cumbria for the lifestyle and surroundings. ""I've never wanted to settle down and have kids. It would be lovely to have a base, but I prefer my freedom. The idea of a mortgage is scary, even now."" She says she has savings so she will not face a financial ""crisis"" if she is left without a job, but has no long-term contingency plan. Record numbers of families are in rented accommodation and charities say there is a significant impact on the continuity of family and financial life. Research by housing charity Shelter said two-thirds of private renters with families who it surveyed said they wished their children did not have to live in a privately rented home. A fifth had moved from one rented home to another in the past five years, potentially affecting travel and schooling. One in six had been asked to move by the landlord. Debt charity StepChange said that four in five of those seeking help for unmanageable debts were tenants. Many were single parents. Most found themselves struggling with debts following a financial shock such as divorce or redundancy, rather than poor budgeting. Mrs Higgins described many of those leaving long-term relationships as ""accidental renters"". ""People are stretched to the limit and have insecure wages. When they split up, a couple can't each buy a property in the same area that lets them share the children,"" she said. In the 10 years to April 2017, the proportion of people renting their home from a private landlord increased across all working age groups, the latest figures show. At the same time the proportion of homeowners with a mortgage fell among those of working age. Overall, 20% of UK households were renting privately by 2017, compared to 28% who own with a mortgage, according to theFamily Resources Survey,externalby the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Of the rest, 34% own their home outright and 17% are in the social renting sector. Your six pros and cons of renting a home Sex and dating when you live with your parents Reality Check: Are we spending more money on rent? Since the start of the decade, there has been a greater proportion who pay rent to a private landlord than social housing tenants. Nearly half of 25 to 34-year-olds rented their home privately by 2017, but the largest increase over the 10 years during and after the financial crisis were 35 to 44-year-olds. The proportion of private renters in this age group doubled from 13% to 26%. The proportion of 45 to 54-year-olds renting from a private landlord rose from 8% to 14% over the same period. BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living.Join the Affordable Living group here,external. A recentreport by the Resolution Foundationsuggested that up to a third of young people face living in private rented accommodation all their lives. It called for more affordable homes for first-time buyers to be built, as well as better protection for those who rent, and said the tax system should be changed to discourage second-home ownership. It also suggested ""light touch"" stabilisation policies to limit rent increases to the rate of inflation over a three-year period. But one landlords' trade body said any kind of rent control would be a disaster for the sector. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Teen girl 'plotted British Museum attack',"Safaa Boular was ""sincere and determined"" in her intentions, prosecutors said A teenage girl plotted a gun and grenade attack at the British Museum after her attempts to become a jihadi bride were thwarted, a court has heard. Safaa Boular was 17 when she allegedly decided to be a ""martyr"" after her Islamic State fighter fiancÃ© was killed in Syria, the Old Bailey was told. Ms Boular, now 18, denies two counts of preparing acts of terrorism. Her sister Rizlaine Boular, 21, has admitted planning an attack with knives in Westminster. She was given assistance and support by her mother, Mina Dich, the jury was told. Mina Dich (left) provided assistance and support to her daughter Rizlaine Boular, court heard Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said Safaa Boular, who lived with her mother in Vauxhall, London, wanted to ""unleash violence and terror in the heart of London"". But Joel Bennathan QC, representing Ms Boular, said the teenager had been ""sexually groomed"" and ""groomed to be radicalised"" online by IS fighter Naweed Hussain. He said her family had ""encouraged"" and ""celebrated"" it. Mr Atkinson said she declared her love for Hussain in August 2016 after three months of chatting on social media. The prosecutor told jurors she wanted to join Hussain in Syria where they would wear suicide belts and, in Hussain's words, ""depart the world holding hands and taking others with them"". The court heard Rizlaine Boular had also tried to go to Syria two years before. After Safaa Boular's plan was uncovered, she allegedly switched her attention to Britain, contacting Hussain by phone through encrypted Telegram chat. But British security services had deployed officers to engage in online communication with the pair, jurors heard. Mr Atkinson said: ""It was clear that Hussain had been planning an act of terrorism with Safaa Boular in which she could engage if she remained in this country. Both Hussain and Safaa Boular talked of a planned ambush involving grenades and or firearms."" She also told an officer posing as an IS fighter that all she needed was a ""car and a knife to get what I want to achieve"", the court heard. Mr Atkinson said: ""Based on her preparation and discussion, it appears she planned to launch an attack against members of the public selected largely at random in the environs of that cultural jewel and most popular of tourist attractions, the British Museum in central London."" An attack would have created at least ""widespread panic"" and was intended to cause injury and death, it was claimed. When she learned Hussain had been killed in April 2017, Ms Boular's determination was strengthened, the court heard. But within days, she was charged with planning to go to Syria so was unable to carry out her ""chilling intentions"", the prosecutor said. He said: ""That those intentions were not just chilling but sincere and determined is demonstrated by the fact that she did not abandon them even when she was unable to put them into effect herself. ""Rather, she sought to encourage her sister Rizlaine to carry the torch forward in her stead."" In calls to her sister from jail, Safaa Boular referenced an Alice in Wonderland-themed tea party which was code for an attack, the court heard. Mr Atkinson told jurors the older sibling had admitted preparing acts of terrorism. Rizlaine Boular spent three days carrying out reconnaissance of major landmarks in Westminster and bought knives and a rucksack, the court heard. Based on her reconnaissance and discussion, it appears she planned a knife attack in Westminster, Mr Atkinson said. She was arrested on 27 April last year, the day of the planned attack, the court heard. Safaa Boular's trial continues.

Weinstein's wife 'never' suspected,"Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman have been married since 2007 Harvey Weinstein's estranged wife has given her first interview since he was engulfed in scandal, and said she was ""never"" suspicious about his behaviour. Asked by Vogue magazine whether she had suspicions, fashion designer Georgina Chapman replied: ""Absolutely not."" The interview comes seven months after the first of dozens of women accused him of sexual assault and harassment. Chapman admitted she had been ""so naive"", and was ""so humiliated and so broken"" when the scandal unfolded. Weinstein and Chapman married in 2007 andshe announced that she was leaving himdays after the allegations emerged. Vogue described him as her ""soon-to-be ex-husband"". The movie mogul has denied all allegations of ""non-consensual sex"". The British designer, who founded the Marchesa label, said she didn't go out in public for five months after the story broke. Georgina Chapman: ""I had what I thought was a very happy marriage"" ""I was so humiliated and so broken that I didn't think it was respectful to go out,""she told US Vogue,external. ""I thought, 'who am I to be parading around with all of this going on?'. It's still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped. It was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs."" The couple have two children, who are aged seven and five. She said: ""There was a part of me that was terribly naive - clearly, so naive. ""I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief. And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be?"" Vogue said she broke down in loud sobs during the interview. ""What are people going to say to them? It's like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can't bear it for them."" Scarlett Johansson wore Marchesa to the Met Gala Chapman said she lost 10lb in five days after the first allegations emerged because she ""couldn't keep food down"". She said: ""My head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I'd ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn't make an informed decision. ""And then the stories expanded and I realised that this wasn't an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here."" With the children, she went to stay with actor David Oyelowo, a longtime friend. ""I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life,"" she said. Weinstein was ""a wonderful partner"", Chapman said, adding: ""He was a friend and a confidant and a supporter. Yes, he's a big personality... but... I don't know. I wish I had the answers. But I don't."" Scarlett Johansson was the first celebrity in months to wear Marchesa at a high-profile event when she wore one of the firm's creations to the Met Ball on Monday.

The strikes came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights overnight. Syria's military said the Israeli ""aggression"" had killed three people. There was no immediate comment from Iran, whose deployment of troops to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad has alarmed Israel. Iran has repeatedly called for an end to the existence of the Jewish state. Russia, Germany and France called on both countries to exercise restraint, but the US said Iran bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions"" and that Israel had a right to defend itself. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts there by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, confirmed that rockets were fired towards the occupied Golan. But it said the attack came after Israeli forces bombarded Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone. Israeli forces in the occupied Golan Heights have been on high alert since Tuesday night A senior source in an Iranian-led military alliance that supports Syria's government also told AFP news agency that Israeli forces had fired first. Col Conricus said fighter jets had struck 70 military targets belonging to Iran inside Syria, causing significant damage. The targets included: Intelligence sites associated with Iran and its proxies A logistics headquarters belonging to the Quds Force A military logistics compound in Kiswah, a town south of Damascus An Iranian military compound north of Damascus Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport Intelligence systems and posts associated with the Quds Force Observation and military posts and munitions in the Golan demilitarised zone The IDF said it had also targeted Syrian military air defence systems after they fired at the fighter jets despite an Israeli ""warning"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman later told a conference in the town of Herzliya that the IDF had ""hit almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"". ""They must remember that if it rains here [in Israel], it will pour there,"" he said. ""I hope that we have finished this chapter and that everyone got the message."" Israel's defence minister said it had ""no interest in escalation"" following the strikes However, Syria's military declared it had ""thwarted a new Israeli act of aggression"" and that its air defences ""destroyed a large part"" of the missile barrage. Three people were killed by the missiles, a spokesman said. A radar station and an ammunition depot were also destroyed, and several air defence bases sustained damage, he added. Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained The Syrian Observatory reported that at least 23 people were killed, including five Syrian soldiers and 18 other allied fighters. Russia, which is also supporting the Syrian military, said Israel fired 60 air-to-surface and 10 surface-to-surface missiles and that more than half were shot down. By Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent, BBC News These events have tactical and strategic dimensions. In the short-term the Iranians are seeking ""pay back"" for an Israeli strike against one of their bases in Syria a little over a month ago. On Wednesday night, according to the Israeli military, Iran's Quds Force launched rockets against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. But the scale of the attack was limited - a single multiple-barrel rocket launcher appears to have been used, which the Israelis say they subsequently destroyed. They then apparently hit every Iranian facility they know of in Syria to send a powerful message to Tehran. But neither Israel nor Iran appear to want an all-out war at this stage. Nonetheless their strategic rivalry is clear. Tehran is seeking to establish itself as a military player in Syria to open up another potential front against Israel. And Israel is equally determined to prevent this. Will there be a war between Israel and Iran? Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are determined to stop what they consider Iranian ""military entrenchment"" in the country. Iran has deployed hundreds of troops, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. This video can not be played Tzipi Hotovely: Iran should 'stay away' from Syria Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Mr Netanyahu's lobbying against the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which US President Donald Trump abandoned on Tuesday, has raised tensions further with Tehran. Mr Lieberman stressed that while Israel had ""no interest in escalation"", it had to ""be prepared for any scenario"". ""We are facing a new reality where Iran is attacking Israel directly and trying to harm Israel's sovereignty and territories,"" he added. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

Inquiry into recall of neurology patients,"More than 2,500 patients have been recalled following a case review by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust An independent inquiry has been set up to reviewthe recall of more than 2,500 neurology patients by the Belfast Health Trust. The recall was announced last week after an examination of the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease and Motor Neurone Disease. The Department of Health announced earlier that the inquiry panel will be chaired by barrister Brett Lockhart QC. What we know about the recall General Medical Council investigation underway Concerns about potential misdiagnoses of Dr Watt's patientswere formally raised in December 2016 by a GP. The inquiry will examine the actions taken by the Belfast Trust after concerns were raised and whether or not there were grounds for ""earlier intervention"". Melissa McCullough, a non-executive director for the Health and Social Care Board NI, who made an official complaint after Dr Watt incorrectly diagnosed her with multiple sclerosis (MS) instead of neurological Lyme disease in 2010, said on Friday she hoped the inquiry would build ""some trust in the system"". ""I am just concerned that we get to the bottom of what the issue is, whether it is systemic or not systemic,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. ""Whether the Belfast Trust could have done everything right, we don't know. ""I think that is why the inquiry is so vitally important, because I think that will go some way in helping to understand what went wrong, but hopefully be building some trust in the system."" Louise Skelly, head of operations at Patient and Client Council (Northern Ireland), has welcomed the inquiry and said it was important that the complaints process was in the terms of reference. ""I think it is important that they are looking at how lessons can be learned from this exercise and in particular how lessons can be learned from the complaints process,"" she said. ""Contrary to popular opinion, people are very reluctant to complain and when they do so they should be reassured that they are listened to, taken seriously, and that lessons are genuinely learned."" This inquiry reflects the seriousness of the neurology crisis.  It also reflects the differing and conflicting accounts we have been hearing from the public and doctors. Questions have been raised about patients being misdiagnosed as far back as 10 years ago - and not just in a couple of cases. Questions are also being asked about why the warning signs were not picked up sooner by the Belfast Trust. Doctors don't work in isolation. Neurology is a speciality where in the health trust just 10 consultants worked together. There are regular meetings held between specialists especially over complex cases. Why, it will be asked, were they not aware of concerns regarding Dr Watt? And if and when concerns were raised did management act quickly enough? Post 2016 and the Harold Shipman Inquiry, the General Medical Council reported that doctors should adhere to a strict annual appraisal system. That should include doctors being assessed and their caseload reviewed. Problematic cases and any concerns should be discussed and reviewed. The inquiry panel will endeavour to find out if this was happening. Meanwhile patients will wait. Department of Health permanent secretary, Richard Pengelly, said: ""The focus since last week has rightly been on establishing a robust patient recall process. That remains the first priority. ""However, it is clear that a rigorous review is also required - given the seriousness of the situation and the impact on patients. The public needs to be assured that this issue has been properly and appropriately handled by the trust, and that any lessons for the future are learned."" Some patients included in the major neurology recall say theirappointments have been changed at short notice. The trust said ""the vast majority"" of appointments will go ahead as planned. Patients have also said they have not been getting adequate aftercare and counselling after attending recall clinics over the last few days. The trust said: ""We know this is an anxious time for patients and while there are opportunities at clinics to speak to trust staff, we recognise the need to offer additional counselling and we are working hard to address this."" In addition to Thursday's announcement, the Department of Health has asked the Regulation Quality and Improvement Authority (RQIA) to review the records of all patients or former patients of Dr Watt who have died over the past 10 years. Welcoming the inquiry, the SDLP's Nichola Mallon said: ""Patients and their families, and the general public, will be relieved to see that the department has stepped up. ""It is absolutely vital that this review establishes exactly how this was allowed to happen and what changes are required to prevent the possibility of this happening again.""

Harry comrades 'nervous' for wedding role,"The soldiers have been rehearsing for the big day Prince Harry's ex-Army comrades have spoken of their nerves at being given a ceremonial role at his wedding to Meghan Markle. Some of the soldiers who trained and served with Harry will have ""pride of place"" outside St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. More than 250 members of the armed forces will perform ceremonial duties at the 19 May wedding. Prince Harry was an Apache helicopter pilot in Afghanistan in 2012.

Prince Harry flew Apache helicopters in Afghanistan in 2012 Capt William Calder, 32, who will lead his soldiers in a royal salute, said he reacted with ""stunned surprise"" when he was told he would be going. He said: ""It makes me a little bit nervous that we will be front and centre - the Queen and the senior members of the royal family will be stepping out the door right beside us."" The officer said his family are ""pretty excited"". Capt William Calder will lead the troops at the wedding Capt Calder said his only meeting with the prince was at a cafe at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, when Harry asked if he could join the officer's table. He said: ""I knew he looked familiar, finally it dawned on me it was Prince Harry and of course he was utterly natural and charming and friendly and just like any other officer in the regiment."" Preparations are well under way at Windsor Castle Cpl Stuart Armstrong, 27, a communications specialist who worked with the prince ""day-to-day"" during Apache training, said it was an ""honour"" to be nominated and the soldiers had been busy preparing.

PC 'affair' claims stalled fox hunt probe,"The video filmed covertly by anti-hunt activities allegedly shows a terrierman carrying a fox cub into a shed housing hunting hounds A police inquiry into the alleged killing of fox cubs by hunting hounds stalled for nearly two years while the officer in charge was himself investigated, the BBC can reveal. West Mercia PC Richard Barradale-Smith has now been cleared of the allegations against him - including that he had had affairs with anti-hunting activists. At least one claim was made by somebody with links to the hunt in the case. Police have now said five people are to be charged with animal cruelty. Three men and one woman aged between 29 and 54 will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court next week. In May 2016, activists from the Hunt Investigation Teamused hidden cameras to film a South Herefordshire Hunt terriermanapparently taking the young foxes into a shed of barking hounds before emerging with their lifeless bodies. The anti-hunting activists believe the terriermen were training the dogs to see foxes as prey. PC Richard Barradale-Smith has previously investigated allegations made by animal rights campaigners The footage and the bodies of two cubs were handed to PC Barradale-Smith who had investigated previous allegations made by animal rights campaigners. But West Mercia Police then began an investigation into the officer after receiving an allegation that PC Barradale-Smith had been in a relationship with two anti-hunting activists, including the woman who brought him the evidence. This would have been misconduct in public office. Police searched both his house and that of the anti-hunting activist, who has asked the BBC not to use her name. Anonymous threatening letters were sent to another woman who has campaigned against fox-hunting, also accusing her of having an affair with the officer. She passed them to the police. The person who made the allegation works in the farming community and has close links to the South Herefordshire Hunt. He is not one of those charged. The BBC understands he did not name the officer and told the force he did not want to get further involved. Anti-hunt investigators said the foxes were alive in a cage before later being filmed lifeless Mr Barradale-Smith's family believes it was a ""smear campaign"" aimed at disrupting the case. Further allegations against the officer were made in October 2016 by a senior prosecutor who said PC Barradale-Smith had leaked confidential information to the activist who gave him the video evidence. He was also accused of bombarding the CPS with emails. This triggered a separate misconduct investigation and he was taken off the fox cubs case. In January 2017, the officer went on sick leave and is yet to return to work. By March this year both investigations had been resolved and he has been cleared of any wrong-doing. Now, within weeks, the decision to prosecute has been taken, two years after the investigation began. The video allegedly shows a hunt worker taking foxes out of a cage in a lorry and into the home of the hounds The Hunt Investigation Team described the force's response as a scandal and claimed the police seemed more interested in ""harassing"" the officer who investigated the allegations than examining the allegations themselves. The activist alleged to have been involved with the PC asked to remain anonymous but said: ""The police are there to investigate without fear or favour when evidence of a crime is brought to their attention."" ""For two years they've been investigating an unsubstantiated allegation that I had an affair with a police officer that I've met once. It would have been very easy to show that was completely false and what you would have expected West Mercia to do is say, given the source, 'is there a conflict of interest here'."" In a joint statement, West Mercia Police and the CPS said the fox cub inquiry had involved a number of ""complex factors"". The force refused to comment about PC Barradale-Smith.

Bank holds rates as UK hits 'soft patch',"This video can not be played Mark Carney says the UK economy will pick up The Bank of England said the UK economy has hit a ""temporary soft patch"" as it kept interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The Bank cut its growth forecast for the year to 1.4%, down from the forecast of 1.8% made in February. The Bank says that cut is almost entirely due to the disruption to the economy caused by bad weather in March. However, Bank governor Mark Carney said in an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed that ""it's likely"" rates will rise this year. In a press conference after the rates decision was announced, Mr Carney said the ""underlying pace of growth remains more resilient than the headline data suggests"". As recently as February economists were expecting the Bank to raise interest rates this month. That view changed after figures released last month showed that the economy grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of the year. The slowdown was caused by the Beast from the East - severe weather which shut down construction sites, kept shoppers at home and caused transport chaos. However, the Bank described that as a ""temporary soft patch"" with ""few implications"" for the outlook for the economy. The financial markets are now indicating there will be an interest rate increase towards the end of the year followed by another in 2019, and a further one in 2020. Live reaction to the Bank's decision What would a rate rise mean for me? UK economy in weakest growth since 2012 UK inflation falls to lowest in a year Movements in the Bank's official rates can have big effects on UK households. A rise would mean that about four million households with variable or tracker rate mortgages would see an increase in their monthly payments, while an increase would benefit the nation's 45 million savers. Mr Carney sets interest rates with a team of eight other experts that form the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). At the latest meeting, seven members voted to keep interest rates on hold and two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, voted for an increase. ""It looks like the 2018 rate hike has been delayed not cancelled,"" Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said. However, former MPC member Andrew Sentance said the Bank had ""totally misunderstood"" the economic slowdown. He said persistent low interest rates and uncertainty over their future direction were undermining the pound and hurting consumers by causing inflation. Is Mr Carney revealing once again his ""unreliable boyfriend"" tendencies, promising that interest rate rises are just around the corner, only to pull back? He might suggest that he and the other eight members of the MPC are less the unreliable partners, more the ""sensitive"" listeners. Sensitive to changes in the data which effect a decision based on fine margins and delicate judgements. It was John Maynard Keynes who said that when the facts changed, so, sir, did he. Today the Bank has changed tone. Let's wait and see, it is saying. Let's wait and see how the economy develops until we give any firm guidance on the path of interest rates  beyond the Bank's often used formulation of some limited rises ""over the forecast period"" of the next three years. Yes, they will rise at some point. But the chances of that happening sooner rather than later has receded. Read Kamal's blog in full The minutes from the meeting show the MPC wants to wait and see how the economy performs over the coming months. While they expect it to recover from a weak start to the year, there is a risk that the slowdown could be more persistent. The Office for National Statistics appears to be more pessimistic than the Bank of England. The ONS released data today showing that industrial production expanded just 0.1% in March from February. It said the economy was ""sluggish"" in the first quarter, but said the bad weather had ""little impact overall"", suggesting it thinks the economy has underlying problems. Later on Thursday, in an interview with the BBC's economics editor, Mr Carney said: ""It's likely over the course of the next year rates will go up... that's the most likely thing to happen."" But any rate rises would be at a ""gentle pace"", the governor said. He added that there could be shocks to the UK economy from protectionist trade policies or from Brexit, in which case: ""If the economy slows... then we will adjust policy."" The course of interest rates depends on inflation falling in line with the Bank's expectations. In March, inflation was running at an annual rate of 2.5%, which is above the Bank's target of 2%. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? But in its most recentQuarterly Inflation Report,external, the Bank blames above-target inflation on higher prices of imported goods caused by a weaker pound. The Bank expects that effect to fade over the coming years, bringing inflation back to 2% by early 2021. It also forecast that the unemployment rate would fall further, to 4% by 2020, the Bank's lowest forecast since the financial crisis. Is Carney an unreliable boyfriend - or just sensitive?

'Dismay' over undercover police probe delay,"The inquiry being held at the High Court has already attracted criticism from campaigners Campaigners have been left ""dismayed"" after it was revealed the public inquiry into undercover policing will not deliver its final report until at least 2023. Theinquirywas launched in 2015, has already cost about Â£10m and was originally due to finish this year. It is investigating undercover operations in England and Wales since 1968 after a string of allegations of wrong-doing by officers. Unite said justice was ""being denied"". Gary Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the union, said the government needs to explain the delays. The union is involved in the inquiry as Ucatt (now a part of Unite) was allegedly infiltrated by an undercover officer. Can inquiry get to the truth? Why does the inquiry matter? He said: ""Victims of undercover policing have had their lives wrecked and yet they are still being denied answers."" A woman known as Andrea from campaign group Police Spies Out of Lives was allegedly duped into a relationship with an undercover officer. She said she was ""dismayed"" at how long it would take, adding: ""We have lost years of our lives due to the harm caused to us by these undercover officers."" She said: ""Our health, relationships and careers have suffered. ""We want to make sure this state-sponsored abuse cannot happen again."" Donal O'Driscoll, who claims he was spied on by undercover officers, said the delay was caused by ""ongoing heel-dragging and obstruction by the police"". The inquiry was set up by the then home secretary Theresa May after allegations about the activities of undercover units. The inquiry is being led by Sir John Mitting These included claims officers from the Metropolitan Police's Special Demonstration Squad had sexual relationships with women andused the names of dead childrento create fake identities. The Met Police hasapologised and paid compensationto seven women tricked into relationships by undercover officers. It will also investigate claims Scotland Yard spied on campaigners fighting for justice for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence and how officers infiltrated unions and other organisations. The inquiry chaired by Sir John Mitting has now set out an ""ambitious timeline"" with the final report expected before the home secretary in 2023. It has tens of thousands of documents to go through and will hear evidence from at least 250 police witnesses. The inquiry will investigate the alleged spying on a campaign fighting for Stephen Lawrence In March, at least 60campaigners and their legal teams walked outafter former undercover officers were granted anonymity. Critics also want to see the inquiry led by a panel rather than a single judge. Writing in the strategic review, inquiry chairman Sir John rejected calls to appoint panel members until after the fact-finding stage in 2021. He said appointing a panel would ""impose a heavy cost in both time and money"". The chairman said: ""Once the facts have been found, it would be both practicable and desirable for a wider panel to be recruited to investigate and consider the state of undercover policing and to make recommendations to the home secretary for the future.""

"Scientist David Goodall, 104, ends his lifeThe ecologist and botanist, who was not terminally ill, went to Switzerland to voluntarily end his life.1han hour agoEurope","This video can not be played ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it"" Scientist David Goodall, 104, has died after choosing to end his life at a clinic in Switzerland, a right-to-die organisation says. The lauded London-born ecologist and botanist, who was not terminally ill, said the decision had been driven by his deteriorating quality of life. Mr Goodall had flown from Australia for his assisted suicide, attracting the attention of people around the world. Shortly before his death, he said he was ""happy to end"" his life. ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it,"" he said, surrounded by several family members. ""All the publicity that this has been receiving can only, I think, help the cause of euthanasia for the elderly, which I want."" The admired scientist who wanted a say in how his life ended The academic died ""peacefully"" at 12:30 (10:30 GMT) at the Life Cycle clinic in Basel, from an infusion of Nembutal, a barbiturate, said Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, the group which helped him take his own life. He was visibly frustrated by the process of formal paperwork, and Mr Nitschke later said: ""In fact his last words were 'This is taking an awfully long time!'"" Mr Goodall's last meal was his favourite - fish and chips and cheesecake - and in his final minutes he was played Ode to Joy from Beethoven's 9th symphony. Mr Goodall had lived on his own in a small flat in Perth, Western Australia, until only a few weeks before his trip to Switzerland. He stepped back from full-time employment in 1979, but remained heavily involved in his field of work. This video can not be played David Goodall, 104, sets out his reasons for travelling to Switzerland to voluntarily end his life Among his achievements in recent years, Mr Goodall edited a 30-volume book series called Ecosystems of the World and was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his scientific work. In 2016, aged 102, he won a battle to keep working on campus at Perth's Edith Cowan University, where he was an unpaid honorary research associate. Mr Goodall said he resented having to leave Australia to end his life. Assisted dying is legal in only one state, but eligibility requires a person to be terminally ill. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is strongly opposed to assisted dying, which it sees as an unethical practice of medicine. Meanwhile, Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Mr Goodall arrived in Basel on Monday after visiting relatives in France, and spent his final full day exploring the Basel University botanic gardens with three of his grandchildren. What different countries say about assisted dying At a press conference on Wednesday, he said he was surprised by the public interest in his case. He added: ""I no longer want to continue life. ""One wants to, at my age, even rather less than my age... to be free to choose death when the death is at an appropriate time."" He wanted no funeral and requested that his body be donated to medicine or his ashes sprinkled locally, Exit International said. Assisted suicide describes any act that intentionally helps another person kill themselves, for example by providing them with the means to do so, most commonly by prescribing a lethal medication. It differs from euthanasia, which is a third-party intervention to end a life to relieve suffering, such as when a doctor administers the lethal dose. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is allowed only if the person assisting acts unselfishly. It is the only country with centres offering assisted suicide to foreign nationals The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg permit euthanasia and assisted suicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is available to minors in specific instances Colombia allows euthanasia The US states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, California, Colorado and Hawaii permit assisted dying for terminally ill patients. The US capital Washington DC implemented a similar law for the city's residents in 2017 Canada followed the province of Quebec in permitting euthanasia and assisted suicide in 2016 Australian scientist, 104, ends life 'happy' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Cancer delays 'leave patients at risk',"The aim is for patients to get all the checks they need under one roof The lives of cancer patients are being put at risk, experts say, as the NHS struggles to see people quickly enough. Patients are meant to start cancer treatment within 62 days of it being suspected, but nowhere in the UK has achieved this for more than two years. It means one in six patients is now waiting longer than they should, the BBC analysis of official figures found. It comes as data in England showed last-minute cancellations of operations have hit an all-time high. There were more than 25,000 late cancelled operations from January to March - the highest since records began in the mid-1990s.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories This came despite NHS bosses ordering the cancellation of many January operations in advance in an attempt to relieve the pressure on A&Es and stop surgery being scrapped at the last minute. Ian Eardley, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said it showed just how difficult winter had been. He said last-minute cancellations, which take place on the day or the day before, were ""very distressing"" for patients. These cancellations cover both cancer patients and those waiting for other operations, such as knee and hip replacements. England last hit its key 62-day target in December 2015, while in Scotland you have to go back to the end of 2012. Wales has been failing since 2008 and Northern Ireland has never met its target since it was set in 2009. The continued struggle to hit the target has meant a growing number of patients are waiting over 62 days. Fran Woodard, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the situation was ""extremely dispiriting"". ""Long waits to start cancer treatment can make an already difficult time even more distressing and unbearable, while also raising the possibility of someone's health deteriorating further,"" she said. The reasons behind the growing pressures on the cancer system are similar to those experienced in A&E and in planned operations. The numbers needing treatment have been rising - there has been a 26% rise in cases since 2012-13. There are also growing shortages of staff, with hospitals reporting problems recruiting cancer doctors and chemotherapy nurses in particular, while bottlenecks in getting diagnostic tests done have been reported. Hospitals have also said they have begun to struggle to free up the intensive care beds needed for patients undergoing surgery, because of the growing numbers of emergency cases coming through the doors of A&E. Ronny Andrews, 64, waited eight months for treatment - four times longer than he should have. Doctors discovered a tumour on his liver in January 2017, but by the time he was offered chemotherapy it was too late. His cancer was terminal. He says he tries not to get angry, but believes he could have had another three or four years if he had got quicker treatment. ""I'm resigned to it now. This is it. I try to smile and get on with it. Death comes to us all."" Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which was in charge of his care, said his cancer had been difficult to diagnose. His initial biopsy was delayed and then when it did take place it had to be repeated. He has only been given a few months to live. The way the target is measured differs in each part of the UK, although all expect patients to be seen in 62 days once there is an urgent suspicion a patient may have cancer. In England, 85% of patients are meant to be seen in that timeframe, whereas it is 95% in the rest of the UK. In Scotland the core target incorporates those referred via screening as well as by GPs, whereas the core target in England only looks at cases raised by GPs. Cancer has been made a priority by ministers in each nation. England is half-way through its five-year cancer strategy, which is seeing a major upgrade in radiotherapy machines, extra staff being recruited and a new four-week target being introduced for diagnostic testing. The most recent month, March, saw the nation record its best performance for two years. A government spokesman said the delays were not acceptable, but added survival rates were improving and other cancer targets were being met. While Wales has failed to hit its target since 2008, it is the only part of the UK that has enjoyed a rise in performance over the past five years. Over the past 12 months, 87.3% of patients were seen in 62 days, up from 85.8% during the same period in 2012-13. A Welsh government spokeswoman said this is happening even though cases continue to rise and treatment is ""increasing in complexity"". A spokesman for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said despite the failure to hit the target, cancer care continues to be one of the ""highest priorities"". However, he acknowledged the performance was ""disappointing"" and said efforts were being made to speed up testing and scans so diagnosis could be made quickly.

Man jailed for killing five-month-old girl,"Gordon McKay arrived at the High Court in Edinburgh for sentencing on Thursday A former soldier who shook his girlfriend's five-month-old daughter to death has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Hayley Davidson died in hospital from a serious brain injury after being found at a house in Buckhaven, Fife, on 14 February 2016. Gordon McKay, 38, had originally been charged with her murder. However, during his trial he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of culpable homicide. What is going wrong in Fife? Sentencing McKay at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Uist told him his victim was an ""innocent, defenceless child"" and that he was guilty of an ""extremely grave crime"". Hayley Davidson died in hospital in February 2016 McKay, who had been looking after the infant, claimed he had found her cold to the touch on a beanbag in his living room. He said he shook her three or four times to try to revive her. Three days after she was found, Hayley died from a head injury in hospital. Hayley's case is one of a string of high profile child deaths in Fife in recent years: Three-year-old Mikaeel Kular's mother Rosdeep Adekoya reported him missing before confessing to killing him and hiding his body in a suitcase in Kirkcaldy in January 2014. Liam Fee was murdered by his mother Rachel Trelfa and her civil partner Nyomi Fee at his home near Glenrothes, Fife, on March 22, 2014. Two-year-old Madison Horn was beaten to death by Kevin Park while he was babysitting her at her home in Kelty in April 2014. Last year, BBC Scotland documentary Fife's Child Killings: The Untold Story investigated why the three children died despite social work involvement and revealed new evidence about the killings. Her mother, Catherine Davidson, lived a few doors away from McKay and formed an ""obsessive"" relationship with him. She left Hayley alone with him so she could get her other two daughters ready for a planned day out. The court heard that Hayley had previously had hospital treatment for a broken arm on New Year's Day 2016 - three months into McKay's relationship with her mother. McKay took responsibility for what he called the accident that caused it, and medics did not view the injury as suspicious. And though social services were notified they did not intervene. Protocol for Fife authorities has been changed as a result of Hayley's case.

"Bank holds rates as UK hits 'soft patch'The Bank of England says the economy is in a ""temporary soft patch"" as it keeps rates on hold.2m3 minutes agoBusinessComments","This video can not be played Mark Carney says the UK economy will pick up The Bank of England said the UK economy has hit a ""temporary soft patch"" as it kept interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The Bank cut its growth forecast for the year to 1.4%, down from the forecast of 1.8% made in February. The Bank says that cut is almost entirely due to the disruption to the economy caused by bad weather in March. However, Bank governor Mark Carney said in an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed that ""it's likely"" rates will rise this year. In a press conference after the rates decision was announced, Mr Carney said the ""underlying pace of growth remains more resilient than the headline data suggests"". As recently as February economists were expecting the Bank to raise interest rates this month. That view changed after figures released last month showed that the economy grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of the year. The slowdown was caused by the Beast from the East - severe weather which shut down construction sites, kept shoppers at home and caused transport chaos. However, the Bank described that as a ""temporary soft patch"" with ""few implications"" for the outlook for the economy. The financial markets are now indicating there will be an interest rate increase towards the end of the year followed by another in 2019, and a further one in 2020. Live reaction to the Bank's decision What would a rate rise mean for me? UK economy in weakest growth since 2012 UK inflation falls to lowest in a year Movements in the Bank's official rates can have big effects on UK households. A rise would mean that about four million households with variable or tracker rate mortgages would see an increase in their monthly payments, while an increase would benefit the nation's 45 million savers. Mr Carney sets interest rates with a team of eight other experts that form the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). At the latest meeting, seven members voted to keep interest rates on hold and two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, voted for an increase. ""It looks like the 2018 rate hike has been delayed not cancelled,"" Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said. However, former MPC member Andrew Sentance said the Bank had ""totally misunderstood"" the economic slowdown. He said persistent low interest rates and uncertainty over their future direction were undermining the pound and hurting consumers by causing inflation. Is Mr Carney revealing once again his ""unreliable boyfriend"" tendencies, promising that interest rate rises are just around the corner, only to pull back? He might suggest that he and the other eight members of the MPC are less the unreliable partners, more the ""sensitive"" listeners. Sensitive to changes in the data which effect a decision based on fine margins and delicate judgements. It was John Maynard Keynes who said that when the facts changed, so, sir, did he. Today the Bank has changed tone. Let's wait and see, it is saying. Let's wait and see how the economy develops until we give any firm guidance on the path of interest rates  beyond the Bank's often used formulation of some limited rises ""over the forecast period"" of the next three years. Yes, they will rise at some point. But the chances of that happening sooner rather than later has receded. Read Kamal's blog in full The minutes from the meeting show the MPC wants to wait and see how the economy performs over the coming months. While they expect it to recover from a weak start to the year, there is a risk that the slowdown could be more persistent. The Office for National Statistics appears to be more pessimistic than the Bank of England. The ONS released data today showing that industrial production expanded just 0.1% in March from February. It said the economy was ""sluggish"" in the first quarter, but said the bad weather had ""little impact overall"", suggesting it thinks the economy has underlying problems. Later on Thursday, in an interview with the BBC's economics editor, Mr Carney said: ""It's likely over the course of the next year rates will go up... that's the most likely thing to happen."" But any rate rises would be at a ""gentle pace"", the governor said. He added that there could be shocks to the UK economy from protectionist trade policies or from Brexit, in which case: ""If the economy slows... then we will adjust policy."" The course of interest rates depends on inflation falling in line with the Bank's expectations. In March, inflation was running at an annual rate of 2.5%, which is above the Bank's target of 2%. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? But in its most recentQuarterly Inflation Report,external, the Bank blames above-target inflation on higher prices of imported goods caused by a weaker pound. The Bank expects that effect to fade over the coming years, bringing inflation back to 2% by early 2021. It also forecast that the unemployment rate would fall further, to 4% by 2020, the Bank's lowest forecast since the financial crisis. Is Carney an unreliable boyfriend - or just sensitive?

Mr Trump said he hoped he could travel to North Korea one day and that he believed Mr Kim wanted to bring his country ""into the real world"". The three men, Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul, were smiling and waving and appeared in good health. In an impromptu chat before the media with Mr Trump, Kim Dong-chul said: ""It's like a dream and we are very, very happy. We were treated in many different ways. For me, I had to do a lot of labour. But when I got sick I was also treated by them."" The three had released an earlier statement saying: ""We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo and the people of the United States for bringing us home. ""We thank God and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return."" The trio had been jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps. It came during a visit to Pyongyang by Mr Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un. Mike Pompeo, the top US diplomat, has met the North Korean leader twice in under six weeks Mr Kim said he had accepted a US proposal to grant the three detainees an amnesty, adding that his meeting with President Trump would be an ""excellent first step"" towards improving the situation on the Korean peninsula, according to the North Korean state news agency KCNA. The convictions of the trio were widely condemned as political and an abuse of human rights. Left to right: Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim Kim Hak-songwas held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" in May 2017.  He had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) Tony Kim,also known as Kim Sang-duk, also worked at PUST. He was detained in April 2017 on espionage charges. According to South Korean media, he had been involved in humanitarian work in the North Kim Dong-chul, a pastor in his early 60s, was detained in 2015 on spying charges, and was then sentenced to 10 years hard labour Who are North Korea's American detainees? Some 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). People can be jailed by the regime for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect from the country. Political prisoners are often sent to separate prisons - usually brutal labour camps, which involve difficult physical work such as mining and logging. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Warmbier died less than a year after his tearful confession in Pyongyang American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced to hard labour, later said he was forced to work on a farm six days a week despite being in poor health. The last American to be freed -Otto Warmbier, who was jailed for stealing a hotel sign - was released last year but was fatally ill, and died shortly after returning home. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, said they were ""happy for the hostages and their families. We miss Otto"". Speaking at Andrews Air Force Base, Mr Trump said he wanted to pay his ""warmest respects"" to the couple. Mr Trump says the time, date and location will be announced ""within three days"". He said the talks would not be held at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea, one of the suggested venues, and Singapore remains the most likely option. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Mr Pompeo said there had been ""good and productive conversations"" with Mr Kim. ""We're planning it will be a single day, but in the event that there is more to discuss, there'll be an opportunity for it to extend into the second day as well,"" Mr Pompeo said. The main issue, of course, will be North Korea's nuclear weapons, which Mr Trump has demanded Pyongyang give up. There has been no word from North Korea on its agenda or what it might offer, although a key issue is certain to be the presence of 30,000 US military personnel in South Korea, along with the removal of sanctions. At a summit in April, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-invowed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, although the means of achieving this were not detailed and previous such pledges have been abandoned.

Fining parents 'has no effect on absence',"This video can not be played Heather Ward: ""I was fined Â£60 for taking my daughter skiing"" Fining parents for taking children out of school in term time in Wales has had no effect on overall absence rates, a review has found. It shows the number of unauthorised family holidays actually increased after fixed penalty notices were introduced in 2013. The review recommends changing the current system. The Welsh Government, which commissioned the report, said it would consider the proposals put forward. Cardiff saw the most fixed penalty notices issued in 2015-16 at 1,531, while Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) had 1,063 issued, 90% of which were fines for term-time holidays. At the other end of the scale, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Carmarthenshire councils issued no notices. Unauthorised holidays at 'record high' Week of school holidays may be moved In Wales ministers have advised head teachers to use discretion to allow parents to take their children out of school for holidays, with fixed penalty notices being issued by councils to those who do so without permission from the school. But there are wide variations in policy of imposing fines in different council areas. Meanwhile in England head teachers can allow term-time breaks in ""exceptional circumstances"" with parents facing the threat of being taken to court if they break the rules. In Scotland fines are not issued but education authorities can issue ""attendance orders"" to make a parent explain a pupil's absence - if no reasonable excuse is given they can be taken to court. In Northern Ireland no fines are issued, with children's attendance being monitored instead. Fines for unauthorised absences in Wales were introduced in 2013 Thereport,external- which surveyed teachers and staff of local authorities and local education consortiums - found the biggest decline in overall absence was in the two years before the Welsh Government brought in the fines. Several respondents said that the level of the fine was too low to encourage behaviour change. They said this was particularly the case for unauthorised absences for holidays in term time because some parents preferred to pay a Â£60 fine compared to the price of going away in the school holidays. One respondent said ""in this deprived area many families cannot afford the costs of a holiday out of term time. If they can, they soak up the cost of the fine as part of the holiday cost (which means the fine has zero effect)"". Interviewees also shared stories of travel agents paying fines as part of a holiday deal or of a social worker paying fines for families that they support to ensure the family's wellbeing is not adversely affected. Some also speculated that parents did not pay fines because they did not believe the local authority would proceed to prosecution. The report notes there are inconsistencies across Wales in when fines are triggered - while 90% of RCT's fixed penalty notices in 2015-16 were issued for holidays, none were given in the Vale of Glamorgan, Caerphilly and Ceredigion for this reason. Heather Ward from Cardiff said she had seen the inconsistencies even within the same local authority area. ""I took my daughter skiing for five days out of school and I was fined Â£60 for taking her out,"" she said. ""We went with a group of 11 people. Two other children, same age different school a mile down the road, they weren't fined and we were. So it's not consistent."" The report suggests strengthening the guidance or establishing a single national policy for Wales - where all local authorities would be told to have the same rules about when a fine should be given, rather than abolishing them. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will consider the proposals in the report alongside other evidence gathered as part of our broader review of attendance policy in Wales.""

House '30in too tall' risks demolition,"Asif Naseem moved his wife and five children into the house two months ago A family has been told to tear down their new home or spend Â£200,000 on a new roof after it was found to be 30 inches (76cm) too tall. Asif Naseem moved into the property in Lightwood, Staffordshire, two months ago with his wife and five children. Stoke-on-Trent council turned down two retrospective planning applications for the Â£500,000 house due to complaints over the height and dormer windows. The family said they had nowhere else to go, and no funds for a new roof. Midlands Live: Pupils injured as primary school ceiling collapses;  M5 roadworks 'three months behind schedule' The family was told the roof ridge was too high and there were complaints about the dormer windows Thirty one objections to the family's retrospective planning application were sent to the council, along with seven letters of support, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Council planners recommended enforcement action being taken, which would mean demolishing the house. At a planning meeting on Wednesday, Shazad Hussein, Mr Naseem's brother, said reducing the house's height ""isn't going to make any visual difference"". ""We have spent all the money on the house,"" he said. ""There are seven people who have nowhere else to go. They sold their other house to fund the new one."" Local reaction to the ""enormous"" house has been ""mixed"", a neighbour said The family's representative said demolition would be ""excessive"" and ""draconian"", leaving the planning committee divided. Vice-chairman Andy Platt said it was ""wrong"" that the house had been built too tall, but to knock it down would be ""a little over the top"". However councillor Janine Bridges said it would ""set a precedent"" for developers to ""build what they like"" and ask permission later.

Secret documents that led to UK apology,"Abdul Hakim Belhaj spent six years in jail in Libya where, he says, he was tortured The British government has made an unprecedented apology to a former Libyan dissident and his wife who were abducted with crucial assistance from MI6. Abdul Hakim Belhaj said MI6 helped the US seize him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his Moroccan wife, Fatima Boudchar, to Libya, where he says he was tortured. The government has accepted the couple's account of what happened - and the settlement is the first time ministers have apologised for a specific act involving British security agencies. The legal battle came about because documents discovered in Tripoli, Libya - during the fall of the dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 - revealed how MI6 became involved in the couple's rendition. While the government's apology maintains a denial of legal liability, the settlement leaves questions unanswered about how much others in government were involved in what happened. This is how the affair developed. In the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the US and its allies were in a race to understand jihadist groups they had previously not done enough to track. British intelligence agencies wanted to know more about Libyan dissidents who had been living under UK protection - mostly families linked to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). Fatima Boudchar, wife of Abdul Hakim Belhadj, and their son, Abderrahim The group had attempted armed overthrows of Gaddafi's regime in the 1990s and its defeated leaders had scattered around the world. The UK's plan was to convince Colonel Gaddafi to not only stop threatening the West, but to also provide intelligence on these LIFG members and their potential links to al-Qaeda. In September 2011, a team from Human Rights Watch raided the abandoned headquarters of Libyan's External Security Organisation (ESO) after the dictator's eventual downfall - and the documents they found made jaws drop. Sir Mark Allen, whose communications reveal the UK's role in handling Mr Belhaj The papers included evidence of how MI6 and the CIA had groomed Gaddafi and his henchmen to come in from the cold - and one senior MI6 officer, Sir Mark Allen, was at the centre of the operation. From 2001 he sought to convince Moussa Koussa - his Libyan counterpart and a man who had been widely accused of torture and other human rights abuses - to work with the West. Mr Koussa wanted two things: international recognition for Libya and respect for Gaddafi - and intelligence leading to the capture of LIFG leaders on the run. The Tripoli documents show the pair met on 20 September 2001 and agreed that each country's counter-terrorism teams should work together against common enemies. MI6 asked if the Libyans would help operations to penetrate jihadist groups. The next document - from the British side - is the first that referred to Mr Belhaj, albeit through one of his aliases and, confusingly, apparently mixing up some of his details with another dissident who was also later abducted. A later secret conference, also including the German and Austrian intelligence services, was detailed in a memo circulated among ESO chiefs. It said that the British and others were ""willing to co-operate"" - but the UK had stressed that any co-operation on tracking down what the Libyans called ""heretics"" would need to be lawful. The MI6 team promised to help the Libyans and began suggesting they had information that could be useful. The breakthrough in relations appears to have come in 2002 when Sir Mark finally convinced Libya to work properly with the UK - leading to the then Foreign Office minister Mike O'Brien visiting the country in August. Later that year, the Libyans came to London and, according to their records, attended a ""banquet dinner"" hosted by MI6 at the Â£500-a-night Goring Hotel. The agency was pressing for more - telling the Libyans they had to move faster and further in co-operating with the West if they were going to get the recognition they sought. All of this diplomacy ultimately led to what became known as the 2004 ""deal in the desert"" - in which Prime Minister Tony Blair sealed what looked like a remarkable turnaround in Colonel Gaddafi's attitude. But it came at a price. And that price was, according to the documents at least, the UK's willingness to provide information on the whereabouts of the regime's enemies. In June 2003, the ESO received a memo from the British setting out the extent of operations to date. Another document contained the first proof that the UK was apparently willing to provide information on what it knew about Mr Belhaj. The British agencies thought he was in China - and initially MI6 didn't confirm that to the Libyans. But in November, a new communication to Tripoli confirmed the British had ""embarked on a project"" relating to the dissident: By the end of 2003, the UK was pretty confident the Libyan's were co-operating and on the road to a comprehensive deal for Libya to give up its chemical weapons. On Christmas Eve of that year, Sir Mark sent a memo to Mr Koussa, thanking him for his efforts: The UK and US were confident they were getting a deal - and it was now time for the UK to settle the intelligence bill. On 1 March, London told Tripoli that Mr Belhaj, travelling under a pseudonym, had been apprehended by the Chinese authorities as he tried to board a flight to London with his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who was four months pregnant. The couple were deported to Malaysia and were being held in detention.  An MI6 cable listed all the false names Mr Belhaj was thought to be using, such as Abdullah Sadeq, to evade capture. Libya fired off a series of urgent requests to Malaysia's government, requesting that it hand over the ""dangerous"" dissident who it considered ""the prince of the LIFG"". The US intervened and told Tripoli it was going to help secure Mr Belhaj and bring him to Libya - providing that it would get a chance to interrogate him once he was behind bars. On 6 March, the plan was in place. Malaysian authorities put Mr Belhaj and Mrs Boudchar on a flight to Bangkok where, instead of being transferred on to a connection for London, the Thai authorities detained them and, according to their lawyers, they were tortured. The following day, a US rendition flight team picked up the pair and flew them to Tripoli. On 18 March, Sir Mark sent this congratulatory message to Mr Koussa - making clear that he believed the capture of Mr Belhaj, referred to here by his nom de guerre Abu 'Abd Allsh, was down to the British alone: Mr Belhaj, one of Gaddafi's greatest enemies, was tortured over six years and given a death sentence, which was never carried out. His wife was released before she gave birth - and the son she was carrying at the time was in the House of Commons to hear the historic apology from the UK. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the settlement with the couple included a Â£500,000 payment to Ms Boudchar. ""It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly,"" Theresa May said in a letter to the pair. ""We should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated,"" she added. ""We accept this was a failing on our part."" Sir Mark Allen has never spoken publicly about the affair. He, along with former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and all the agencies involved, denied individual wrongdoing.

"BT cuts 13,000 jobs to slash costs","BT is to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, about 12% of its workforce, as it seeks to slim down its management and back-office roles. The telecoms giant said,externalthat the job cuts and other measures would help it to reduce costs by Â£1.5bn. It added that it would be hiring about 6,000 employees to ""support network deployment and customer service"". A third of the job reductions will come from outside the UK in its Global Services division. Last year, BT was forced to write down the value of the Italian part of Global Services afteran accounting scandal that cost the firm more than Â£500m. The company also said it intended to move out of its existing central London headquarters and into smaller premises. BT forecast a fall in revenue of about 2% for the 2018-19 financial year. It also said it was keeping its full-year dividend unchanged from last year at 15.4p a share and would freeze it for the next two years. Shares in BT fell nearly 8% in early trading. Philippa Childs, national secretary of the Prospect union, said the announcement was ""a devastating blow to managers and professionals represented by Prospect"". She said Prospect had been working closely with BT on looking at the impact of organisational changes, but the number of job cuts sounded ""unrealistic"". BT said it was responding to changes in the telecoms market, including ""increasing competitive intensity from established companies and new entrants"". ""It is critical that BT transforms its operating model to build a lean and agile organisation that delivers sustained improvement in customer experience and productivity,"" it said. The announcements came as BT disclosed that its annual pre-tax profits rose 11% to Â£2.6bn in the year to March. The firm also announced a 13-year plan to plug its Â£11.3bn pension fund deficit, including regular payments into the scheme and a bond issue. Chief executive Gavin Patterson said BT was in a unique position: ""We have the UK's leading fixed and mobile access networks, a portfolio of strong and well segmented brands, and close strategic partnerships. ""This position of strength will enable us to build on the disciplined delivery and risk reduction of the last financial year, a period in which we delivered overall in line with our financial and operational commitments whilst addressing many uncertainties."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the job cuts and HQ move were ""drastic actions"", but added that they ""still aren't going to be enough to dig BT out the hole it's in"". ""The dividend, which was rising 10% a year not so long ago, is set to freeze for the foreseeable future, and next year's profits look likely to fall again,"" he added. ""There are silver linings here and there. For example, EE and the consumer businesses continue to grow. However, these improvements are being more than offset by challenging conditions elsewhere. ""Openreach terms are getting tougher, and the business-to-business and global divisions are having a torrid time. Gavin Patterson will have his work cut out if he's to steady the ship."" BT's share price has halved over the past two years. Investors have become less convinced about the company's ability to make them money, after an accounting scandal, a profits warning and a regulatory fine. BT clearly thinks it has too many staff doing jobs not needed in the digital world. Its wide-ranging corporate shake-up is an attempt to simplify the business, to squeeze more profit out of each pound it spends. It's under pressure to pump more money into fibre optic and super-fast mobile networks and to fill the black hole in its pension scheme. It has made more efforts on those fronts today. Thousands of new hires will be engineers and cyber-experts, focusing not on copper cables, but on building the physical and mobile networks of the future. It's also trying to improve its customer service and mend relations with the regulator. It's a big job, turning a former monopoly into a consumer-focused TV and phone company. Shares are down sharply, suggesting investors are yet to be convinced by BT's plan.

Severn Trent boss is businesswoman of the yearSevern Trent boss Liv Garfield is among those honoured at the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Awards.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Chief executive of Severn Trent, Liv Garfield, was praised for her strong focus on customers The boss of a water company and the founder of a luxury sex toy company have won top awards for businesswomen. Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent, was crowned Business Woman of the Year at the Veuve Clicquot awards ceremony. Her company's share price has risen 15% since Ms Garfield took the helm in 2014 and judges hailed her business acumen. Stephanie Alys, the creator of MysteryVibe, won the New Generation award for ""breaking down barriers"". The Veuve Clicquot Business Woman awards were created in 1972 as a tribute to Madame Clicquot, who single-handedly took over her husband's champagne business after he died. Previous winners of the UK ceremony include Anya Hindmarch and Alison Brittain, chief executive of Whitbread. Ms Garfield, 42, who is a working mother with two young sons, worked at BT and Accenture before joining Severn Trent. Stephanie Alys (L) won the New Generation award while Amanda Nevill (R) received the Social Purpose Award She said: ""My ideal is to see the boys in the morning before I go to work, or in the evening, but either way we share lots of video messages during the day."" She added that she tried to create ""an awesome place to work"" so others enjoyed their jobs, adding: ""You have to love your job to get on with it."" Judges praised Ms Garfield's decision to introduce menopause awareness training at Severn Trent. She told the BBC's Today programme: ""The menopause is a hugely important topic if we're going to have more women in the workplace. It's something that 97% of women will go through and yet it's a taboo subject. ""We believe at Severn Trent that great companies are based on the right culture, and that means topics like menopause being discussed and making sure that you train your whole workforce in all that will mean for women in the workplace."" Ms Alys, 28, whose company, MysteryVibe, sells its vibrator, called Crescendo, in 58 countries, was praised by the judges for her aim ""to close the pleasure gap by bringing equality to sex"". ""She is leading the revolution in sex-tech,"" the judges said. ""Demonstrating the same characteristics of Madame Clicquot over 200 years ago, Stephanie is breaking down barriers and social taboos."" Allow Twitter content?

""Creating any business is really hard but creating one in this industry is even harder."" Also receiving a gong at the awards ceremony was Amanda Nevill, the chief executive of the British Film Institute, who received the Social Purpose Award. Judges chose Ms Nevill, 61, because of her focus on future talent and action to tackle harassment and bullying in the film industry.

"Homes swept away in deadly Kenya dam burstAt least 32 people die after a dam bursts in Kenya, sending floodwater through hundreds of homes.","This video can not be played The search-and-rescue effort is under way in Kenya At least 41 people have died after heavy rains caused a dam to burst in Kenya, sweeping away homes across a vast area of farmland. The breach happened on Wednesday near the town of Solai, 190km (120 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi. The dead are thought to include children and women trapped in mud. The Kenyan Red Cross says it has rescued about 40 people so far. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless. Local officials say the full extent of the damage is not yet clear. There are fears the death toll could rise as the search-and-rescue operation continues. Latest updates on the dam burst The heavy rains in Kenya and other regional states come after a severe drought which left millions of people in need of food aid. The dead included children and women trapped in the mud Eleven bodies, mostly of women and children, were recovered at a coffee plantation, an unnamed police officer told AFP news agency. It seemed that they had been fleeing but ""could not make it due to the force and speed of the water from the flooded dam"", the officer added. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless The Patel dam, located on private farmland, and reportedly used for irrigation and fish farming, broke its walls and swept away hundreds of homes downstream. Much of the area was completely devastated as power lines, homes and buildings were carried away by the fast-running water. A secondary school was also flooded, while a primary school was swept away. By Anne Soy, BBC News, Solai Torrential rains are continuing to fall, hampering rescue efforts. Shocked and grieving survivors are sheltering under the canopies of remaining buildings. Foundation slabs of the swept away buildings are lying exposed along a wide path, created by the raging water. There is a deep gully running down the hill from where Patel dam burst. Household items, boulders and mangled iron sheets are strewn across the flood path. Kenya Red Cross volunteers, the police, and military officers are at the scene. It is being described as the biggest tragedy in Kenya since heavy rain started nearly two months ago. The bodies of two women were discovered several miles away from the area affected by the bursting of the dam, the Reuters news agency reported. Witnesses said they heard a loud bang before the waves swept through nearly 2km (1.2 miles) of farmland where many people live and work. On Thursday, rescue workers brandishing shovels scoured through the rubble and mud, searching for survivors and victims ""The water has caused huge destruction of both life and property. The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained,"" said Lee Kinyajui, governor of Nakuru County. Miriam Karimi told AFP she had not been able to find her three children in the aftermath, including her four-year-old son. ""I'm so confused. I hope they are alive,"" she said. Survivor Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, told Reuters that she was at home brewing tea when her son's wife rushed in to say they needed to get to higher ground as the dam had burst. ""It was a sea of water. My neighbour was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,"" she was quoted as saying. ""My other neighbours also died. All our houses have been ruined,"" Ms Ngigi added. The Patel dam is one of three reservoirs owned by a large-scale farmer in the area. Its walls are said to have caved in due to the high volumes of water following heavy rains that have been pounding the country. The flood swept through farmland, wrecking homes in its wake The burst dam was ""a sea of water,"" one survivor said And it is still raining Local leaders are now seeking to find out whether the farmer was licensed to erect those dams, amid concerns about the condition of the remaining two which are also said to be full, reports the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi. He has not yet commented. Before Wednesday's disaster, 132 people have died countrywide as a result of heavy rains since March, according to official statistics. More than 220,000 people have also had their homes destroyed.

Trump greets trio freed by North Korea,"This video can not be played President Trump speaks to reporters as he welcomes the detainees US President Donald Trump has welcomed home three American detainees released by North Korea. Mr Trump said it was a ""special night for these really great people"" as they arrived at the Andrews Air Force Base near Washington. The White House said the trio had been freed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the planned meeting between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump said he thought the summit would be ""a big success"". North Korea crisis in 300 words The tricky task of preparing for the summit The date and location have been decided but not yet announced. Mr Trump and his wife Melania entered the plane after it landed at about 02:45 local time (06:45 GMT) and a few minutes later emerged with the three men to wave to the media. The president said he appreciated that Mr Kim had allowed the men to leave as ""frankly we didn't think that was going to happen before the meeting"". Allow Twitter content?

Asked if this was his proudest achievement, he said that would be ""when we denuclearise that entire peninsula"". ""It's a great honour. But the true honour is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons."" Of the upcoming summit, he said: ""I think that we're going to have... a very big success... I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful."" Mr Trump said he hoped he could travel to North Korea one day and that he believed Mr Kim wanted to bring his country ""into the real world"". The three men, Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul, were smiling and waving and appeared in good health. In an impromptu chat before the media with Mr Trump, Kim Dong-chul said: ""It's like a dream and we are very, very happy. We were treated in many different ways. For me, I had to do a lot of labour. But when I got sick I was also treated by them."" The three had released an earlier statement saying: ""We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo and the people of the United States for bringing us home. ""We thank God and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return."" The trio had been jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps. It came during a visit to Pyongyang by Mr Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un. Mike Pompeo, the top US diplomat, has met the North Korean leader twice in under six weeks Mr Kim said he had accepted a US proposal to grant the three detainees an amnesty, adding that his meeting with President Trump would be an ""excellent first step"" towards improving the situation on the Korean peninsula, according to the North Korean state news agency KCNA. The convictions of the trio were widely condemned as political and an abuse of human rights. Left to right: Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim Kim Hak-songwas held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" in May 2017.  He had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) Tony Kim,also known as Kim Sang-duk, also worked at PUST. He was detained in April 2017 on espionage charges. According to South Korean media, he had been involved in humanitarian work in the North Kim Dong-chul, a pastor in his early 60s, was detained in 2015 on spying charges, and was then sentenced to 10 years hard labour Who are North Korea's American detainees? Some 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). People can be jailed by the regime for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect from the country. Political prisoners are often sent to separate prisons - usually brutal labour camps, which involve difficult physical work such as mining and logging. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Warmbier died less than a year after his tearful confession in Pyongyang American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced to hard labour, later said he was forced to work on a farm six days a week despite being in poor health. The last American to be freed -Otto Warmbier, who was jailed for stealing a hotel sign - was released last year but was fatally ill, and died shortly after returning home. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, said they were ""happy for the hostages and their families. We miss Otto"". Speaking at Andrews Air Force Base, Mr Trump said he wanted to pay his ""warmest respects"" to the couple. Mr Trump says the time, date and location will be announced ""within three days"". He said the talks would not be held at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea, one of the suggested venues, and Singapore remains the most likely option. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Mr Pompeo said there had been ""good and productive conversations"" with Mr Kim. ""We're planning it will be a single day, but in the event that there is more to discuss, there'll be an opportunity for it to extend into the second day as well,"" Mr Pompeo said. The main issue, of course, will be North Korea's nuclear weapons, which Mr Trump has demanded Pyongyang give up. There has been no word from North Korea on its agenda or what it might offer, although a key issue is certain to be the presence of 30,000 US military personnel in South Korea, along with the removal of sanctions. At a summit in April, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-invowed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, although the means of achieving this were not detailed and previous such pledges have been abandoned.

Homes swept away in deadly Kenya dam burst,"This video can not be played The search-and-rescue effort is under way in Kenya At least 41 people have died after heavy rains caused a dam to burst in Kenya, sweeping away homes across a vast area of farmland. The breach happened on Wednesday near the town of Solai, 190km (120 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi. The dead are thought to include children and women trapped in mud. The Kenyan Red Cross says it has rescued about 40 people so far. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless. Local officials say the full extent of the damage is not yet clear. There are fears the death toll could rise as the search-and-rescue operation continues. Latest updates on the dam burst The heavy rains in Kenya and other regional states come after a severe drought which left millions of people in need of food aid. The dead included children and women trapped in the mud Eleven bodies, mostly of women and children, were recovered at a coffee plantation, an unnamed police officer told AFP news agency. It seemed that they had been fleeing but ""could not make it due to the force and speed of the water from the flooded dam"", the officer added. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless The Patel dam, located on private farmland, and reportedly used for irrigation and fish farming, broke its walls and swept away hundreds of homes downstream. Much of the area was completely devastated as power lines, homes and buildings were carried away by the fast-running water. A secondary school was also flooded, while a primary school was swept away. By Anne Soy, BBC News, Solai Torrential rains are continuing to fall, hampering rescue efforts. Shocked and grieving survivors are sheltering under the canopies of remaining buildings. Foundation slabs of the swept away buildings are lying exposed along a wide path, created by the raging water. There is a deep gully running down the hill from where Patel dam burst. Household items, boulders and mangled iron sheets are strewn across the flood path. Kenya Red Cross volunteers, the police, and military officers are at the scene. It is being described as the biggest tragedy in Kenya since heavy rain started nearly two months ago. The bodies of two women were discovered several miles away from the area affected by the bursting of the dam, the Reuters news agency reported. Witnesses said they heard a loud bang before the waves swept through nearly 2km (1.2 miles) of farmland where many people live and work. On Thursday, rescue workers brandishing shovels scoured through the rubble and mud, searching for survivors and victims ""The water has caused huge destruction of both life and property. The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained,"" said Lee Kinyajui, governor of Nakuru County. Miriam Karimi told AFP she had not been able to find her three children in the aftermath, including her four-year-old son. ""I'm so confused. I hope they are alive,"" she said. Survivor Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, told Reuters that she was at home brewing tea when her son's wife rushed in to say they needed to get to higher ground as the dam had burst. ""It was a sea of water. My neighbour was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,"" she was quoted as saying. ""My other neighbours also died. All our houses have been ruined,"" Ms Ngigi added. The Patel dam is one of three reservoirs owned by a large-scale farmer in the area. Its walls are said to have caved in due to the high volumes of water following heavy rains that have been pounding the country. The flood swept through farmland, wrecking homes in its wake The burst dam was ""a sea of water,"" one survivor said And it is still raining Local leaders are now seeking to find out whether the farmer was licensed to erect those dams, amid concerns about the condition of the remaining two which are also said to be full, reports the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi. He has not yet commented. Before Wednesday's disaster, 132 people have died countrywide as a result of heavy rains since March, according to official statistics. More than 220,000 people have also had their homes destroyed.

Severn Trent boss is businesswoman of the year,"Chief executive of Severn Trent, Liv Garfield, was praised for her strong focus on customers The boss of a water company and the founder of a luxury sex toy company have won top awards for businesswomen. Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent, was crowned Business Woman of the Year at the Veuve Clicquot awards ceremony. Her company's share price has risen 15% since Ms Garfield took the helm in 2014 and judges hailed her business acumen. Stephanie Alys, the creator of MysteryVibe, won the New Generation award for ""breaking down barriers"". The Veuve Clicquot Business Woman awards were created in 1972 as a tribute to Madame Clicquot, who single-handedly took over her husband's champagne business after he died. Previous winners of the UK ceremony include Anya Hindmarch and Alison Brittain, chief executive of Whitbread. Ms Garfield, 42, who is a working mother with two young sons, worked at BT and Accenture before joining Severn Trent. Stephanie Alys (L) won the New Generation award while Amanda Nevill (R) received the Social Purpose Award She said: ""My ideal is to see the boys in the morning before I go to work, or in the evening, but either way we share lots of video messages during the day."" She added that she tried to create ""an awesome place to work"" so others enjoyed their jobs, adding: ""You have to love your job to get on with it."" Judges praised Ms Garfield's decision to introduce menopause awareness training at Severn Trent. She told the BBC's Today programme: ""The menopause is a hugely important topic if we're going to have more women in the workplace. It's something that 97% of women will go through and yet it's a taboo subject. ""We believe at Severn Trent that great companies are based on the right culture, and that means topics like menopause being discussed and making sure that you train your whole workforce in all that will mean for women in the workplace."" Ms Alys, 28, whose company, MysteryVibe, sells its vibrator, called Crescendo, in 58 countries, was praised by the judges for her aim ""to close the pleasure gap by bringing equality to sex"". ""She is leading the revolution in sex-tech,"" the judges said. ""Demonstrating the same characteristics of Madame Clicquot over 200 years ago, Stephanie is breaking down barriers and social taboos."" Allow Twitter content?

""Creating any business is really hard but creating one in this industry is even harder."" Also receiving a gong at the awards ceremony was Amanda Nevill, the chief executive of the British Film Institute, who received the Social Purpose Award. Judges chose Ms Nevill, 61, because of her focus on future talent and action to tackle harassment and bullying in the film industry. She said: ""When I started out in the 1980s we thought we had cracked this, but we so haven't. There a whole new momentum now so the situation is very different.""

Cancer delays 'leave patients at risk'UK struggling to hit cancer targets as number of cancelled operations hit record high in England.6m7 minutes agoHealth,"The aim is for patients to get all the checks they need under one roof The lives of cancer patients are being put at risk, experts say, as the NHS struggles to see people quickly enough. Patients are meant to start cancer treatment within 62 days of it being suspected, but nowhere in the UK has achieved this for more than two years. It means one in six patients is now waiting longer than they should, the BBC analysis of official figures found. It comes as data in England showed last-minute cancellations of operations have hit an all-time high. There were more than 25,000 late cancelled operations from January to March - the highest since records began in the mid-1990s.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories This came despite NHS bosses ordering the cancellation of many January operations in advance in an attempt to relieve the pressure on A&Es and stop surgery being scrapped at the last minute. Ian Eardley, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said it showed just how difficult winter had been. He said last-minute cancellations, which take place on the day or the day before, were ""very distressing"" for patients. These cancellations cover both cancer patients and those waiting for other operations, such as knee and hip replacements. England last hit its key 62-day target in December 2015, while in Scotland you have to go back to the end of 2012. Wales has been failing since 2008 and Northern Ireland has never met its target since it was set in 2009. The continued struggle to hit the target has meant a growing number of patients are waiting over 62 days. Fran Woodard, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the situation was ""extremely dispiriting"". ""Long waits to start cancer treatment can make an already difficult time even more distressing and unbearable, while also raising the possibility of someone's health deteriorating further,"" she said. The reasons behind the growing pressures on the cancer system are similar to those experienced in A&E and in planned operations. The numbers needing treatment have been rising - there has been a 26% rise in cases since 2012-13. There are also growing shortages of staff, with hospitals reporting problems recruiting cancer doctors and chemotherapy nurses in particular, while bottlenecks in getting diagnostic tests done have been reported. Hospitals have also said they have begun to struggle to free up the intensive care beds needed for patients undergoing surgery, because of the growing numbers of emergency cases coming through the doors of A&E. Ronny Andrews, 64, waited eight months for treatment - four times longer than he should have. Doctors discovered a tumour on his liver in January 2017, but by the time he was offered chemotherapy it was too late. His cancer was terminal. He says he tries not to get angry, but believes he could have had another three or four years if he had got quicker treatment. ""I'm resigned to it now. This is it. I try to smile and get on with it. Death comes to us all."" Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which was in charge of his care, said his cancer had been difficult to diagnose. His initial biopsy was delayed and then when it did take place it had to be repeated. He has only been given a few months to live. The way the target is measured differs in each part of the UK, although all expect patients to be seen in 62 days once there is an urgent suspicion a patient may have cancer. In England, 85% of patients are meant to be seen in that timeframe, whereas it is 95% in the rest of the UK. In Scotland the core target incorporates those referred via screening as well as by GPs, whereas the core target in England only looks at cases raised by GPs. Cancer has been made a priority by ministers in each nation. England is half-way through its five-year cancer strategy, which is seeing a major upgrade in radiotherapy machines, extra staff being recruited and a new four-week target being introduced for diagnostic testing. The most recent month, March, saw the nation record its best performance for two years. A government spokesman said the delays were not acceptable, but added survival rates were improving and other cancer targets were being met. While Wales has failed to hit its target since 2008, it is the only part of the UK that has enjoyed a rise in performance over the past five years. Over the past 12 months, 87.3% of patients were seen in 62 days, up from 85.8% during the same period in 2012-13. A Welsh government spokeswoman said this is happening even though cases continue to rise and treatment is ""increasing in complexity"". A spokesman for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said despite the failure to hit the target, cancer care continues to be one of the ""highest priorities"". However, he acknowledged the performance was ""disappointing"" and said efforts were being made to speed up testing and scans so diagnosis could be made quickly.

App allows medics to view 999 patientsThe emergency services can assess how seriously ill a person is before setting off to the scene.,"A doctor viewing a 999 caller A new app which allows air ambulance services to view patients before they arrive to treat them is being trialled in two areas of England. The GoodSam app sends a link to the 999 caller's mobile phone, which opens live streaming. Medics can then assess how seriously ill a patient is before setting off. Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance and Great North Air Ambulance Service are currently testing the system, and results so far have been promising. Prof Richard Lyon, associate medical director of Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance, said: ""It's game-changing."" He added: ""Time is critical in saving a person's life or reducing long-term disability, and often we have limited information from bystanders about a patient's or multiple patients' injuries to make decisions. ""Being able to see the scene of the incident, not only the patients, but how many cars are involved for example, can help us decide what additional resources we might need to send, assess who we might need to treat first or what medication we might need to give,"" he said. Watch an earlier version of the app in action The trial of the app has been running for two months. Prof Mark Wilson, medical director of the company which made the app, said they did not yet have hard data on results. However, he said giving doctors the opportunity to see someone's burn, for example, would allow them to make an early assessment. He added: ""The data doesn't remain on the patients' mobile phone. It only streams when they give permission and then once streamed it has gone."" Currently there are no plans to expand the service in the UK, but discussions are under way to trial the technology in remote locations in Africa, where emergency services can be hours away. 999 crews 'should share control rooms' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Rates on hold as Bank cuts growth outlook,"This video can not be played Mark Carney says the UK economy will pick up The Bank of England said the UK economy has hit a ""temporary soft patch"" as it kept interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The Bank cut its growth forecast for the year to 1.4%, down from the forecast of 1.8% made in February. The Bank says that cut is almost entirely due to the disruption to the economy caused by bad weather in March. However, Bank governor Mark Carney said in an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed that ""it's likely"" rates will rise this year. In a press conference after the rates decision was announced, Mr Carney said the ""underlying pace of growth remains more resilient than the headline data suggests"". As recently as February economists were expecting the Bank to raise interest rates this month. That view changed after figures released last month showed that the economy grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of the year. The slowdown was caused by the Beast from the East - severe weather which shut down construction sites, kept shoppers at home and caused transport chaos. However, the Bank described that as a ""temporary soft patch"" with ""few implications"" for the outlook for the economy. The financial markets are now indicating there will be an interest rate increase towards the end of the year followed by another in 2019, and a further one in 2020. Live reaction to the Bank's decision What would a rate rise mean for me? UK economy in weakest growth since 2012 UK inflation falls to lowest in a year Movements in the Bank's official rates can have big effects on UK households. A rise would mean that about four million households with variable or tracker rate mortgages would see an increase in their monthly payments, while an increase would benefit the nation's 45 million savers. Mr Carney sets interest rates with a team of eight other experts that form the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). At the latest meeting, seven members voted to keep interest rates on hold and two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, voted for an increase. ""It looks like the 2018 rate hike has been delayed not cancelled,"" Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said. However, former MPC member Andrew Sentance said the Bank had ""totally misunderstood"" the economic slowdown. He said persistent low interest rates and uncertainty over their future direction were undermining the pound and hurting consumers by causing inflation. Is Mr Carney revealing once again his ""unreliable boyfriend"" tendencies, promising that interest rate rises are just around the corner, only to pull back? He might suggest that he and the other eight members of the MPC are less the unreliable partners, more the ""sensitive"" listeners. Sensitive to changes in the data which effect a decision based on fine margins and delicate judgements. It was John Maynard Keynes who said that when the facts changed, so, sir, did he. Today the Bank has changed tone. Let's wait and see, it is saying. Let's wait and see how the economy develops until we give any firm guidance on the path of interest rates  beyond the Bank's often used formulation of some limited rises ""over the forecast period"" of the next three years. Yes, they will rise at some point. But the chances of that happening sooner rather than later has receded. Read Kamal's blog in full The minutes from the meeting show the MPC wants to wait and see how the economy performs over the coming months. While they expect it to recover from a weak start to the year, there is a risk that the slowdown could be more persistent. The Office for National Statistics appears to be more pessimistic than the Bank of England. The ONS released data today showing that industrial production expanded just 0.1% in March from February. It said the economy was ""sluggish"" in the first quarter, but said the bad weather had ""little impact overall"", suggesting it thinks the economy has underlying problems. Later on Thursday, in an interview with the BBC's economics editor, Mr Carney said: ""It's likely over the course of the next year rates will go up... that's the most likely thing to happen."" But any rate rises would be at a ""gentle pace"", the governor said. He added that there could be shocks to the UK economy from protectionist trade policies or from Brexit, in which case: ""If the economy slows... then we will adjust policy."" The course of interest rates depends on inflation falling in line with the Bank's expectations. In March, inflation was running at an annual rate of 2.5%, which is above the Bank's target of 2%. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? But in its most recentQuarterly Inflation Report,external, the Bank blames above-target inflation on higher prices of imported goods caused by a weaker pound. The Bank expects that effect to fade over the coming years, bringing inflation back to 2% by early 2021. It also forecast that the unemployment rate would fall further, to 4% by 2020, the Bank's lowest forecast since the financial crisis. Is Carney an unreliable boyfriend - or just sensitive?

"Scientist David Goodall, 104, ends his lifeThe ecologist and botanist had travelled from Australia to Switzerland to voluntarily end his life.24m24 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it"" Scientist David Goodall, 104, has died after choosing to end his life at a clinic in Switzerland, a right-to-die organisation says. The lauded London-born ecologist and botanist, who was not terminally ill, said the decision had been driven by his deteriorating quality of life. Mr Goodall had flown from Australia for his assisted suicide, attracting the attention of people around the world. Shortly before his death, he said he was ""happy to end"" his life. ""My life has been rather poor for the past year or so and I'm very happy to end it,"" he said, surrounded by several family members. ""All the publicity that this has been receiving can only, I think, help the cause of euthanasia for the elderly, which I want."" The admired scientist who wanted a say in how his life ended The academic died ""peacefully"" at 12:30 (10:30 GMT) at the Life Cycle clinic in Basel, from an infusion of Nembutal, a barbiturate, said Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, the group which helped him take his own life. He was visibly frustrated by the process of formal paperwork, and Mr Nitschke later said: ""In fact his last words were 'This is taking an awfully long time!'"" Mr Goodall's last meal was his favourite - fish and chips and cheesecake - and in his final minutes he was played Ode to Joy from Beethoven's 9th symphony. Mr Goodall had lived on his own in a small flat in Perth, Western Australia, until only a few weeks before his trip to Switzerland. He stepped back from full-time employment in 1979, but remained heavily involved in his field of work. This video can not be played David Goodall, 104, sets out his reasons for travelling to Switzerland to voluntarily end his life Among his achievements in recent years, Mr Goodall edited a 30-volume book series called Ecosystems of the World and was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his scientific work. In 2016, aged 102, he won a battle to keep working on campus at Perth's Edith Cowan University, where he was an unpaid honorary research associate. Mr Goodall said he resented having to leave Australia to end his life. Assisted dying is legal in only one state, but eligibility requires a person to be terminally ill. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is strongly opposed to assisted dying, which it sees as an unethical practice of medicine. Meanwhile, Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Mr Goodall arrived in Basel on Monday after visiting relatives in France, and spent his final full day exploring the Basel University botanic gardens with three of his grandchildren. What different countries say about assisted dying At a press conference on Wednesday, he said he was surprised by the public interest in his case. He added: ""I no longer want to continue life. ""One wants to, at my age, even rather less than my age... to be free to choose death when the death is at an appropriate time."" He wanted no funeral and requested that his body be donated to medicine or his ashes sprinkled locally, Exit International said. Assisted suicide describes any act that intentionally helps another person kill themselves, for example by providing them with the means to do so, most commonly by prescribing a lethal medication. It differs from euthanasia, which is a third-party intervention to end a life to relieve suffering, such as when a doctor administers the lethal dose. In Switzerland, assisted suicide is allowed only if the person assisting acts unselfishly. It is the only country with centres offering assisted suicide to foreign nationals The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg permit euthanasia and assisted suicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is available to minors in specific instances Colombia allows euthanasia The US states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, California, Colorado and Hawaii permit assisted dying for terminally ill patients. The US capital Washington DC implemented a similar law for the city's residents in 2017 Canada followed the province of Quebec in permitting euthanasia and assisted suicide in 2016 Australian scientist, 104, ends life 'happy' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Author steps in to save reading schemeJojo Moyes stumps up Â£360,000 to keep the under-threat Quick Reads adult literacy scheme going.11h11 hours agoEntertainment & ArtsComments","Jojo Moyes said it was ""vital"" that Quick Reads kept going Author Jojo Moyes has stumped up funds to save an adult literacy scheme from closure after it lost its sponsorship. Moyes, whose books include the best-selling Me Before You, will fund the Â£360,000 budget to keep the Quick Reads scheme going for another three years. The initiative has distributed 4.8 million copies of short novels by big-name authors since it began in 2006. She said: ""Every now and then you have to make a decision about whether you're going to make a difference somewhere."" This video can not be played Jojo Moyes: ""They're really good books, they're just a little bit more accessible."" Quick Reads commissions high-profile authors to write novels that are aimed at people with lower literacy levels as well as those who may have little time for reading or have fallen out of the habit. They are sold for Â£1 and are distributed to libraries, prisons, colleges, hospitals and adult learning organisations. Moyes contributed a story, Paris For One, in 2015, and other authors who have taken part include Andy McNab, Jeffrey Archer, Malala, Roddy Doyle, Mark Billingham and Fern Britton. Moyes told BBC News it was a ""really effective low-cost method of improving the reading skills and enjoyment"" of less confident readers and others. She said the decision to end it was ""a really short-sighted measure at a time when libraries are closing"". Jojo Moyes: Modern dating is a 'road of misery' Quick Reads was sponsored by chocolate company Galaxy from 2010-16. They provided limited support last year but then pulled out completely, and publishers and private donors chipped in to keep it going this year. But a search for a new sponsor proved fruitless and the scheme was due to be wound up. However, with Moyes' backing, it will now resume from 2020-23. She said: ""I talked to my husband over a long weekend and did some diligence, but the more we spoke to people who had been involved in it, the more we felt it was vital that it continued. ""My aim is to buy them a window, if you like, so we can put other long-term funding in place at the end of three years. ""I just don't think this is a scheme should fail because it's a win for authors, it's a win for publishers and it's certainly a win for readers."" The scheme is run by The Reading Agency, whose chief executive Sue Wilkinson said: ""It was with a heavy heart that we announced the end of Quick Reads last month, after seeking ongoing support for the initiative for 18 months. ""We couldn't be more thankful to Jojo for recognising the importance of the scheme and so generously providing the funding to enable it to continue. ""The moving testimonies from the public, authors and all of our partners last month demonstrated how much they value these wonderful books and how Quick Reads have touched so many people's lives.""

"'Israel-Iran' fight flares up in SyriaIsrael launches a massive wave of strikes on Iranian forces in Syria, after coming under rocket fire.","This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus Israel says it has struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria in its biggest assault since the start of the civil war there. The strikes came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights overnight. Syria's military said the Israeli ""aggression"" had killed three people. There was no immediate comment from Iran, whose deployment of troops to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad has alarmed Israel. Iran has repeatedly called for an end to the existence of the Jewish state. Russia, Germany and France called on both countries to exercise restraint, but the US said Iran bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions"" and that Israel had a right to defend itself. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts there by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, confirmed that rockets were fired towards the occupied Golan. But it said the attack came after Israeli forces bombarded Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone. Israeli forces in the occupied Golan Heights have been on high alert since Tuesday night A senior source in an Iranian-led military alliance that supports Syria's government also told AFP news agency that Israeli forces had fired first. Col Conricus said fighter jets had struck 70 military targets belonging to Iran inside Syria, causing significant damage. The targets included: Intelligence sites associated with Iran and its proxies A logistics headquarters belonging to the Quds Force A military logistics compound in Kiswah, a town south of Damascus An Iranian military compound north of Damascus Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport Intelligence systems and posts associated with the Quds Force Observation and military posts and munitions in the Golan demilitarised zone The IDF said it had also targeted Syrian military air defence systems after they fired at the fighter jets despite an Israeli ""warning"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman later told a conference in the town of Herzliya that the IDF had ""hit almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"". ""They must remember that if it rains here [in Israel], it will pour there,"" he said. ""I hope that we have finished this chapter and that everyone got the message."" Israel's defence minister said it had ""no interest in escalation"" following the strikes However, Syria's military declared it had ""thwarted a new Israeli act of aggression"" and that its air defences ""destroyed a large part"" of the missile barrage. Three people were killed by the missiles, a spokesman said. A radar station and an ammunition depot were also destroyed, and several air defence bases sustained damage, he added. Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained The Syrian Observatory reported that at least 23 people were killed, including five Syrian soldiers and 18 other allied fighters. Russia, which is also supporting the Syrian military, said Israel fired 60 air-to-surface and 10 surface-to-surface missiles and that more than half were shot down. By Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent, BBC News These events have tactical and strategic dimensions. In the short-term the Iranians are seeking ""pay back"" for an Israeli strike against one of their bases in Syria a little over a month ago. On Wednesday night, according to the Israeli military, Iran's Quds Force launched rockets against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. But the scale of the attack was limited - a single multiple-barrel rocket launcher appears to have been used, which the Israelis say they subsequently destroyed. They then apparently hit every Iranian facility they know of in Syria to send a powerful message to Tehran. But neither Israel nor Iran appear to want an all-out war at this stage. Nonetheless their strategic rivalry is clear. Tehran is seeking to establish itself as a military player in Syria to open up another potential front against Israel. And Israel is equally determined to prevent this. Will there be a war between Israel and Iran? Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are determined to stop what they consider Iranian ""military entrenchment"" in the country. Iran has deployed hundreds of troops, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. This video can not be played Tzipi Hotovely: Iran should 'stay away' from Syria Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Mr Netanyahu's lobbying against the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which US President Donald Trump abandoned on Tuesday, has raised tensions further with Tehran. Mr Lieberman stressed that while Israel had ""no interest in escalation"", it had to ""be prepared for any scenario"". ""We are facing a new reality where Iran is attacking Israel directly and trying to harm Israel's sovereignty and territories,"" he added. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

The Golan Heights explained,"The Golan Heights is  a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 60km (40 miles) south-west of Damascus and covers about 1,000 sq km. It has a political and strategic significance which belies its size. Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War. Most of the Syrian Arab inhabitants fled the area during the conflict. An armistice line was established and the region came under Israeli military control. Almost immediately Israel began to settle the Golan. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Syria tried to retake the Golan Heights during the 1973 Middle East war. Despite inflicting heavy losses on Israeli forces, the surprise assault was thwarted. Both countries signed an armistice in 1974 and a UN observer force has been in place on the ceasefire line since 1974. Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US Trump Administration did so unilaterally in March 2019. There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured. Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. While still under Syrian control, the Golan Heights were used to bombard Israeli territory below Southern Syria and the capital Damascus, about 60 km (40 miles) north, are clearly visible from the top of the Heights while Syrian artillery regularly shelled the whole of northern Israel from 1948 to 1967 when Syria controlled the Heights. The heights give Israel an excellent vantage point for monitoring Syrian movements. The topography provides a natural buffer against any military thrust from Syria. The area is also a key source of water for an arid region. Rainwater from the Golan's catchment feeds into the Jordan River. The land is fertile, and the volcanic soil is used to cultivate vineyards and orchards and raise cattle. The Golan is also home to Israel's only ski resort. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 Syria wants to secure the return of the Golan Heights as part of any peace deal. In late 2003, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he was ready to revive peace talks with Israel. In Israel, the principle of returning the territory in return for peace is already established. During US-brokered peace talks in 1999-2000, then Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak had offered to return most of the Golan to Syria. But the main sticking point during the 1999 talks is also likely to bedevil any future discussions. Syria wants a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 border. This would give Damascus control of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee - Israel's main source of fresh water. Israeli troops exercise on Mount Hermon, which Israelis enjoy using for winter sports Israel wishes to retain control of Galilee and says the border is located a few hundred metres to the east of the shore. A deal with Syria would also involve the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the territory. Public opinion in Israel has generally not favoured withdrawal, saying the Heights are too strategically important to be returned. Indirect talks between Israel and Syria resumed in 2008, through Turkish government intermediaries, but were suspended following the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert over a corruption inquiry. The Israeli government under Binyamin Netanyahu elected in February 2009 indicated that it was determined to take a tougher line over the Golan, and in June 2009 Syria said there was no partner for talks on the Israeli side. The US administration of President Barack Obama declared the restarting of talks between Israel and Syria to be one of its main foreign policy goals, but the advent of civil war in Syria in 2011 put paid to any progress. Syrian fighting reached the Golan ceasefire lines in 2013, but the resurgent Syrian government felt confident enough to reopen its Golan border crossing to UN observers in October 2018. In 2019, US President Donald Trump officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Syria criticised the move as ""a blatant attack on its sovereignty"".

Bank to reveal interest rate decision,"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is set to decide later whether to raise rates from 0.5%. Economists believe the Bank will not increase the cost of borrowing after a slowdown in UK economic growth in the first quarter of the year. Last month, Bank governor Mark Carney said ""mixed"" economic data could delay any increase. Rates rose for the first time in more than 10 years in November, from 0.25%. The Bank is also expected to downgrade its economic growth forecasts. The economy expanded at its slowest pace in five years in the first three months of 2018. Gross domestic product grew by 0.1%, down from a rate of 0.4% in the previous three months, with the severe weather caused by the Beast from the East affecting the retail and construction sectors in particular. The prediction would signal a change of thinking for the Bank. Last month, one forecasting body, the EY Item Club, had predictedtwo rate rises this year. The Bank is expected to cut its 2018 growth forecast from the 1.8% predicted in its quarterly report in February and also lower inflation predictions. Wages have started to overtake inflation and Howard Archer, the EY Item Club's chief economic adviser, believes an August rise may be the only one this year, if it happens. ""If the Bank of England does cut the near-term GDP growth and inflation forecasts, but leave the longer-term projections unchanged, it would point to the gradual tightening of monetary policy being delayed rather than abandoned,"" he said. Gloom on the High Street is likely to stay the Bank's hand In an interview with the BBC in April, Mr Carney all but extinguished expectations of a rate rise by saying that some of the economic data had shown signs of weakening. ""I am sure there will be some differences of view but it is a view we will take in early May [at the next meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee], conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year,"" he said. Investment firm Investec believes any decision to hold rates will not be unanimous among the MPC members. It predicts a 7-2 vote in favour of no rise, with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders the only committee members expected to want an increase after calling for one in March. ""With a rate hike now seemingly off the table, the market will be focused on the rationale for the BoE's abrupt U-turn, having signalled a rate hike in March,"" said Investec. ""Softer data looks to have played a part, but with the first quarter seemingly impacted by poor weather, investors will be keenly waiting to see if the BoE believes there is a more fundamental slowdown afoot and what the chances are for a rate hike later this year."" Borrowing slows ahead of rate decision Interest rates 'to rise twice this year' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

App allows medics to view 999 patients,"A doctor viewing a 999 caller A new app which allows air ambulance services to view patients before they arrive to treat them is being trialled in two areas of England. The GoodSam app sends a link to the 999 caller's mobile phone, which opens live streaming. Medics can then assess how seriously ill a patient is before setting off. Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance and Great North Air Ambulance Service are currently testing the system, and results so far have been promising. Prof Richard Lyon, associate medical director of Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance, said: ""It's game-changing."" He added: ""Time is critical in saving a person's life or reducing long-term disability, and often we have limited information from bystanders about a patient's or multiple patients' injuries to make decisions. ""Being able to see the scene of the incident, not only the patients, but how many cars are involved for example, can help us decide what additional resources we might need to send, assess who we might need to treat first or what medication we might need to give,"" he said. Watch an earlier version of the app in action The trial of the app has been running for two months. Prof Mark Wilson, medical director of the company which made the app, said they did not yet have hard data on results. However, he said giving doctors the opportunity to see someone's burn, for example, would allow them to make an early assessment. He added: ""The data doesn't remain on the patients' mobile phone. It only streams when they give permission and then once streamed it has gone."" Currently there are no plans to expand the service in the UK, but discussions are under way to trial the technology in remote locations in Africa, where emergency services can be hours away. 999 crews 'should share control rooms' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"BT cuts 13,000 jobs to slash costsThe telecoms giant will axe many back-office and middle management roles in the next three years.1han hour agoBusiness","BT is to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, about 12% of its workforce, as it seeks to slim down its management and back-office roles. The telecoms giant said,externalthat the job cuts and other measures would help it to reduce costs by Â£1.5bn. It added that it would be hiring about 6,000 employees to ""support network deployment and customer service"". A third of the job reductions will come from outside the UK in its Global Services division. Last year, BT was forced to write down the value of the Italian part of Global Services afteran accounting scandal that cost the firm more than Â£500m. The company also said it intended to move out of its existing central London headquarters and into smaller premises. BT forecast a fall in revenue of about 2% for the 2018-19 financial year. It also said it was keeping its full-year dividend unchanged from last year at 15.4p a share and would freeze it for the next two years. Shares in BT fell nearly 8% in early trading. Philippa Childs, national secretary of the Prospect union, said the announcement was ""a devastating blow to managers and professionals represented by Prospect"". She said Prospect had been working closely with BT on looking at the impact of organisational changes, but the number of job cuts sounded ""unrealistic"". BT said it was responding to changes in the telecoms market, including ""increasing competitive intensity from established companies and new entrants"". ""It is critical that BT transforms its operating model to build a lean and agile organisation that delivers sustained improvement in customer experience and productivity,"" it said. The announcements came as BT disclosed that its annual pre-tax profits rose 11% to Â£2.6bn in the year to March. The firm also announced a 13-year plan to plug its Â£11.3bn pension fund deficit, including regular payments into the scheme and a bond issue. Chief executive Gavin Patterson said BT was in a unique position: ""We have the UK's leading fixed and mobile access networks, a portfolio of strong and well segmented brands, and close strategic partnerships. ""This position of strength will enable us to build on the disciplined delivery and risk reduction of the last financial year, a period in which we delivered overall in line with our financial and operational commitments whilst addressing many uncertainties."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the job cuts and HQ move were ""drastic actions"", but added that they ""still aren't going to be enough to dig BT out the hole it's in"". ""The dividend, which was rising 10% a year not so long ago, is set to freeze for the foreseeable future, and next year's profits look likely to fall again,"" he added. ""There are silver linings here and there. For example, EE and the consumer businesses continue to grow. However, these improvements are being more than offset by challenging conditions elsewhere. ""Openreach terms are getting tougher, and the business-to-business and global divisions are having a torrid time. Gavin Patterson will have his work cut out if he's to steady the ship."" BT's share price has halved over the past two years. Investors have become less convinced about the company's ability to make them money, after an accounting scandal, a profits warning and a regulatory fine. BT clearly thinks it has too many staff doing jobs not needed in the digital world. Its wide-ranging corporate shake-up is an attempt to simplify the business, to squeeze more profit out of each pound it spends. It's under pressure to pump more money into fibre optic and super-fast mobile networks and to fill the black hole in its pension scheme. It has made more efforts on those fronts today. Thousands of new hires will be engineers and cyber-experts, focusing not on copper cables, but on building the physical and mobile networks of the future. It's also trying to improve its customer service and mend relations with the regulator. It's a big job, turning a former monopoly into a consumer-focused TV and phone company. Shares are down sharply, suggesting investors are yet to be convinced by BT's plan.

Many firms still 'breaking gender pay law',"This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? Hundreds of companies face legal action after failing to meet an extended deadline to report their gender pay gap, Britain's equality watchdog said. Companies with more than 250 staff must now publish the details on their own websites and on a government site. Many did this only after the Equality and Human Rights Commission began enforcement action last month. EHRC head Rebecca Hilsenrath said there would be ""zero tolerance"" of firms that failed to comply. Ms Hilsenrath said: ""Last month, we contacted almost 1,500 businesses to commence enforcement proceedings and as a result the number of employers facing investigation is now under 500."" ""Breach of these regulations is breaking the law and we've always been clear we will enforce with zero tolerance."" Try our gender pay gap calculator Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap 'Huge rise in working mums' since 1970s What is the gender pay gap at your company? The Commission did not give an exact figure for the number of companies it was still chasing. About 11,000 employers had published their pay details by the extended deadline, which expired on Monday. The disclosure law, introduced last year, requires firms and charities with 250 or more staff - covering almost half the population - to report their gender pay gap each year by April 4. The EHRC statement came as think tank the Institute for Public Policy Researchpublished a report on the UK's gender pay gap,externaland suggested employers should urge more men to work fewer hours or work flexibly. IPRR's research found 81% of occupations had a pay gap. The biggest difference between men's and women's pay was for those over 40 - a difference which then continues for the rest of their working lives. The report says changing men's working behaviour is ""crucial"" to closing the gender pay gap, recommending employers introduce ""use it or lose it"" paid paternity leave and encourage more men to take up job shares. To help women - who it says have a ""lower propensity"" to negotiate their pay - the report suggests employers either rule out salary negotiation altogether or explicitly state in job adverts that pay is negotiable. Male workers earn on average 18.4% more than women, according to government data published last year. Companies are not required to break down the data in detail, leading to criticism that the average figures could obscure or exaggerate demographic explanations for disparities. The Fawcett Society, which lobbies for gender equality, said last month that reporting was ""a game changer in terms of workplace culture and practices"". But it warned that enforcement would be a ""disproportionately drawn-out process"".

'Huge destruction' as Kenya dam bursts,"This video can not be played The search-and-rescue effort is under way in Kenya At least 41 people have died after heavy rains caused a dam to burst in Kenya, sweeping away homes across a vast area of farmland. The breach happened on Wednesday near the town of Solai, 190km (120 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi. The dead are thought to include children and women trapped in mud. The Kenyan Red Cross says it has rescued about 40 people so far. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless. Local officials say the full extent of the damage is not yet clear. There are fears the death toll could rise as the search-and-rescue operation continues. Latest updates on the dam burst The heavy rains in Kenya and other regional states come after a severe drought which left millions of people in need of food aid. The dead included children and women trapped in the mud Eleven bodies, mostly of women and children, were recovered at a coffee plantation, an unnamed police officer told AFP news agency. It seemed that they had been fleeing but ""could not make it due to the force and speed of the water from the flooded dam"", the officer added. More than 2,000 people are said to have been left homeless The Patel dam, located on private farmland, and reportedly used for irrigation and fish farming, broke its walls and swept away hundreds of homes downstream. Much of the area was completely devastated as power lines, homes and buildings were carried away by the fast-running water. A secondary school was also flooded, while a primary school was swept away. By Anne Soy, BBC News, Solai Torrential rains are continuing to fall, hampering rescue efforts. Shocked and grieving survivors are sheltering under the canopies of remaining buildings. Foundation slabs of the swept away buildings are lying exposed along a wide path, created by the raging water. There is a deep gully running down the hill from where Patel dam burst. Household items, boulders and mangled iron sheets are strewn across the flood path. Kenya Red Cross volunteers, the police, and military officers are at the scene. It is being described as the biggest tragedy in Kenya since heavy rain started nearly two months ago. The bodies of two women were discovered several miles away from the area affected by the bursting of the dam, the Reuters news agency reported. Witnesses said they heard a loud bang before the waves swept through nearly 2km (1.2 miles) of farmland where many people live and work. On Thursday, rescue workers brandishing shovels scoured through the rubble and mud, searching for survivors and victims ""The water has caused huge destruction of both life and property. The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained,"" said Lee Kinyajui, governor of Nakuru County. Miriam Karimi told AFP she had not been able to find her three children in the aftermath, including her four-year-old son. ""I'm so confused. I hope they are alive,"" she said. Survivor Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, told Reuters that she was at home brewing tea when her son's wife rushed in to say they needed to get to higher ground as the dam had burst. ""It was a sea of water. My neighbour was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,"" she was quoted as saying. ""My other neighbours also died. All our houses have been ruined,"" Ms Ngigi added. The Patel dam is one of three reservoirs owned by a large-scale farmer in the area. Its walls are said to have caved in due to the high volumes of water following heavy rains that have been pounding the country. The flood swept through farmland, wrecking homes in its wake The burst dam was ""a sea of water,"" one survivor said And it is still raining Local leaders are now seeking to find out whether the farmer was licensed to erect those dams, amid concerns about the condition of the remaining two which are also said to be full, reports the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi. He has not yet commented. Before Wednesday's disaster, 132 people have died countrywide as a result of heavy rains since March, according to official statistics. More than 220,000 people have also had their homes destroyed.

Author steps in to save reading scheme,"Jojo Moyes said it was ""vital"" that Quick Reads kept going Author Jojo Moyes has stumped up funds to save an adult literacy scheme from closure after it lost its sponsorship. Moyes, whose books include the best-selling Me Before You, will fund the Â£360,000 budget to keep the Quick Reads scheme going for another three years. The initiative has distributed 4.8 million copies of short novels by big-name authors since it began in 2006. She said: ""Every now and then you have to make a decision about whether you're going to make a difference somewhere."" This video can not be played Jojo Moyes: ""They're really good books, they're just a little bit more accessible."" Quick Reads commissions high-profile authors to write novels that are aimed at people with lower literacy levels as well as those who may have little time for reading or have fallen out of the habit. They are sold for Â£1 and are distributed to libraries, prisons, colleges, hospitals and adult learning organisations. Moyes contributed a story, Paris For One, in 2015, and other authors who have taken part include Andy McNab, Jeffrey Archer, Malala, Roddy Doyle, Mark Billingham and Fern Britton. Moyes told BBC News it was a ""really effective low-cost method of improving the reading skills and enjoyment"" of less confident readers and others. She said the decision to end it was ""a really short-sighted measure at a time when libraries are closing"". Jojo Moyes: Modern dating is a 'road of misery' Quick Reads was sponsored by chocolate company Galaxy from 2010-16. They provided limited support last year but then pulled out completely, and publishers and private donors chipped in to keep it going this year. But a search for a new sponsor proved fruitless and the scheme was due to be wound up. However, with Moyes' backing, it will now resume from 2020-23. She said: ""I talked to my husband over a long weekend and did some diligence, but the more we spoke to people who had been involved in it, the more we felt it was vital that it continued. ""My aim is to buy them a window, if you like, so we can put other long-term funding in place at the end of three years. ""I just don't think this is a scheme should fail because it's a win for authors, it's a win for publishers and it's certainly a win for readers."" The scheme is run by The Reading Agency, whose chief executive Sue Wilkinson said: ""It was with a heavy heart that we announced the end of Quick Reads last month, after seeking ongoing support for the initiative for 18 months. ""We couldn't be more thankful to Jojo for recognising the importance of the scheme and so generously providing the funding to enable it to continue. ""The moving testimonies from the public, authors and all of our partners last month demonstrated how much they value these wonderful books and how Quick Reads have touched so many people's lives.""

Warning of rising food bills after Brexit,"The UK imports roughly half its food - nearly a third of which originates from the EU Food bills could rise sharply if there is no free trade deal with the European Union after Brexit, peers have warned. The Lords EU Environment Committee said it was ""inconceivable"" there would be no impact on EU produce, which makes up 30% of the UK's food imports. While better-off customers could afford to buy more expensive home-grown goods, it said, those on lower incomes could be left with lower-quality imports. Officials said the UK's aim was to ensure the ""smooth flow"" of goods. Brexit-supporting MPs say leaving the EU could reduce food prices by removing unnecessary regulation on UK farmers and cutting tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. But the cross-party committee said it was unclear whether the government's primary goal after Brexit was reducing food prices, or maintaining high animal welfare and food safety standards. Reality Check: The government's customs options The future of farming after Brexit Farm subsidies 'to help environment' In the event of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 without any deal, it said, the UK could face an average 22% tariff on food imports from the Continent. ""While this would not equate to a 22% increase in food prices for consumers, there can be no doubt that prices paid at the checkout would rise,"" it said. ""To counteract this, the government could cut tariffs on all food imports, EU and non-EU, but this would pose a serious risk of undermining UK food producers who could not compete on price."" The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is expected to discuss issues relating to agriculture and food production on Thursday. Half the UK's food is imported, with 30% from the EU, 11% from countries with EU trade deals and the rest from other countries. The committee said there was a ""striking"" contrast between the government's apparent confidence over the risk of disruption to food supplies and the ""vocal"" concerns of industry and consumer bodies. The UK has said it wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU and a customs arrangement that continues to ensure ""frictionless"" trade. Few freight companies are aware of what will happen after Brexit, the industry suggests But the government has not yet said what post-Brexit customs arrangement it wants with the EU, with divisions in the cabinet over whether to seek a close ""customs partnership"" that would not need new border checks or a looser model that would lead to some new checks. The committee warned the UK's ports would be clogged up if EU goods were subject to the same border checks as other imported produce. Yet, it said, allowing produce through with few checks would raise safety concerns. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, said food producers and customs officials must be given time to prepare for any changes and consumers reassured that supplies would continue as normal. After Brexit, British farmers will continue to receive the same level of subsidies they currently get through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. This will continue until 2022. But the committee said it would not be possible to increase food production in time to meet any shortfall caused by Brexit. It said any reductions in EU workers could lead to an increase in recruitment or higher wages for domestic workers but the costs may have to be passed on to customers or some businesses ""may cease to be viable"". The Freight Transport Association said the ""paralysis"" at Dover and on the surrounding road network caused by the French ferry workers' strike in 2015 could be repeated if no customs solutions were found. ""The government understands this... so it must be why they are taking so long to make up their minds,"" said Pauline Bastidon, the organisation's head of European Policy. Most companies had no idea what the impact of Brexit would be on their business, she said. ""It's surprising to see how little advanced companies are in terms of mapping their flows and looking at what their exposure is,"" said Ms Bastidon. ""Only a few are starting to fully realise the impact that Brexit will have on their business."" A government spokeswoman said the cost of food depended on range of factors, including commodity prices,  exchange rates and oil prices, and this would still apply after Brexit. She added: ""But we also want to ensure consumers have access to a wide range of food, which is why we are considering how we best manage border checks and controls when we leave the EU without impacting the smooth flow of trade.""

Five charged with animal cruelty over cubs,"Secret footage was taken of the South Herefordshire Hunt's kennels Five people are to be charged with animal cruelty offences after the BBC broadcast pictures appearing to show fox cubs being taken into a kennel of hunting hounds. The police investigation began after anti-hunting activists installed hidden cameras at the South Herefordshire Hunt kennels in 2016. The video appears to show a man then dumping a dead fox cub in a bin. The activists say the cubs were used to give hounds a taste for killing. Midlands Live: Man charged with wife's murder; Council boss set for 50% pay rise Anti-hunt investigators found some of the foxes alive Campaigners had been expected to protest outside a police station later this week over how long the investigation was taking. Det Insp Jonathan Roberts, of West Mercia Police, said the three men and two women, aged between 29 and 54, would face multiple charges of animal cruelty. ""This follows a complex investigation in South Herefordshire. The individuals will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Tuesday May 15,"" he said.

Malaysia set to have world's oldest leader,"Dr Mahathir has indicated he may only serve two years Mahathir Mohamad has been sworn in as prime minister of Malaysia after his shock election victory, 15 years after he stood down. After taking the oath at the Istana Negara palace in Kuala Lumpur, he told reporters his focus would be on the country's finances. The former strongman has become, at 92, the world's oldest elected leader. He came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protege Najib Razak. His historic win ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'The biggest mistake in my life' 'There are two types of age' Dr Mahathir took his oath of office before the king, Sultan Muhammad V. The new prime minister was accompanied by his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohammed Ali. This video can not be played Malaysian voters react in 2018 to Mahathir Mohamad's victory over Najib Razak Addressing the media, he pledged that Malaysia would remain a ""friendly trading nation"" and he would work to keep the currency, the ringgit, as ""steady as possible"". He said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in a corruption scandal at 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund set up by Mr Najib. ""We believe that we can get most of the 1MDB money back,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, adding: ""We have to increase the confidence of investors in the administration."" He renewed his promise to seek to have his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, released and pardoned. When Dr Mahathir was previously in power, Anwar was jailed for corruption and sodomy after calling for economic and political reforms. He was released in 2004 but jailed again under Mr Najib in 2015. He is currently due for release next month. Investment analyst Aninda Mitra told Reuters news agency the shock of the election outcome had been as great as ""Brexit and the Trump election"". Official results show Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats. Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption had weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition. ""We feel so united tonight,"" student Abdul Aziz Hamzah, 24, told AFP news agency in the crowd of jubilant supporters  outside the palace. ""Mahathir is so insightful and experienced because he's been here before."" Mahathir supporters waved flags outside the Istana Negara palace Fahmi Fadzil, an MP from the winning coalition, told the BBC Dr Mahathir inspired excitement about Malaysia's future. ""Today he has created, along with other Pakatan Harapan leaders, a resurgence in faith in Malaysia,"" he said. ""The polling centres that I visited, there was a sense of euphoria among people who cast their vote. Members of the press that I had met, some of them said that they cried when they heard that we had won. ""There is very real change happening in Malaysia. Finally we can believe in the country again.""

He was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003. Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. However, he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents. Dr Mahathir was also a mentor to Mr Najib, who became prime minister in 2008. Mr Najib (L) was a former protege of Dr Mahathir (C) But Mr Najib was accused of pocketing some $700m (Â£520m) from the 1MDB but vehemently denied the allegations and was cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund, meanwhile, is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib was also accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their posts. Tainted political aristocrat Those allegations led to Dr Mahathir's surprise defection in 2016 from BN to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was ""embarrassed"" to be associated ""with a party that is seen as supporting corruption"". Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again. But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent This morning Malaysia has woken to an entirely new situation, the first transfer of power in its history, albeit to a very familiar leader. But there are huge unknowns. How willingly will BN, the coalition which has, in various forms, run the country since independence and embedded itself into all areas of governance, relinquish power? How well will a disparate coalition, united largely by their desire to oust Najib Razak, work together in government? How smoothly will the plan to gain a pardon for imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and then for Mr Mahathir to hand the premiership to him within two years, actually proceed? And how will they treat Mr Najib, and his high-spending wife, both accused of greed and corruption? After all the jubilation over an impressive act of defiance by Malaysian voters, there is a mountain of challenges to face.

N Korea crisis in 300 words,"Despite two summits in 2018 and 2019, and then a historic meeting at the Korean border, the future of the US-North Korea talks look bleak. Here's an overview of a saga that has at times threatened nuclear war. The Korean peninsula was divided after World War Two and the North developed an authoritarian form of government. Isolated globally, it saw nuclear weapons as a deterrent against a world it believed was seeking to destroy it. Probably. Pyongyang has carried out six nuclear tests. It claims, though this remains unverified, to have developed a nuclear bombsmall enough for a long-range missile. It also has a ballistic missile experts believe could reach the US, and in 2019 tested a missile that could carry a nuclear weapon and belaunched from a submarine. At the start of 2020, Kim Jong-un ended the country'smoratorium on nuclear testing. After months of escalating mutual threats, in January 2018Mr Kim said he was ""open to dialogue"". Mr Trump accepted, ignoring past pre-talk conditions that North Korea denuclearise first. On 12 June 2018,Mr Trump became the first sitting president to meet a North Korean leader. The two signed an agreement committing to the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" but with no detail on what that meant. Since then, there has been little progress, despite more talks. The US wants North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons while Pyongyang wants a step-by-step approach to ease the crippling sanctions regime. The most recent talks between officials, though not leaders, took place in Sweden in October 2019. The US said ""good discussions were had"" but North Korea said the US""brought nothing to the negotiation table"". Since then, North Korea hascontinued missile testing., while the US has urgedPyongyang to resume talks.

Golan Heights profile,"The Golan Heights is  a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 60km (40 miles) south-west of Damascus and covers about 1,000 sq km. It has a political and strategic significance which belies its size. Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War. Most of the Syrian Arab inhabitants fled the area during the conflict. An armistice line was established and the region came under Israeli military control. Almost immediately Israel began to settle the Golan. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Syria tried to retake the Golan Heights during the 1973 Middle East war. Despite inflicting heavy losses on Israeli forces, the surprise assault was thwarted. Both countries signed an armistice in 1974 and a UN observer force has been in place on the ceasefire line since 1974. Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US Trump Administration did so unilaterally in March 2019. There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured. Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. While still under Syrian control, the Golan Heights were used to bombard Israeli territory below Southern Syria and the capital Damascus, about 60 km (40 miles) north, are clearly visible from the top of the Heights while Syrian artillery regularly shelled the whole of northern Israel from 1948 to 1967 when Syria controlled the Heights. The heights give Israel an excellent vantage point for monitoring Syrian movements. The topography provides a natural buffer against any military thrust from Syria. The area is also a key source of water for an arid region. Rainwater from the Golan's catchment feeds into the Jordan River. The land is fertile, and the volcanic soil is used to cultivate vineyards and orchards and raise cattle. The Golan is also home to Israel's only ski resort. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 Syria wants to secure the return of the Golan Heights as part of any peace deal. In late 2003, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he was ready to revive peace talks with Israel. In Israel, the principle of returning the territory in return for peace is already established. During US-brokered peace talks in 1999-2000, then Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak had offered to return most of the Golan to Syria. But the main sticking point during the 1999 talks is also likely to bedevil any future discussions. Syria wants a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 border. This would give Damascus control of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee - Israel's main source of fresh water. Israeli troops exercise on Mount Hermon, which Israelis enjoy using for winter sports Israel wishes to retain control of Galilee and says the border is located a few hundred metres to the east of the shore. A deal with Syria would also involve the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the territory. Public opinion in Israel has generally not favoured withdrawal, saying the Heights are too strategically important to be returned. Indirect talks between Israel and Syria resumed in 2008, through Turkish government intermediaries, but were suspended following the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert over a corruption inquiry. The Israeli government under Binyamin Netanyahu elected in February 2009 indicated that it was determined to take a tougher line over the Golan, and in June 2009 Syria said there was no partner for talks on the Israeli side. The US administration of President Barack Obama declared the restarting of talks between Israel and Syria to be one of its main foreign policy goals, but the advent of civil war in Syria in 2011 put paid to any progress. Syrian fighting reached the Golan ceasefire lines in 2013, but the resurgent Syrian government felt confident enough to reopen its Golan border crossing to UN observers in October 2018. In 2019, US President Donald Trump officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Syria criticised the move as ""a blatant attack on its sovereignty"".

"'Israel-Iran' fight flares up in SyriaIsrael says it has hit Iranian infrastructure in Syria, after rockets were fired at the Golan Heights.","This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus Israel says it has struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria in its biggest assault since the start of the civil war there. The strikes came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights overnight. Syria's military said the Israeli ""aggression"" had killed three people. There was no immediate comment from Iran, whose deployment of troops to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad has alarmed Israel. Iran has repeatedly called for an end to the existence of the Jewish state. Russia, Germany and France called on both countries to exercise restraint, but the US said Iran bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions"" and that Israel had a right to defend itself. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts there by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, confirmed that rockets were fired towards the occupied Golan. But it said the attack came after Israeli forces bombarded Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone. Israeli forces in the occupied Golan Heights have been on high alert since Tuesday night A senior source in an Iranian-led military alliance that supports Syria's government also told AFP news agency that Israeli forces had fired first. Col Conricus said fighter jets had struck 70 military targets belonging to Iran inside Syria, causing significant damage. The targets included: Intelligence sites associated with Iran and its proxies A logistics headquarters belonging to the Quds Force A military logistics compound in Kiswah, a town south of Damascus An Iranian military compound north of Damascus Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport Intelligence systems and posts associated with the Quds Force Observation and military posts and munitions in the Golan demilitarised zone The IDF said it had also targeted Syrian military air defence systems after they fired at the fighter jets despite an Israeli ""warning"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman later told a conference in the town of Herzliya that the IDF had ""hit almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"". ""They must remember that if it rains here [in Israel], it will pour there,"" he said. ""I hope that we have finished this chapter and that everyone got the message."" Israel's defence minister said it had ""no interest in escalation"" following the strikes However, Syria's military declared it had ""thwarted a new Israeli act of aggression"" and that its air defences ""destroyed a large part"" of the missile barrage. Three people were killed by the missiles, a spokesman said. A radar station and an ammunition depot were also destroyed, and several air defence bases sustained damage, he added. Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained The Syrian Observatory reported that at least 23 people were killed, including five Syrian soldiers and 18 other allied fighters. Russia, which is also supporting the Syrian military, said Israel fired 60 air-to-surface and 10 surface-to-surface missiles and that more than half were shot down. By Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent, BBC News These events have tactical and strategic dimensions. In the short-term the Iranians are seeking ""pay back"" for an Israeli strike against one of their bases in Syria a little over a month ago. On Wednesday night, according to the Israeli military, Iran's Quds Force launched rockets against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. But the scale of the attack was limited - a single multiple-barrel rocket launcher appears to have been used, which the Israelis say they subsequently destroyed. They then apparently hit every Iranian facility they know of in Syria to send a powerful message to Tehran. But neither Israel nor Iran appear to want an all-out war at this stage. Nonetheless their strategic rivalry is clear. Tehran is seeking to establish itself as a military player in Syria to open up another potential front against Israel. And Israel is equally determined to prevent this. Will there be a war between Israel and Iran? Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are determined to stop what they consider Iranian ""military entrenchment"" in the country. Iran has deployed hundreds of troops, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. This video can not be played Tzipi Hotovely: Iran should 'stay away' from Syria Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Mr Netanyahu's lobbying against the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which US President Donald Trump abandoned on Tuesday, has raised tensions further with Tehran. Mr Lieberman stressed that while Israel had ""no interest in escalation"", it had to ""be prepared for any scenario"". ""We are facing a new reality where Iran is attacking Israel directly and trying to harm Israel's sovereignty and territories,"" he added. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

Who are the US detainees?,"One of the three men who have been reportedly relocated, Kim Dong-chul, was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour after appearing before the media to confess in March 2016 Three Americans detained in North Korea are on their way home after being released in what is likely to be a goodwill gesture ahead of unprecedented talks between the leaders of US and North Korea. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting."" Their release came after a meeting between Mr Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Just asking! Trump floats Korea border idea The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? A White House statement said the three men appeared to be in good health and were able to walk on to their plane unassisted. The only other US prisoner to be released by North Korea under Donald Trump's presidency was university student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the US in a coma and died days later. Two of the newly released detainees were jailed in 2017, after Mr Trump became president. Here is what we know about the three men. Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST)and was held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" on 6 May 2017. He was reportedly detained while in Pyongyang Station. The university, which mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite, was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities. Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach there. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim. He is, reports say, an ethnic Korean born just across the North Korean border in China who emigrated to the US in the 1990s. He is said to have gone on to study agriculture in Yanbian, a Chinese prefecture which borders North Korea, before moving to Pyongyang. Two weeks before Kim Hak-song was arrested, Kim Sang-duk - also known as Tony Kim -was detained on espionage charges. He was trying to leave the country after spending a month working at PUST. South Korean media said he was 55 and had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. ""Some officials at PUST told me his arrest was not related to his work at PUST,"" the chancellor of the university, Chan-Mo Park, told Reuters news agency. Tony Kim was detained on espionage charges ""He had been involved with some other activities outside PUST, such as helping an orphanage."" Mr Kim studied accounting at two American universities and had worked as an accountant in the US for more than a decade, his Facebook page says. He had also taught in Yanbian. A South Korea-born US citizen, Kim Dong-chul is a pastor in his early 60s. He was detained in 2015 on spying chargesand sentenced to 10 years' hard labour in 2016. Before his trial, he was presented at a government-arranged press conference, where he apparently confessed to stealing military secrets in collusion with South Korea - a claim rejected by Seoul. In an interview with CNN in January 2016,external, Mr Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He said he used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone near the border zone in north-east North Korea. He told CNN he had left a wife and two daughters behind in China, but had had no contact with them since his detention.

Tricky task of summit preparation,"How do you get ready for unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men. And is there time? Back in September, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to ""tame"" Donald Trump, deriding the president as a ""mentally deranged US dotard"". President Trump replied by calling Mr Kim a ""maniac"" and a ""madman"", and warning he would be ""tested like never before"". Later they traded barbs over who had a bigger nuclear button. Six months on, those high-stakes playground spats form part of a bizarre diplomatic backdrop to a summit no-one saw coming. Mr Trump surprised the world on Thursday when he announced, via a South Korean official, that he had agreed to meet Mr Kim. The major negotiating point of their meeting will be de-nuclearisation of the North Korean regime. Beyond that, little is yet known about potential objectives and concessions on either side. It is a remarkable gamble by the US president, one that would make him the first American leader to meet a North Korean counterpart. The careful choreography and delicate diplomacy required by international talks have not always come naturally to the Trump team, and now its staff have on their hands one of the most high-profile bilateral summits in US history. The talks are scheduled to take place within two months. For both sides, preparation will be key, but how do you prepare for an unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men? Reading between the lines of talks announcement The South Korean envoys behind a diplomatic breakthrough Kim's concern for South Korean leader's welfare The US will begin with key Korea positions in the state department vacant. Chief North Korea envoy Joseph Yun resigned in February and the widely expected appointment of Victor Cha as ambassador to Seoul fell through the same month, over a policy disagreement. ""I expect they are going to face a few problems,"" said Jim Hoare, a former British charge d'affaires in Pyongyang, of the American effort. ""If they had a proper apparatus to deal with East Asia, it might be different. But they have only an acting officer in charge of East Asian matters, the state department has been battered and there's no ambassador in South Korea. So I don't know who Trump is talking to about North Korea, I'm not sure anybody does."" The decision to agree to the historic meeting is said to have unfolded in an impulsive and haphazard way not uncommon to the new administration. The New York Times reports that the president, upon hearing that South Korean official Chung Eui-yong was in the White House, summoned Mr Chung to the Oval office and asked about Mr Kim. This video can not be played The South's Chung Eui-yong talks to reporters at the White House When Mr Chung said the North Korean leader wanted to meet Mr Trump, the president immediately agreed and told the South Korean official to make the announcement to the press. Not for the first time, Mr Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was caught on the hop. ""In terms of direct talks... we're a long ways from negotiations,"" Mr Tillerson had told reporters just hours before the surprise announcement. Previous presidents have resisted visiting North Korea, leery of conferring prestige on the regime. Bill Clinton reportedly considered a trip to Pyongyang in late 2000, shortly after a visit by then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had laid potential groundwork, but ultimately focused on late-term priorities elsewhere. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un ""A meeting with the US president is the coin of the realm,"" said Christopher Hill, a former US ambassador to South Korea, ""and here we have a president just prepared to do it without too many details of what the North Koreans have in mind."" But the president's oft-derided impulsiveness may prove to be an asset in this case, said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser to George W Bush. ""His style has already produced a breakthrough,"" said Mr Hadley. ""He was much criticised for rhetoric on North Korea that was viewed as irresponsible and bellicose but it got both North Korea's attention and China's attention. ""The trick now is to convince China that the status quo is not sustainable and convince North Korea that holding on to nuclear weapons might be more of a risk to their security than giving them up. ""And I think Trump's approach has had a pretty good impact in both of those directions already."" The speed of the decision leaves significant details up in the air. The location presents an interesting conundrum. Mr Kim has not left North Korea since becoming leader and is unlikely to accept an invitation to Washington. A visit by Mr Trump to Pyongyang would be a considerable PR gift to the North Koreans and is equally unlikely. ""It's going to be difficult getting the protocol right, who defers to who and under what circumstances etc, so it's important to find a place that's neutral,"" said Mr Hoare. Possible contenders include China, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas and somewhere in international waters. In 1989, George HW Bush met the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on a Soviet cruise ship off the coast of Malta. More important still than the location for Mr Trump will be a meticulous understanding of both the US and North Korean objectives. For a president known to struggle with dense briefing papers - preferring instead short, image-led presentations - preparation could be a challenge. ""If he doesn't do the homework he's going to have a problem,"" said Mr Hoare. ""He will be facing people who have been working on US matters for years and years and years. They won't speak but they will have briefed Mr Kim very thoroughly."" Another key consideration will be the way things look. The summit will take place in a media ecosystem completely different to that of 1961, when President John Kennedy met Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, or of 1972 when Richard Nixon made his famous overture to China. Every word will be covered in real time on cable news, every stray bit of body language subjected to rigorous analysis. But if Mr Trump can avoid diplomatic gaffes and get along well enough with Mr Kim, his straight-shooting style of politics may prove to be as much of an asset in dealing with North Korea as it has been a liability elsewhere. ""He has already surprised a lot of people by bringing Kim to the table,"" said Mr Hadley. ""It just might be that his unconventional style produces a surprising result from the meeting.""

"BT announces plans to cut 13,000 jobs","BT is to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, about 12% of its workforce, as it seeks to slim down its management and back-office roles. The telecoms giant said,externalthat the job cuts and other measures would help it to reduce costs by Â£1.5bn. It added that it would be hiring about 6,000 employees to ""support network deployment and customer service"". A third of the job reductions will come from outside the UK in its Global Services division. Last year, BT was forced to write down the value of the Italian part of Global Services afteran accounting scandal that cost the firm more than Â£500m. The company also said it intended to move out of its existing central London headquarters and into smaller premises. BT forecast a fall in revenue of about 2% for the 2018-19 financial year. It also said it was keeping its full-year dividend unchanged from last year at 15.4p a share and would freeze it for the next two years. Shares in BT fell nearly 8% in early trading. Philippa Childs, national secretary of the Prospect union, said the announcement was ""a devastating blow to managers and professionals represented by Prospect"". She said Prospect had been working closely with BT on looking at the impact of organisational changes, but the number of job cuts sounded ""unrealistic"". BT said it was responding to changes in the telecoms market, including ""increasing competitive intensity from established companies and new entrants"". ""It is critical that BT transforms its operating model to build a lean and agile organisation that delivers sustained improvement in customer experience and productivity,"" it said. The announcements came as BT disclosed that its annual pre-tax profits rose 11% to Â£2.6bn in the year to March. The firm also announced a 13-year plan to plug its Â£11.3bn pension fund deficit, including regular payments into the scheme and a bond issue. Chief executive Gavin Patterson said BT was in a unique position: ""We have the UK's leading fixed and mobile access networks, a portfolio of strong and well segmented brands, and close strategic partnerships. ""This position of strength will enable us to build on the disciplined delivery and risk reduction of the last financial year, a period in which we delivered overall in line with our financial and operational commitments whilst addressing many uncertainties."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the job cuts and HQ move were ""drastic actions"", but added that they ""still aren't going to be enough to dig BT out the hole it's in"". ""The dividend, which was rising 10% a year not so long ago, is set to freeze for the foreseeable future, and next year's profits look likely to fall again,"" he added. ""There are silver linings here and there. For example, EE and the consumer businesses continue to grow. However, these improvements are being more than offset by challenging conditions elsewhere. ""Openreach terms are getting tougher, and the business-to-business and global divisions are having a torrid time. Gavin Patterson will have his work cut out if he's to steady the ship."" BT's share price has halved over the past two years. Investors have become less convinced about the company's ability to make them money, after an accounting scandal, a profits warning and a regulatory fine. BT clearly thinks it has too many staff doing jobs not needed in the digital world. Its wide-ranging corporate shake-up is an attempt to simplify the business, to squeeze more profit out of each pound it spends. It's under pressure to pump more money into fibre optic and super-fast mobile networks and to fill the black hole in its pension scheme. It has made more efforts on those fronts today. Thousands of new hires will be engineers and cyber-experts, focusing not on copper cables, but on building the physical and mobile networks of the future. It's also trying to improve its customer service and mend relations with the regulator. It's a big job, turning a former monopoly into a consumer-focused TV and phone company. Shares are down sharply, suggesting investors are yet to be convinced by BT's plan.

'Iranian forces' fire rockets at Golan,"This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus Israel says it has struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria in its biggest assault since the start of the civil war there. The strikes came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights overnight. Syria's military said the Israeli ""aggression"" had killed three people. There was no immediate comment from Iran, whose deployment of troops to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad has alarmed Israel. Iran has repeatedly called for an end to the existence of the Jewish state. Russia, Germany and France called on both countries to exercise restraint, but the US said Iran bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions"" and that Israel had a right to defend itself. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts there by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, confirmed that rockets were fired towards the occupied Golan. But it said the attack came after Israeli forces bombarded Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone. Israeli forces in the occupied Golan Heights have been on high alert since Tuesday night A senior source in an Iranian-led military alliance that supports Syria's government also told AFP news agency that Israeli forces had fired first. Col Conricus said fighter jets had struck 70 military targets belonging to Iran inside Syria, causing significant damage. The targets included: Intelligence sites associated with Iran and its proxies A logistics headquarters belonging to the Quds Force A military logistics compound in Kiswah, a town south of Damascus An Iranian military compound north of Damascus Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport Intelligence systems and posts associated with the Quds Force Observation and military posts and munitions in the Golan demilitarised zone The IDF said it had also targeted Syrian military air defence systems after they fired at the fighter jets despite an Israeli ""warning"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman later told a conference in the town of Herzliya that the IDF had ""hit almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"". ""They must remember that if it rains here [in Israel], it will pour there,"" he said. ""I hope that we have finished this chapter and that everyone got the message."" Israel's defence minister said it had ""no interest in escalation"" following the strikes However, Syria's military declared it had ""thwarted a new Israeli act of aggression"" and that its air defences ""destroyed a large part"" of the missile barrage. Three people were killed by the missiles, a spokesman said. A radar station and an ammunition depot were also destroyed, and several air defence bases sustained damage, he added. Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained The Syrian Observatory reported that at least 23 people were killed, including five Syrian soldiers and 18 other allied fighters. Russia, which is also supporting the Syrian military, said Israel fired 60 air-to-surface and 10 surface-to-surface missiles and that more than half were shot down. By Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent, BBC News These events have tactical and strategic dimensions. In the short-term the Iranians are seeking ""pay back"" for an Israeli strike against one of their bases in Syria a little over a month ago. On Wednesday night, according to the Israeli military, Iran's Quds Force launched rockets against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. But the scale of the attack was limited - a single multiple-barrel rocket launcher appears to have been used, which the Israelis say they subsequently destroyed. They then apparently hit every Iranian facility they know of in Syria to send a powerful message to Tehran. But neither Israel nor Iran appear to want an all-out war at this stage. Nonetheless their strategic rivalry is clear. Tehran is seeking to establish itself as a military player in Syria to open up another potential front against Israel. And Israel is equally determined to prevent this. Will there be a war between Israel and Iran? Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are determined to stop what they consider Iranian ""military entrenchment"" in the country. Iran has deployed hundreds of troops, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. This video can not be played Tzipi Hotovely: Iran should 'stay away' from Syria Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Mr Netanyahu's lobbying against the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which US President Donald Trump abandoned on Tuesday, has raised tensions further with Tehran. Mr Lieberman stressed that while Israel had ""no interest in escalation"", it had to ""be prepared for any scenario"". ""We are facing a new reality where Iran is attacking Israel directly and trying to harm Israel's sovereignty and territories,"" he added. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

"Malaysia set to have world's oldest leaderAt 92, Mahathir Mohamad makes a shock return after defeating his former protÃ©gÃ© in a dramatic contest.1h44 minutes agoAsia","Dr Mahathir has indicated he may only serve two years Mahathir Mohamad has been sworn in as prime minister of Malaysia after his shock election victory, 15 years after he stood down. After taking the oath at the Istana Negara palace in Kuala Lumpur, he told reporters his focus would be on the country's finances. The former strongman has become, at 92, the world's oldest elected leader. He came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protege Najib Razak. His historic win ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'The biggest mistake in my life' 'There are two types of age' Dr Mahathir took his oath of office before the king, Sultan Muhammad V. The new prime minister was accompanied by his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohammed Ali. This video can not be played Malaysian voters react in 2018 to Mahathir Mohamad's victory over Najib Razak Addressing the media, he pledged that Malaysia would remain a ""friendly trading nation"" and he would work to keep the currency, the ringgit, as ""steady as possible"". He said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in a corruption scandal at 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund set up by Mr Najib. ""We believe that we can get most of the 1MDB money back,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, adding: ""We have to increase the confidence of investors in the administration."" He renewed his promise to seek to have his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, released and pardoned. When Dr Mahathir was previously in power, Anwar was jailed for corruption and sodomy after calling for economic and political reforms. He was released in 2004 but jailed again under Mr Najib in 2015. He is currently due for release next month. Investment analyst Aninda Mitra told Reuters news agency the shock of the election outcome had been as great as ""Brexit and the Trump election"". Official results show Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats. Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption had weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition. ""We feel so united tonight,"" student Abdul Aziz Hamzah, 24, told AFP news agency in the crowd of jubilant supporters  outside the palace. ""Mahathir is so insightful and experienced because he's been here before."" Mahathir supporters waved flags outside the Istana Negara palace Fahmi Fadzil, an MP from the winning coalition, told the BBC Dr Mahathir inspired excitement about Malaysia's future. ""Today he has created, along with other Pakatan Harapan leaders, a resurgence in faith in Malaysia,"" he said. ""The polling centres that I visited, there was a sense of euphoria among people who cast their vote. Members of the press that I had met, some of them said that they cried when they heard that we had won. ""There is very real change happening in Malaysia. Finally we can believe in the country again."" Country profile Oldest winger in town going strong at 95 Remarkable life of Japan's centenarian doctor This video can not be played Marie-Lou Wirth on life at 100 years old. He was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003. Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. However, he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents. Dr Mahathir was also a mentor to Mr Najib, who became prime minister in 2008. Mr Najib (L) was a former protege of Dr Mahathir (C) But Mr Najib was accused of pocketing some $700m (Â£520m) from the 1MDB but vehemently denied the allegations and was cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund, meanwhile, is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib was also accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their posts. Tainted political aristocrat Those allegations led to Dr Mahathir's surprise defection in 2016 from BN to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was ""embarrassed"" to be associated ""with a party that is seen as supporting corruption"". Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again. But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent This morning Malaysia has woken to an entirely new situation, the first transfer of power in its history, albeit to a very familiar leader. But there are huge unknowns. How willingly will BN, the coalition which has, in various forms, run the country since independence and embedded itself into all areas of governance, relinquish power? How well will a disparate coalition, united largely by their desire to oust Najib Razak, work together in government? How smoothly will the plan to gain a pardon for imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and then for Mr Mahathir to hand the premiership to him within two years, actually proceed? And how will they treat Mr Najib, and his high-spending wife, both accused of greed and corruption? After all the jubilation over an impressive act of defiance by Malaysian voters, there is a mountain of challenges to face.

RBS agrees $4.9bn penalty to end US probe,"Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (Â£3.6bn) penalty with US regulators, paving the way for the government to sell down its 70% stake. The long-running probe focused on the sale of financial products including toxic mortgage bonds in 2005-7, ahead of the financial crisis. RBS was bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis. Chief executive Ross McEwan said the settlement will create a ""cleaner bank"" that is easier to sell. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the agreement ""marks another significant milestone in RBS's work to resolve its legacy issues, and will help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares"". Shares in RBSrose 4.3% in morning trading to 287.9p. The settling of the outstanding penalty for RBS' role in the financial crisis was the last obstacle standing in the way of selling the government's enormous 71% stake back to the private sector in what will be the biggest privatisation in UK history. The government owns over Â£20bn worth of shares. That is a colossal amount to sell and will take several years. The first sales will be at a loss, but the government will hope that over time, as the huge overhang of shares to sell dwindles and profits continue to rise, the public may get more money back. The public though are unlikely to ever recoup the Â£45bn poured into the biggest banking debacle in UK corporate history. Read more from Simon here RBS said about $3.6bn of the penalty would be covered by funds already set aside. Many analysts had forecast that the settlement could be larger than $4.9bn. Last July, RBS paid another hefty penalty of $5.5bn to the US Federal Housing Finance Agency. The US Department of Justice said further details must be negotiated with RBS before a final deal is done. But Mr McEwan called the settlement a ""milestone moment"" for the bank. ""Removing the uncertainty over the scale of this settlement means that the investment case for this bank is much clearer,"" he said. Jane Sydenham, from Rathbone Investment Management, told the BBC: ""Removing this final cloud will make a difference, it will mean the government can press ahead with a sale and it can start to look forward, rather than spending all their time worrying about what happened in the past."" RBS is the last in a line of major banks to pay penalties to the DoJ for their activities ahead of the financial crisis. In March,Barclays agreed a $2bn settlementwith US regulators, and Deutsche Bank paid $7.2bn. Rivals also charged by the DoJ include Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.

"Warning of rising food bills after BrexitPeers say it is ""inconceivable"" there will no be impact on supplies, even with a trade deal with EU.5h5 hours agoBusiness","The UK imports roughly half its food - nearly a third of which originates from the EU Food bills could rise sharply if there is no free trade deal with the European Union after Brexit, peers have warned. The Lords EU Environment Committee said it was ""inconceivable"" there would be no impact on EU produce, which makes up 30% of the UK's food imports. While better-off customers could afford to buy more expensive home-grown goods, it said, those on lower incomes could be left with lower-quality imports. Officials said the UK's aim was to ensure the ""smooth flow"" of goods. Brexit-supporting MPs say leaving the EU could reduce food prices by removing unnecessary regulation on UK farmers and cutting tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. But the cross-party committee said it was unclear whether the government's primary goal after Brexit was reducing food prices, or maintaining high animal welfare and food safety standards. Reality Check: The government's customs options The future of farming after Brexit Farm subsidies 'to help environment' In the event of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 without any deal, it said, the UK could face an average 22% tariff on food imports from the Continent. ""While this would not equate to a 22% increase in food prices for consumers, there can be no doubt that prices paid at the checkout would rise,"" it said. ""To counteract this, the government could cut tariffs on all food imports, EU and non-EU, but this would pose a serious risk of undermining UK food producers who could not compete on price."" The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is expected to discuss issues relating to agriculture and food production on Thursday. Half the UK's food is imported, with 30% from the EU, 11% from countries with EU trade deals and the rest from other countries. The committee said there was a ""striking"" contrast between the government's apparent confidence over the risk of disruption to food supplies and the ""vocal"" concerns of industry and consumer bodies. The UK has said it wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU and a customs arrangement that continues to ensure ""frictionless"" trade. Few freight companies are aware of what will happen after Brexit, the industry suggests But the government has not yet said what post-Brexit customs arrangement it wants with the EU, with divisions in the cabinet over whether to seek a close ""customs partnership"" that would not need new border checks or a looser model that would lead to some new checks. The committee warned the UK's ports would be clogged up if EU goods were subject to the same border checks as other imported produce. Yet, it said, allowing produce through with few checks would raise safety concerns. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, said food producers and customs officials must be given time to prepare for any changes and consumers reassured that supplies would continue as normal. After Brexit, British farmers will continue to receive the same level of subsidies they currently get through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. This will continue until 2022. But the committee said it would not be possible to increase food production in time to meet any shortfall caused by Brexit. It said any reductions in EU workers could lead to an increase in recruitment or higher wages for domestic workers but the costs may have to be passed on to customers or some businesses ""may cease to be viable"". The Freight Transport Association said the ""paralysis"" at Dover and on the surrounding road network caused by the French ferry workers' strike in 2015 could be repeated if no customs solutions were found. ""The government understands this... so it must be why they are taking so long to make up their minds,"" said Pauline Bastidon, the organisation's head of European Policy. Most companies had no idea what the impact of Brexit would be on their business, she said. ""It's surprising to see how little advanced companies are in terms of mapping their flows and looking at what their exposure is,"" said Ms Bastidon. ""Only a few are starting to fully realise the impact that Brexit will have on their business."" A government spokeswoman said the cost of food depended on range of factors, including commodity prices,  exchange rates and oil prices, and this would still apply after Brexit. She added: ""But we also want to ensure consumers have access to a wide range of food, which is why we are considering how we best manage border checks and controls when we leave the EU without impacting the smooth flow of trade.""

'New Oxbridge colleges for disadvantaged'Call to expand Oxford and Cambridge universities to boost social mobility.5h5 hours agoFamily & Education,"A new generation of Oxford and Cambridge colleges should be opened to create more places for disadvantaged youngsters, says a report into widening access to university. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) has published ideas from MPs, think tanks and academics to make university more inclusive. The report wants more Oxbridge places, as other universities have expanded. Oxford and Cambridge both said they had ""no plans"" to create new colleges. The report, Reaching the Parts of Society Universities Have Missed, makes recommendations for tackling unequal access to higher education. ""People from rich households are more likely to reach the most prestigious institutions, white working-class boys rarely make it to higher education and there is a big black attainment gap,"" said Hepi director Nick Hillman. Entry to Oxford and Cambridge is described as ""hyper-selective"" and the report suggests a practical response would be to create more places, in the way that many other universities have expanded. A project in Manchester is trying to recruit students whose families have not been to university ""If existing colleges are reluctant to increase their undergraduate entry, then it is time to consider founding a number of entirely new Oxbridge colleges to boost the number of students from under-represented groups at our oldest, richest and most prestigious universities,"" said Mr Hillman. Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) show many leading universities have expanded rapidly in recent years in their undergraduate intake, some by more than 50%. But Cambridge has seen only a much more modest rise in first-year numbers - up by 4%. According to the figures from the higher education data body, Oxford has reduced its first-year intake, down by 21% over the past five years. Oxford challenges the figures used by Hesa, saying the university's own figures suggest full-time undergraduate numbers have remained broadly similar, with a 2% increase. There are calls for university applications to come after students know their exam results But this is far behind a pattern of expansion at many other institutions - the University of Bristol's intake has grown by 22%, University College London by 36%, Queen Mary University of London by 46% and University of Surrey by 57%. A spokeswoman from the University of Oxford said there were ""no plans to expand overall undergraduate numbers or create new colleges"". Oxford's colleges already face ""major challenges"" over accommodation and the university runs many ""initiatives which are expanding the number of students from under-represented backgrounds"", said the spokeswoman. The University of Cambridge also said it did not have any plans to significantly increase undergraduate numbers.

'New Oxbridge colleges for disadvantaged',"A new generation of Oxford and Cambridge colleges should be opened to create more places for disadvantaged youngsters, says a report into widening access to university. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) has published ideas from MPs, think tanks and academics to make university more inclusive. The report wants more Oxbridge places, as other universities have expanded. Oxford and Cambridge both said they had ""no plans"" to create new colleges. The report, Reaching the Parts of Society Universities Have Missed, makes recommendations for tackling unequal access to higher education. ""People from rich households are more likely to reach the most prestigious institutions, white working-class boys rarely make it to higher education and there is a big black attainment gap,"" said Hepi director Nick Hillman. Entry to Oxford and Cambridge is described as ""hyper-selective"" and the report suggests a practical response would be to create more places, in the way that many other universities have expanded. A project in Manchester is trying to recruit students whose families have not been to university ""If existing colleges are reluctant to increase their undergraduate entry, then it is time to consider founding a number of entirely new Oxbridge colleges to boost the number of students from under-represented groups at our oldest, richest and most prestigious universities,"" said Mr Hillman. Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) show many leading universities have expanded rapidly in recent years in their undergraduate intake, some by more than 50%. But Cambridge has seen only a much more modest rise in first-year numbers - up by 4%. According to the figures from the higher education data body, Oxford has reduced its first-year intake, down by 21% over the past five years. Oxford challenges the figures used by Hesa, saying the university's own figures suggest full-time undergraduate numbers have remained broadly similar, with a 2% increase. There are calls for university applications to come after students know their exam results But this is far behind a pattern of expansion at many other institutions - the University of Bristol's intake has grown by 22%, University College London by 36%, Queen Mary University of London by 46% and University of Surrey by 57%. A spokeswoman from the University of Oxford said there were ""no plans to expand overall undergraduate numbers or create new colleges"". Oxford's colleges already face ""major challenges"" over accommodation and the university runs many ""initiatives which are expanding the number of students from under-represented backgrounds"", said the spokeswoman. The University of Cambridge also said it did not have any plans to significantly increase undergraduate numbers. Prof Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education, said: ""Our biggest problem at Cambridge is convincing people they should apply and making it clear to them that they are welcome here.

Malaysia gets world's oldest elected leader,"Dr Mahathir has indicated he may only serve two years Mahathir Mohamad has been sworn in as prime minister of Malaysia after his shock election victory, 15 years after he stood down. After taking the oath at the Istana Negara palace in Kuala Lumpur, he told reporters his focus would be on the country's finances. The former strongman has become, at 92, the world's oldest elected leader. He came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protege Najib Razak. His historic win ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'The biggest mistake in my life' 'There are two types of age' Dr Mahathir took his oath of office before the king, Sultan Muhammad V. The new prime minister was accompanied by his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohammed Ali. This video can not be played Malaysian voters react in 2018 to Mahathir Mohamad's victory over Najib Razak Addressing the media, he pledged that Malaysia would remain a ""friendly trading nation"" and he would work to keep the currency, the ringgit, as ""steady as possible"". He said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in a corruption scandal at 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund set up by Mr Najib. ""We believe that we can get most of the 1MDB money back,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, adding: ""We have to increase the confidence of investors in the administration."" He renewed his promise to seek to have his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, released and pardoned. When Dr Mahathir was previously in power, Anwar was jailed for corruption and sodomy after calling for economic and political reforms. He was released in 2004 but jailed again under Mr Najib in 2015. He is currently due for release next month. Investment analyst Aninda Mitra told Reuters news agency the shock of the election outcome had been as great as ""Brexit and the Trump election"". Official results show Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats. Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption had weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition. ""We feel so united tonight,"" student Abdul Aziz Hamzah, 24, told AFP news agency in the crowd of jubilant supporters  outside the palace. ""Mahathir is so insightful and experienced because he's been here before."" Mahathir supporters waved flags outside the Istana Negara palace Fahmi Fadzil, an MP from the winning coalition, told the BBC Dr Mahathir inspired excitement about Malaysia's future. ""Today he has created, along with other Pakatan Harapan leaders, a resurgence in faith in Malaysia,"" he said. ""The polling centres that I visited, there was a sense of euphoria among people who cast their vote. Members of the press that I had met, some of them said that they cried when they heard that we had won. ""There is very real change happening in Malaysia. Finally we can believe in the country again.""

He was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003. Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. However, he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents. Dr Mahathir was also a mentor to Mr Najib, who became prime minister in 2008. Mr Najib (L) was a former protege of Dr Mahathir (C) But Mr Najib was accused of pocketing some $700m (Â£520m) from the 1MDB but vehemently denied the allegations and was cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund, meanwhile, is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib was also accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their posts. Tainted political aristocrat Those allegations led to Dr Mahathir's surprise defection in 2016 from BN to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was ""embarrassed"" to be associated ""with a party that is seen as supporting corruption"". Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again. But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent This morning Malaysia has woken to an entirely new situation, the first transfer of power in its history, albeit to a very familiar leader. But there are huge unknowns. How willingly will BN, the coalition which has, in various forms, run the country since independence and embedded itself into all areas of governance, relinquish power? How well will a disparate coalition, united largely by their desire to oust Najib Razak, work together in government? How smoothly will the plan to gain a pardon for imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and then for Mr Mahathir to hand the premiership to him within two years, actually proceed? And how will they treat Mr Najib, and his high-spending wife, both accused of greed and corruption? After all the jubilation over an impressive act of defiance by Malaysian voters, there is a mountain of challenges to face.

US trio thank Trump for North Korea release,"This video can not be played President Trump speaks to reporters as he welcomes the detainees US President Donald Trump has welcomed home three American detainees released by North Korea. Mr Trump said it was a ""special night for these really great people"" as they arrived at the Andrews Air Force Base near Washington. The White House said the trio had been freed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the planned meeting between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump said he thought the summit would be ""a big success"". North Korea crisis in 300 words The tricky task of preparing for the summit The date and location have been decided but not yet announced. Mr Trump and his wife Melania entered the plane after it landed at about 02:45 local time (06:45 GMT) and a few minutes later emerged with the three men to wave to the media. The president said he appreciated that Mr Kim had allowed the men to leave as ""frankly we didn't think that was going to happen before the meeting"". Allow Twitter content?

Asked if this was his proudest achievement, he said that would be ""when we denuclearise that entire peninsula"". ""It's a great honour. But the true honour is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons."" Of the upcoming summit, he said: ""I think that we're going to have... a very big success... I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful."" Mr Trump said he hoped he could travel to North Korea one day and that he believed Mr Kim wanted to bring his country ""into the real world"". The three men, Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul, were smiling and waving and appeared in good health. In an impromptu chat before the media with Mr Trump, Kim Dong-chul said: ""It's like a dream and we are very, very happy. We were treated in many different ways. For me, I had to do a lot of labour. But when I got sick I was also treated by them."" The three had released an earlier statement saying: ""We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo and the people of the United States for bringing us home. ""We thank God and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return."" The trio had been jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps. It came during a visit to Pyongyang by Mr Pompeo to arrange details of the meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un. Mike Pompeo, the top US diplomat, has met the North Korean leader twice in under six weeks Mr Kim said he had accepted a US proposal to grant the three detainees an amnesty, adding that his meeting with President Trump would be an ""excellent first step"" towards improving the situation on the Korean peninsula, according to the North Korean state news agency KCNA. The convictions of the trio were widely condemned as political and an abuse of human rights. Left to right: Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim Kim Hak-songwas held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" in May 2017.  He had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) Tony Kim,also known as Kim Sang-duk, also worked at PUST. He was detained in April 2017 on espionage charges. According to South Korean media, he had been involved in humanitarian work in the North Kim Dong-chul, a pastor in his early 60s, was detained in 2015 on spying charges, and was then sentenced to 10 years hard labour Who are North Korea's American detainees? Some 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). People can be jailed by the regime for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect from the country. Political prisoners are often sent to separate prisons - usually brutal labour camps, which involve difficult physical work such as mining and logging. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Warmbier died less than a year after his tearful confession in Pyongyang American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced to hard labour, later said he was forced to work on a farm six days a week despite being in poor health. The last American to be freed -Otto Warmbier, who was jailed for stealing a hotel sign - was released last year but was fatally ill, and died shortly after returning home. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, said they were ""happy for the hostages and their families. We miss Otto"". Speaking at Andrews Air Force Base, Mr Trump said he wanted to pay his ""warmest respects"" to the couple. Mr Trump says the time, date and location will be announced ""within three days"". He said the talks would not be held at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea, one of the suggested venues, and Singapore remains the most likely option.

""We're planning it will be a single day, but in the event that there is more to discuss, there'll be an opportunity for it to extend into the second day as well,"" Mr Pompeo said. The main issue, of course, will be North Korea's nuclear weapons, which Mr Trump has demanded Pyongyang give up. There has been no word from North Korea on its agenda or what it might offer, although a key issue is certain to be the presence of 30,000 US military personnel in South Korea, along with the removal of sanctions. At a summit in April, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-invowed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, although the means of achieving this were not detailed and previous such pledges have been abandoned.

The 92-year-old leader in waiting,"Mahathir had previously served as the country's prime minister from 1981 to 2003 At the age of 97, Mahathir Mohamad is a name that has dominated Malaysian politics for decades. Mr Mahathir first served as the country's prime minister for 22 years, from 1981 to 2003. He is widely credited for Malaysia's rapid economic development and transformation from the 1980s. In 2018, he came out of retirement in a bid to take down former prime minister Najib Razak - who had been accused of embezzling hundreds of millions in state funds. With the help offormer rivalAnwar Ibrahim, Mr Mahathir was voted in again as the country's prime minister, while Mr Najib was charged and eventually jailed on charges of money laundering and abuse of power. But the alliance proved unable to withstand the weight of internal rivalries, and in February 2020 Mr Mahathir found himself ousted in a twist of events that saw the collapse of the governing Pakatan Harapan coalition. However, the two-time premier continues to be an influential figure in the country, although his legacy has been mixed. Mr Mahathir joined political party United Malays National Organisation at the age of 21 and ran a medical practice for seven years in his home state of Kedah before becoming a member of parliament in 1964. In 1969 he lost his seat and was expelled from the party after writing an open letter attacking the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. He later wrote a controversial book entitled The Malay Dilemma. In it, he argued that the country's Malay population had been marginalised, but also castigated them for apathetically accepting a second-class status. It struck a chord with younger UMNO leaders and he was invited back into the party, re-elected to parliament in 1974, and appointed minister of education. Within four years he had become UMNO's deputy leader and, in 1981, he became prime minister. The verdict that sent an untouchable ex-PM to prison A 92-year-old politician's big comeback? Malaysia's youth have power they won't use Politics and Malaysia's multi-racial voters Under his rule, Malaysia transformed into one of the Asian economic tigers of the 1990s - prestige projects such as the Petronas Twin Towers demonstrated the extent of his ambitions. His authoritarian but pragmatic policies won him popular support at home, though this was tempered by his scant regard for human rights. Opposition politicians were jailed without trial under a much-criticised Internal Security Act. Most infamously, his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was sacked, accused of corruption and sodomy and later jailed on the latter charge, when he called for economic and political reforms in 1998. The opposition Pakatan Harapan logo is an eye - a reference to the black eye Anwar Ibrahim received while in custody Frequent barbed comments about the West also earned Mr Mahathir a reputation abroad. Days before he resigned in October 2003, for example, he angered several foreign governments and Jewish groups by claiming a Jewish cabal ""ruled the world"". He said he left his post ""disappointed... because I have achieved too little in my principal task of making my race a successful race, a race that is respected"". Even in retirement, he never really left the political arena. He publicly criticised his successor Abdullah Badawi and, after lacklustre election results for the ruling coalition in 2008, quit the party in what many saw as a way to pressure Mr Abdullah to go. That paved the way for Mr Najib to come to power. Mr Mahathir's initial support for Mr Najib changed, however, as accusations of corruption against him surfaced in regard to a heavily indebted state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

When they got nowhere, however, he, and several high-profile supportersquit UMNO and crossed over to the opposition in 2016. In January 2018,he announced his intention to contest the election, at the age of 92. Mr Mahathir was one of the oldest country leaders in the world On 9 May, he won a historic victory, ousting his former allies after more than 60 years in power. He, together with Mr Anwar and several other parties, formed the Pakatan Harapan coalition, which ruled the country for two years before it collapsed. Malaysia gets new PM after week of turmoil Mr Mahathir threw the country's politics into turmoil in late February 2020 when he resigned, breaking his alliance with Mr Anwar. After his resignation, he and Mr Anwar later announced that they had, in fact, reunited again and commanded majority support. But the king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, who had ultimate say on who should form a government, chose Mr Muhyiddin. A former interior minister, Mr Muhyiddin once controversially described himself as ""Malay first"" and Malaysian second. He, too, did not stay in power long - resigning in August last year after just 17 months in power and yielding his place to current premier Ismail Sabri Yaakob because he had lost majority support in parliament.

Najib Razak: Defeated by his mentor,"Najib denies any wrongdoing regarding 1MDB Najib Razak was long regarded as Malaysian political aristocracy. But in 2018, the then prime minister lost a general election to his former mentor,92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad. The Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957, was voted out of power. Following the defeat, Najib's properties were raided, and both he and his wife were charged with a string of offences. He has sincebeen found guilty on seven charges of corruptionlinked to the multibillion-dollar state investment fund, 1MDB. Najib could face decades in prison. Najib has always denied the allegations and while still in office had been cleared by the country's authorities. But his time in office will likely be remembered as an era plagued with scandal and a strengthening of central power. Najib Razak is the eldest son of Abdul Razak, Malaysia's second prime minister and the nephew of Hussein Onn, its third prime minister. Mahathir Mohamad: Malaysian political survivor After earning an industrial economics degree from the University of Nottingham in the UK, Najib returned to Malaysia in 1974 and worked for the state oil firm Petronas. Najib and his wife have both denied accusations linking them to 1MDB corruption When he moved into politics, Najib held numerous cabinet posts - as minister for energy, telecommunications, education, finance and defence - before becoming deputy prime minister to Abdullah Badawi in 2004. When Mr Abdullah stepped down in 2009, he handed power to Najib. Najib initially promised a more liberal political approach, but did not really follow through. While he reformed tough laws on public gatherings and repealed the controversial Internal Security Act in 2011, he later reinstated detention without trial. The following year, he also went back on a pledge to repeal a controversial sedition law and instead strengthened it. Najib set up the 1MDB state investment fund in 2009 to help develop the economy Critics say the laws were a way for Najib to silence his political opponents and to pander to the ethnic Malay-Muslim majority who formed his political party's largest support base. Opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was convicted of sodomy for a second time in 2015, charges Mr Anwar maintained were politically motivated. The opposition politician has since been pardoned by the new prime minister and is seen as a likely successor to Mr Mahathir. A political drama worthy of Shakespeare Malaysia's $4 sandals vs Birkin bags In 2016, a security act aimed at combating terrorism was used to detain electoral reform activists. Ahead of the 2018 election, Najib's government set up a law against spreading ""fake news"". The real blight of Najib's political career has been accusations of corruption and mismanagement over the state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Ex-PM Najib charged with money laundering Malaysia seizes handbags stuffed with cash 1MDB: Malaysia's global corruption scandal Najib, members of his family and several allies are accused of embezzling huge sums allegedly used to buy everything from artwork to high-end real estate around the globe. Raids on properties linked to Najib uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars In July 2015 he replaced his deputy, who had criticised his handling of the affair, and the attorney-general investigating the case was dismissed for health reasons. In January 2016 the new attorney-general cleared Najib of wrongdoing but the criticism remained. Ahead of the 2018 election, mass demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur called on him to resign. After his defeat,authorities reopened their investigationand charged the former PM with money laundering, breach of trust and abusing his position. On 28 July he was found guilty of money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust. He had pleaded not guilty to all seven charges. Najib said he would appeal and his lawyers are seeking a delay to his sentencing. The former prime minister alsofaces a separate trial that began last Augustand looks at accusations that he illicitly obtained 2.28bn ringgit ($550m, Â£448m) from 1MDB between 2011 and 2014. He faces 21 counts of money-laundering and four of abuse of power. He denies any wrongdoing.

Iranian forces 'fire rockets' at Golan,"This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus Israel says it has struck almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria in its biggest assault since the start of the civil war there. The strikes came after 20 rockets were fired at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights overnight. Syria's military said the Israeli ""aggression"" had killed three people. There was no immediate comment from Iran, whose deployment of troops to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad has alarmed Israel. Iran has repeatedly called for an end to the existence of the Jewish state. Russia, Germany and France called on both countries to exercise restraint, but the US said Iran bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions"" and that Israel had a right to defend itself. The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 50km (30 miles) from the capital Damascus. Israel occupied most of the area in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts there by the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said four rockets were intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome aerial defence system, while 16 others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage were reported. Israel v Iran in 300 words Are Israel and Iran heading for a war? Iran and Israel: Your questions answered The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, confirmed that rockets were fired towards the occupied Golan. But it said the attack came after Israeli forces bombarded Baath, a town in the demilitarised zone. Israeli forces in the occupied Golan Heights have been on high alert since Tuesday night A senior source in an Iranian-led military alliance that supports Syria's government also told AFP news agency that Israeli forces had fired first. Col Conricus said fighter jets had struck 70 military targets belonging to Iran inside Syria, causing significant damage. The targets included: Intelligence sites associated with Iran and its proxies A logistics headquarters belonging to the Quds Force A military logistics compound in Kiswah, a town south of Damascus An Iranian military compound north of Damascus Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport Intelligence systems and posts associated with the Quds Force Observation and military posts and munitions in the Golan demilitarised zone The IDF said it had also targeted Syrian military air defence systems after they fired at the fighter jets despite an Israeli ""warning"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman later told a conference in the town of Herzliya that the IDF had ""hit almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"". ""They must remember that if it rains here [in Israel], it will pour there,"" he said. ""I hope that we have finished this chapter and that everyone got the message."" Israel's defence minister said it had ""no interest in escalation"" following the strikes However, Syria's military declared it had ""thwarted a new Israeli act of aggression"" and that its air defences ""destroyed a large part"" of the missile barrage. Three people were killed by the missiles, a spokesman said. A radar station and an ammunition depot were also destroyed, and several air defence bases sustained damage, he added. Why is there a war in Syria? The Golan Heights explained The Syrian Observatory reported that at least 23 people were killed, including five Syrian soldiers and 18 other allied fighters. Russia, which is also supporting the Syrian military, said Israel fired 60 air-to-surface and 10 surface-to-surface missiles and that more than half were shot down. By Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent, BBC News These events have tactical and strategic dimensions. In the short-term the Iranians are seeking ""pay back"" for an Israeli strike against one of their bases in Syria a little over a month ago. On Wednesday night, according to the Israeli military, Iran's Quds Force launched rockets against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. But the scale of the attack was limited - a single multiple-barrel rocket launcher appears to have been used, which the Israelis say they subsequently destroyed. They then apparently hit every Iranian facility they know of in Syria to send a powerful message to Tehran. But neither Israel nor Iran appear to want an all-out war at this stage. Nonetheless their strategic rivalry is clear. Tehran is seeking to establish itself as a military player in Syria to open up another potential front against Israel. And Israel is equally determined to prevent this. Will there be a war between Israel and Iran? Israel's military had been anticipating an attack by Iranian forces after reportedly carrying out a number of strikes on their facilities in Syria in recent months. They included one on an airbase in April that killed seven Iranian troops. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are determined to stop what they consider Iranian ""military entrenchment"" in the country. Iran has deployed hundreds of troops, ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military. Thousands of militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers. This video can not be played Tzipi Hotovely: Iran should 'stay away' from Syria Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Revolutionary Guards had moved advanced weapons to Syria, including surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten Israeli fighter jets. Mr Netanyahu's lobbying against the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which US President Donald Trump abandoned on Tuesday, has raised tensions further with Tehran. Mr Lieberman stressed that while Israel had ""no interest in escalation"", it had to ""be prepared for any scenario"". ""We are facing a new reality where Iran is attacking Israel directly and trying to harm Israel's sovereignty and territories,"" he added. Are Israel and Iran heading for a war?

North Korea frees US detainees,"Left to right: Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim North Korea has freed three US citizens from prison, according to a tweet from US President Donald Trump. It is viewed as a goodwill gesture ahead of a historic summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump said he would greet the men when they return with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been in Pyongyang to arrange the planned talks. Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul boarded the plane ""without assistance"", the White House said. They had been jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps. Mr Trump announced the release of the men in a tweet on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""They seem to be in good health,"" he wrote, adding that a date and location had been set for talks after Mr Pompeo held a ""good meeting"" with Kim Jong-un. Reporters travelling with Mr Pompeo said their meeting lasted about 90 minutes. In his tweet, Mr Trump added that he would personally greet the detainees,externalwhen they arrive at Andrews Air Force Base at 02:00 EDT (06:00GMT) on Thursday. In later remarks, Mr Trump said that the location for the talks would be announced ""within three days"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies He added that they will not take place in the demilitarised border zone between North and South Korea known as the DMZ. Kim Hak-songwas held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" in May 2017.  He had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) Tony Kim,also known as Kim Sang-duk, also worked at PUST. He was detained in April 2017 on espionage charges. According to South Korean media, he had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. Kim Dong-chul, a pastor in his early 60s, was detained in 2015 on spying charges, and was then sentenced to 10 years hard labour. Who are North Korea's American detainees? One of the detainees was jailed in 2015, the other two have been in prison for just over a year. Their convictions have been widely condemned as political and an abuse of human rights. Ahead of his visit, the second to North Korea in under six weeks, the secretary of state said that he hoped North Korea would ""do the right thing"" and release the detainees. Allow Twitter content?

The fate of the detainees has been a key factor in the build up to the Trump-Kim meeting. South Korea's presidential Blue House welcomed the release of the Americans, saying it would have a ""positive effect"" for upcoming negotiations. Blue House spokesman Yoon Young-chan also called upon the North to release six South Korean prisoners. Mike Pompeo, the top US diplomat, has met the North Korean leader twice in under six weeks ""In order to reinforce reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea and to spread peace on the Korean peninsula, we wish for a swift repatriation of South Korean detainees,"" Mr Yoon said. In a statement provided to the BBC,external, the family of Tony Kim said they ""want to thank all of those who have worked toward and contributed to his return home"". ""We also want to thank the President for engaging directly with North Korea,"" the family said. Can SouthKorea achieve the same? Analysis byLaura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul The US has made progress where South Korea has not. President Moon Jae-in raised the issue of six South Koreans held in the North during his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un at the border. But there is no homecoming for them. A statement from the Presidential palace in Seoul states that they hope they will be returned soon given the ""atmosphere of peace that has begun on the Korean peninsula"". Since the end of the Korean War, 3,835 South Koreans have been taken by the North. Of those, 3,319 were allowed to return or escaped, according to a study by the Asan Institute in Seoul. That means there are 516 people whose fate in North Korea is not known. North Korea maintains many of those from the South remain of their own free will. But their families disagree and call for independent verification. Then there are the divided families. Divided by lines drawn to separate the two Koreas after war or divided because some in the family chose to defect to the South. I met one teenager who hasn't seen her mother since January 2011. She remembers the exact time they said goodbye. The start of the peace process has seen the reunification of three Korean American families. As the negotiations continue, the hope here in South Korea is that there will be many more reunions to come. What are NorthKorean prisons like? Some 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). People can be jailed by the regime for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect from the country. Political prisoners are often sent to separate prisons - usually brutal labour camps, which involve difficult physical work such as mining and logging. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Warmbier died less than a year after his tearful confession in Pyongyang American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced to hard labour, was himself forced to work on a farm six days a week despite being in poor health. Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? The last American to be freed -Otto Warmbier, who was jailed for stealing a hotel sign - was released last year but was fatally ill, and died shortly after returning home. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier. said they were ""happy for the hostages and their families. We miss Otto"".

Profile: Mahathir Mohamad,"Mahathir had previously served as the country's prime minister from 1981 to 2003 At the age of 97, Mahathir Mohamad is a name that has dominated Malaysian politics for decades. Mr Mahathir first served as the country's prime minister for 22 years, from 1981 to 2003. He is widely credited for Malaysia's rapid economic development and transformation from the 1980s. In 2018, he came out of retirement in a bid to take down former prime minister Najib Razak - who had been accused of embezzling hundreds of millions in state funds. With the help offormer rivalAnwar Ibrahim, Mr Mahathir was voted in again as the country's prime minister, while Mr Najib was charged and eventually jailed on charges of money laundering and abuse of power. But the alliance proved unable to withstand the weight of internal rivalries, and in February 2020 Mr Mahathir found himself ousted in a twist of events that saw the collapse of the governing Pakatan Harapan coalition. However, the two-time premier continues to be an influential figure in the country, although his legacy has been mixed. Mr Mahathir joined political party United Malays National Organisation at the age of 21 and ran a medical practice for seven years in his home state of Kedah before becoming a member of parliament in 1964. In 1969 he lost his seat and was expelled from the party after writing an open letter attacking the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. He later wrote a controversial book entitled The Malay Dilemma. In it, he argued that the country's Malay population had been marginalised, but also castigated them for apathetically accepting a second-class status. It struck a chord with younger UMNO leaders and he was invited back into the party, re-elected to parliament in 1974, and appointed minister of education. Within four years he had become UMNO's deputy leader and, in 1981, he became prime minister. The verdict that sent an untouchable ex-PM to prison A 92-year-old politician's big comeback? Malaysia's youth have power they won't use Politics and Malaysia's multi-racial voters Under his rule, Malaysia transformed into one of the Asian economic tigers of the 1990s - prestige projects such as the Petronas Twin Towers demonstrated the extent of his ambitions. His authoritarian but pragmatic policies won him popular support at home, though this was tempered by his scant regard for human rights. Opposition politicians were jailed without trial under a much-criticised Internal Security Act. Most infamously, his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was sacked, accused of corruption and sodomy and later jailed on the latter charge, when he called for economic and political reforms in 1998. The opposition Pakatan Harapan logo is an eye - a reference to the black eye Anwar Ibrahim received while in custody Frequent barbed comments about the West also earned Mr Mahathir a reputation abroad. Days before he resigned in October 2003, for example, he angered several foreign governments and Jewish groups by claiming a Jewish cabal ""ruled the world"". He said he left his post ""disappointed... because I have achieved too little in my principal task of making my race a successful race, a race that is respected"". Even in retirement, he never really left the political arena. He publicly criticised his successor Abdullah Badawi and, after lacklustre election results for the ruling coalition in 2008, quit the party in what many saw as a way to pressure Mr Abdullah to go. That paved the way for Mr Najib to come to power. Mr Mahathir's initial support for Mr Najib changed, however, as accusations of corruption against him surfaced in regard to a heavily indebted state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). US looks to seize $540m in 'stolen' assets from Malaysia fund 1MDB 1MDB: The case that has riveted Malaysia Malaysian artist jailed for mocking Prime Minister Najib Razak He commanded enough loyalty from supporters within UMNO to press the case against Mr Najib from within the party and government. When they got nowhere, however, he, and several high-profile supportersquit UMNO and crossed over to the opposition in 2016. In January 2018,he announced his intention to contest the election, at the age of 92. Mr Mahathir was one of the oldest country leaders in the world On 9 May, he won a historic victory, ousting his former allies after more than 60 years in power. He, together with Mr Anwar and several other parties, formed the Pakatan Harapan coalition, which ruled the country for two years before it collapsed. Malaysia gets new PM after week of turmoil Mr Mahathir threw the country's politics into turmoil in late February 2020 when he resigned, breaking his alliance with Mr Anwar. After his resignation, he and Mr Anwar later announced that they had, in fact, reunited again and commanded majority support. But the king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, who had ultimate say on who should form a government, chose Mr Muhyiddin. A former interior minister, Mr Muhyiddin once controversially described himself as ""Malay first"" and Malaysian second. He, too, did not stay in power long - resigning in August last year after just 17 months in power and yielding his place to current premier Ismail Sabri Yaakob because he had lost majority support in parliament.

Profile: Najib Razak,"Najib denies any wrongdoing regarding 1MDB Najib Razak was long regarded as Malaysian political aristocracy. But in 2018, the then prime minister lost a general election to his former mentor,92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad. The Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957, was voted out of power. Following the defeat, Najib's properties were raided, and both he and his wife were charged with a string of offences. He has sincebeen found guilty on seven charges of corruptionlinked to the multibillion-dollar state investment fund, 1MDB. Najib could face decades in prison. Najib has always denied the allegations and while still in office had been cleared by the country's authorities. But his time in office will likely be remembered as an era plagued with scandal and a strengthening of central power. Najib Razak is the eldest son of Abdul Razak, Malaysia's second prime minister and the nephew of Hussein Onn, its third prime minister. Mahathir Mohamad: Malaysian political survivor After earning an industrial economics degree from the University of Nottingham in the UK, Najib returned to Malaysia in 1974 and worked for the state oil firm Petronas. Najib and his wife have both denied accusations linking them to 1MDB corruption When he moved into politics, Najib held numerous cabinet posts - as minister for energy, telecommunications, education, finance and defence - before becoming deputy prime minister to Abdullah Badawi in 2004. When Mr Abdullah stepped down in 2009, he handed power to Najib. Najib initially promised a more liberal political approach, but did not really follow through. While he reformed tough laws on public gatherings and repealed the controversial Internal Security Act in 2011, he later reinstated detention without trial. The following year, he also went back on a pledge to repeal a controversial sedition law and instead strengthened it. Najib set up the 1MDB state investment fund in 2009 to help develop the economy Critics say the laws were a way for Najib to silence his political opponents and to pander to the ethnic Malay-Muslim majority who formed his political party's largest support base. Opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was convicted of sodomy for a second time in 2015, charges Mr Anwar maintained were politically motivated. The opposition politician has since been pardoned by the new prime minister and is seen as a likely successor to Mr Mahathir. A political drama worthy of Shakespeare Malaysia's $4 sandals vs Birkin bags In 2016, a security act aimed at combating terrorism was used to detain electoral reform activists. Ahead of the 2018 election, Najib's government set up a law against spreading ""fake news"". The real blight of Najib's political career has been accusations of corruption and mismanagement over the state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Ex-PM Najib charged with money laundering Malaysia seizes handbags stuffed with cash 1MDB: Malaysia's global corruption scandal Najib, members of his family and several allies are accused of embezzling huge sums allegedly used to buy everything from artwork to high-end real estate around the globe. Raids on properties linked to Najib uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars In July 2015 he replaced his deputy, who had criticised his handling of the affair, and the attorney-general investigating the case was dismissed for health reasons. In January 2016 the new attorney-general cleared Najib of wrongdoing but the criticism remained. Ahead of the 2018 election, mass demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur called on him to resign. After his defeat,authorities reopened their investigationand charged the former PM with money laundering, breach of trust and abusing his position. On 28 July he was found guilty of money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust. He had pleaded not guilty to all seven charges. Najib said he would appeal and his lawyers are seeking a delay to his sentencing. The former prime minister alsofaces a separate trial that began last Augustand looks at accusations that he illicitly obtained 2.28bn ringgit ($550m, Â£448m) from 1MDB between 2011 and 2014. He faces 21 counts of money-laundering and four of abuse of power. He denies any wrongdoing.

RBS agrees $4.9bn penalty to end US probeThe Royal Bank of Scotland settles with US Justice Department for actions in lead-up to financial crisis.10m11 minutes agoBusiness,"Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (Â£3.6bn) penalty with US regulators, paving the way for the government to sell down its 70% stake. The long-running probe focused on the sale of financial products including toxic mortgage bonds in 2005-7, ahead of the financial crisis. RBS was bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis. Chief executive Ross McEwan said the settlement will create a ""cleaner bank"" that is easier to sell. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the agreement ""marks another significant milestone in RBS's work to resolve its legacy issues, and will help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares"". Shares in RBSrose 4.3% in morning trading to 287.9p. The settling of the outstanding penalty for RBS' role in the financial crisis was the last obstacle standing in the way of selling the government's enormous 71% stake back to the private sector in what will be the biggest privatisation in UK history. The government owns over Â£20bn worth of shares. That is a colossal amount to sell and will take several years. The first sales will be at a loss, but the government will hope that over time, as the huge overhang of shares to sell dwindles and profits continue to rise, the public may get more money back. The public though are unlikely to ever recoup the Â£45bn poured into the biggest banking debacle in UK corporate history. Read more from Simon here RBS said about $3.6bn of the penalty would be covered by funds already set aside. Many analysts had forecast that the settlement could be larger than $4.9bn. Last July, RBS paid another hefty penalty of $5.5bn to the US Federal Housing Finance Agency. The US Department of Justice said further details must be negotiated with RBS before a final deal is done. But Mr McEwan called the settlement a ""milestone moment"" for the bank. ""Removing the uncertainty over the scale of this settlement means that the investment case for this bank is much clearer,"" he said. Jane Sydenham, from Rathbone Investment Management, told the BBC: ""Removing this final cloud will make a difference, it will mean the government can press ahead with a sale and it can start to look forward, rather than spending all their time worrying about what happened in the past."" RBS is the last in a line of major banks to pay penalties to the DoJ for their activities ahead of the financial crisis. In March,Barclays agreed a $2bn settlementwith US regulators, and Deutsche Bank paid $7.2bn. Rivals also charged by the DoJ include Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.

"Warning of rising food bills after BrexitPeers say it is ""inconceivable"" there will no be impact on supplies even with a trade deal with EU.1h34 minutes agoBusiness","The UK imports roughly half its food - nearly a third of which originates from the EU Food bills could rise sharply if there is no free trade deal with the European Union after Brexit, peers have warned. The Lords EU Environment Committee said it was ""inconceivable"" there would be no impact on EU produce, which makes up 30% of the UK's food imports. While better-off customers could afford to buy more expensive home-grown goods, it said, those on lower incomes could be left with lower-quality imports. Officials said the UK's aim was to ensure the ""smooth flow"" of goods. Brexit-supporting MPs say leaving the EU could reduce food prices by removing unnecessary regulation on UK farmers and cutting tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. But the cross-party committee said it was unclear whether the government's primary goal after Brexit was reducing food prices, or maintaining high animal welfare and food safety standards. Reality Check: The government's customs options The future of farming after Brexit Farm subsidies 'to help environment' In the event of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 without any deal, it said, the UK could face an average 22% tariff on food imports from the Continent. ""While this would not equate to a 22% increase in food prices for consumers, there can be no doubt that prices paid at the checkout would rise,"" it said. ""To counteract this, the government could cut tariffs on all food imports, EU and non-EU, but this would pose a serious risk of undermining UK food producers who could not compete on price."" The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee is expected to discuss issues relating to agriculture and food production on Thursday. Half the UK's food is imported, with 30% from the EU, 11% from countries with EU trade deals and the rest from other countries. The committee said there was a ""striking"" contrast between the government's apparent confidence over the risk of disruption to food supplies and the ""vocal"" concerns of industry and consumer bodies. The UK has said it wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU and a customs arrangement that continues to ensure ""frictionless"" trade. Few freight companies are aware of what will happen after Brexit, the industry suggests But the government has not yet said what post-Brexit customs arrangement it wants with the EU, with divisions in the cabinet over whether to seek a close ""customs partnership"" that would not need new border checks or a looser model that would lead to some new checks. The committee warned the UK's ports would be clogged up if EU goods were subject to the same border checks as other imported produce. Yet, it said, allowing produce through with few checks would raise safety concerns. Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee, said food producers and customs officials must be given time to prepare for any changes and consumers reassured that supplies would continue as normal. After Brexit, British farmers will continue to receive the same level of subsidies they currently get through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. This will continue until 2022. But the committee said it would not be possible to increase food production in time to meet any shortfall caused by Brexit. It said any reductions in EU workers could lead to an increase in recruitment or higher wages for domestic workers but the costs may have to be passed on to customers or some businesses ""may cease to be viable"". The Freight Transport Association said the ""paralysis"" at Dover and on the surrounding road network caused by the French ferry workers' strike in 2015 could be repeated if no customs solutions were found. ""The government understands this... so it must be why they are taking so long to make up their minds,"" said Pauline Bastidon, the organisation's head of European Policy. Most companies had no idea what the impact of Brexit would be on their business, she said. ""It's surprising to see how little advanced companies are in terms of mapping their flows and looking at what their exposure is,"" said Ms Bastidon. ""Only a few are starting to fully realise the impact that Brexit will have on their business."" A government spokeswoman said the cost of food depended on range of factors, including commodity prices,  exchange rates and oil prices, and this would still apply after Brexit. She added: ""But we also want to ensure consumers have access to a wide range of food, which is why we are considering how we best manage border checks and controls when we leave the EU without impacting the smooth flow of trade.""

Two guilty over girl's bouncy castle death,"Summer Grant died when the bouncy castle blew away while she was still inside Two fairground workers have been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after a bouncy castle blew away with a young girl still inside. Summer Grant, seven, died in hospital after she was rescued from the inflatable -  which bounced for 300m - in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March 2016. William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby, 26,  failed to ensure the bouncy castle was ""adequately anchored"" to the ground, the court heard. They will be sentenced in June. The three-week trial heard Summer only had ""a few minutes"" left of her turn on the bouncy castle, but Mrs Thurston said she decided to ""let them finish their go"" before taking the inflatable down. Prosecutor Tracy Ayling QC said: ""While Summer was in the bouncy castle, it blew away from its moorings and bounced 300 metres down a hill. Having hit a tree, it came to rest."" She said the Thurstons, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, did notmonitor weather conditionsto ensure it was safe to use on the day. Shelby and William Thurston have been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence Mr Thurston said he was aware that Storm Katie was due to arrive two days later, but believed it was ""not hugely significant"". Chelmsford Crown Court had heard the bouncy castle - called Circus Superdome - had lifted ""suddenly"" while Summer was inside. Mr Thurston said he felt  ""a sense of disbelief"" and ""froze for a second"" before giving chase. He told the court how he unzipped an emergency exit on the inflatable, carried Summer out and placed her in the recovery position, describing it as ""the worst thing I'd ever seen"". Summer suffered ""multiple traumatic injuries to the head, neck and chest"" and died later in hospital. Cordons were set up at the fairground at Harlow Town Park after the incident Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said the Thurstons had acted ""disgracefully"" putting up a bouncy castle in 36mph winds. ""The Thurstons held a huge responsibility to ensure the safety of the children that used their rides. ""They treated this responsibility with total disregard, putting profit before safety,"" he said. ""Summer Grant was a beautiful little girl with a beaming smile and a caring nature. Her parents Cara and Lee, her sister Lily and her wider family have suffered an unspeakable loss."" David Kerr-Sheppard, the Essex Air Ambulance pilot who attended the scene, told the trialconditions were squallywith ""sudden, sometimes violent bursts of wind that could easily change direction"". He said the weather was not suitable to fly Summer to a London hospital and she was instead taken by road to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow. Jenny Hopkins, of the East of England Crown Prosecution Service, said after the verdicts: ""This should have been a happy, family day out at a funfair. ""It resulted in Summer's death. I hope that these convictions today will be of a small comfort to Summer's family."" The couple were also found guilty of a health and safety offence.  They were convicted by majority verdicts of ten to two after 11 hours of deliberations by the jury. Judge Mr Justice Garnham, who delayed sentencing for four weeks, said he would be ""seriously considering imprisonment"".

Birthmark baby dubbed 'little superhero',"Medical experts have told Natalie's parents that the birthmark is not causing any damage to her vision A baby girl has been dubbed a ""little superhero"" due to the Batman mask-like birthmark covering a third of her face. Four-month-old Natalie Jackson was born with the black birthmark which is expected to grow as she gets older. Parents Lacey and Andrew said instead of getting it removed they would encourage Natalie to be proud of it. Her mum said: ""People tell us how amazing her birthmark is and how gorgeous she is and we couldn't agree more."" Mrs Jackson and her husband Andrew, who is originally from Hull, said they were  initially ""filled with panic"" when they first saw the distinctive mark across her daughter's face. The superhero nickname came about after baby Natalie met her brothers for the first time Natalie was born on 9 January at Sanford USD Medical Centre in South Dakota in the US, where the family now live. ""She was so beautiful but it looked like a bruise and I was worried in case it was something I had done to her during my pregnancy,"" said Mrs Jackson. ""Medics said it was just a birthmark though, and she was breathing and healthy."" Her superhero nickname came after her brothers Elliot, seven and Devin, four, met their sister for the first time. Mrs Jackson said: ""One of the boys asked, 'What's that on her face mum? What's that black mark?' ""I told him it was her superhero mask. I told them that, because of it, she could achieve anything."" Although her parents worry the birthmark may attract cruel comments, they are determined their daughter will embrace her uniqueness. ""We'll always tell her it's a part of who she is and who she is supposed to be,"" Mrs Jackson said. ""We know she will come up against some difficulties, but her mark means she is going to be stronger no matter what life throws at her.""

"Cinema drinks contain 'unsafe' bacteriaA BBC Watchdog investigation tested hygiene standards at Odeon, Vue and Cineworld chains.6h6 hours agoHealth","Drinks from three of the UK's largest cinema chains have been found to contain unacceptably high levels of bacteria, a BBC investigation has found. Fizzy drinks from Cineworld, Odeon and Vue were tested in 30 cinemas, for BBC One's Watchdog programme. Seven branches sold drinks with unacceptable bacteria levels. Environmental health expert Tony Lewis said he was ""concerned"" it was ""an indicator of hygiene failure"". Traces of the bacteriasalmonella,external, which can cause food poisoning, were reportedly discovered in two drinks from branches of Odeon cinemas. Listeria had also been found, in a drinks holder, Watchdog said. The investigation tested drinks at 10 branches of each company. It also looked for bacteria on the seat fabric, on the cup holder and in ice cubes. The results were sent to London Metropolitan University's ""superlab"" to be tested. According to Watchdog, out of the seven cinemas with drinks with high bacteria levels: Four belonged to Cineworld, where one drink had 70 times the level considered acceptable Vue had one of the high bacteria drinks, and this was 100 times the acceptable level Odeon had two high bacteria drinks and one had 10,000 times the acceptable level Mr Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: ""That's the highest I've seen. And that is an indicator of equipment not being kept clean. That's a worry."" Salmonella bacteria can cause vomiting, stomach cramps and fever He said high bacteria levels in fizzy drinks were particularly concerning because they were ingested immediately. Ice containing bacteria levels above an acceptable level - more than 1,000 units of bacteria per one millilitre of liquid - were found in nine cinemas, Watchdog said. Four of those ice samples were from Cineworld branches, two were from Vue, and three from Odeon. The highest bacteria count in ice was 10 million bacteria in one millilitre of liquid, and was found in the same Odeon branch as the highest bacteria-filled drink. Mr Lewis said: ""Ultimately, it's about people cutting corners And it's also about managers, owners of cinemas, managers of cinemas, not taking their responsibilities seriously and potentially keeping on top of the issues."" Watchdog reported mixed results on bacteria on the seats and in drinks holders. Since those bacteria are unlikely to reach your mouth, they are thought to be less of a concern. The cinema chains have all told the programme they take hygiene ""incredibly seriously"" and have robust cleaning procedures in place. Odeon and Cineworld said seats, drinks holders and drink dispensers were thoroughly cleaned daily, with the ice machines emptied and fully cleaned weekly. Odeon said it was therefore ""surprised and disappointed at the Watchdog findings"" and had immediately launched its own investigation, adding  it had ""taken immediate steps"" and ""further strengthened procedures"" across the UK. Cineworld said the branches tested ""have all been awarded the maximum food hygiene rating of five by their local authority"" and its cleaning procedures were compulsory for all branches. Vue rejected the findings, saying it ""follows strict hygiene procedures daily"". It also said it undertook its own independent tests regularly, ""conducted by a qualified clinical microbiologist with nationally recognised accredited training"", and worked with ""third-party water experts, exceeding the requirements for water testing"".

Digital revolution signals faster trainsNetwork Rail says a five-year scheme to replace ageing signalling marks a turning point for the UK.,"Faster, more frequent trains are being promised by Network Rail as it embarks on a digital overhaul to cope with rising passenger numbers, ageing equipment and the construction of HS2. The aim is for 70% of journeys to benefit from digital technology by the time HS2 reaches Manchester in 2033. Routes into various London mainline stations and across the Pennines will be the first to benefit. Network Rail described it as ""a turning point in the history of our railways"". More than half the UK's analogue signalling systems will need to be replaced in the next 15 years. That would cost about Â£20bn but deliver very little benefit to passengers, said Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne. ""New digital signalling offers a more cost-effective alternative that also brings significant benefit for rail users, such as more capacity, speed and reliability,"" he said. ""Not since the railway transformed from steam to diesel in the 1960s has a technological breakthrough held such promise to vastly improve our railway."" Trains could soon run 24 hours a day across network - rail boss Network Rail to end station toilet charges in 2019 Weather impact 'priority' for Network Rail Digital train control is already a reality on Crossrail and on Thameslink services through London Bridge, which uses ""fly-by-wire"" automatically operated trains. In the five years to 2024 the industry is planning to introduce it across the Pennines, the southern end of the East Coast main line into King's Cross and on some major commuter routes into Waterloo. The digital technology will safely allow more services to operate every hour by running trains closer together, improving frequency and capacity and reducing signal failures. Track is currently divided into long sections separated by traffic lights, but these will become shorter and the signalling system will be visible in the train's cab. There are 20,000 miles of track and 30,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts on the British network It runs 19 of Britain's largest stations, while the remaining 2,500-plus are run by the train operating companies More than 4.6 million journeys are made every day in Great Britain, which is 1.7 billion in a year - double the amount taken 20 years ago The programme will be launched at an event in York on Thursday to be attended by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He said: ""We're not going to transform a Victorian system overnight - there's been not enough done for many, many years. ""Passenger numbers have doubled, the railways are bursting at the seams. We're now spending Â£20bn over the next five years to try and create a more reliable network.""
