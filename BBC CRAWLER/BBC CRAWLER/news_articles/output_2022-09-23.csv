Liverpool fans to sue Uefa over final chaosLawyers say Uefa failed to provide a safe environment for fans at the Champions League final in Paris.Liverpool,"Liverpool fans were left stuck outside the ground and the match was delayed by 35 minutes More than 1,700 Liverpool fans who claim they were injured or left with psychological trauma at the chaotic Champions League Final are to sue Uefa, lawyers have said. European football's governing body is facing group actions over the final against Real Madrid in Paris. Uefa delayed kick-off by 35 minutes, citing ""security issues"". Liverpool law firm Bingham's said clients had spoken of ""terrifying scenes"" at the Stade de France. Bingham's has teamed up with global law company Pogust Goodhead in a lawsuit for 1,450 clients alleging negligence. Lawyers said they would sue Uefa for breach of contract in ticket sales and negligence over a duty of care they had towards supporters, who were harmed physically and psychologically.Â Many Reds supporters spoke oflong queues in the hours leading up to the gameand a heavy-handed police response to the build-up of fans. Fans were tear-gassed by police and attacked and robbed by locals. Gerard Long from Binghams said: ""As a life-long Liverpool fan, I was absolutely horrified when I heard how events unfolded at what should have been the highlight of the football season. ""Not only fellow fans, but my friends, family and clients who were in attendance that day have spoken of the terrifying scenes that surrounded the Stade de France before, and even after, the game."" Another law firm, Leigh Day, is also bringing actions. It said it believed Uefa ""failed to provide a safe and secure environment"" for fans. Consumer and travel law experts Clare Campbell and Jill Paterson, who are leading Leigh Day's action, said: ""It was truly shocking to see how Liverpool fans and others who had travelled to watch the Champions League final were treated both at the match and in the aftermath. ""The accounts of their experiences paint a picture of a terrifying situation where people really feared for their lives."" Leigh Day, which has offices in Liverpool, is representing 400 clients. Liverpool FC has gathered 8,500 testimonies from supporters on their experiences that day to submit toan independent review, commissioned by Uefa. Club chief executive Billy Hogan said they ""suffered harrowing experiences"". Uefapreviously apologised to Liverpool and Real Madrid fanscaught up in the events around the final and said it must not happen again. A Uefa representative said the independent review report into what happened would be published in November and the organisation would not make any comment on the topic until then.

Truss faces questions over football club payments,"Liz Truss was Foreign Secretary - pictured here announcing sanctions on Russia in March - when both payments were made Liz Truss is facing questions over Foreign Office spending, including Â£1,841 at Norwich City's online shop during her time as foreign secretary. Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberryqueried the use of Foreign Office expense cards,external, up 45% on last year, in a letter to the department. She asked why officials had incurred a number of costs, including two payments to the then Premier League club. The Foreign Office has been approached for comment. The payments were made on two dates: Â£1,318 on 21 October and Â£523.50 on 21 March. At the time, South West Norfolk MP Liz Truss was leading the department as foreign secretary. She has previously tweeted about Norwich City, including in 2018, when she was Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US to ease internet curbs for Iranians amid unrest,"Widespread protests have been sparked by the death of a woman in policy custody. The US says it will ease internet curbs on Iran to counter Tehran's clampdown on protests which were sparked by a woman's death in police custody. ""We are going to help make sure the Iranian people are not kept isolated and in the dark,"" said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. The relaxation of software controls will allow American tech firms to expand their business in Iran. At least 35 people have been killed in the worst unrest in Iran for years. Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma last week, hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered ""sudden heart failure"". Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. Mr Blinken saidthe partial relaxation of internet restrictions,externalwas a ""concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected"". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was ""afraid of its own people"". What's going on with Iran and the internet? The US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to ""surveil and censor"" its people. But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it ""does not remove every tool of communications repression"". Billionaire Elon Musksaid on Twitter,externalthat he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement. Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet. US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury. Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to. On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard.

Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be ""threatened"". ""We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,"" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Stressing that Iran's ""enemies"" wanted to exploit the unrest, Mr Raisi said the government would listen to criticism over Ms Amini's death, but would not be influenced by ""rioting"".

Donors spending millions on Trump's legal battles,"As Donald Trump's legal woes mount, donors and the Republican party have paid millions in dollars of his legal fees. His newest legal headache saw him and three of his children hit with a fraud lawsuit, which alleges they lied about the value of property ""by billions"". Financial data shows that he has already spent more than $1m (Â£890,000) of donations fighting the case in 2022. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The latest lawsuit, announced by New York state Attorney General Letitia James, was the culmination of a long-running civil investigation which began in 2019. Millions of dollars spent combatting these charges have come from Mr Trump's Save America political action committee (PAC) - which takes donations from Trump supporters across the country - Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show. Save America has paid more than $1.12m this year alone to law firms hired to defend Mr Trump in the New York case. As a so-called ""Leadership PAC"", it can use money to pay for expenses that cannot be funded by campaign committees, such as some personal travel or some leadership expenses. The website of Save America's Joint Fundraising Committee - which contributes both to Save America and a second Trump PAC, Make America Great Again - makes no mention of legal bills, saying only that ""the future of our Country [sic] is at stake and President Trump is calling on all Patriots to join his fight to Save America"". Of the $1.12m spent, more than $942,000 has gone to the firm of Alina Habba, a New Jersey-based attorney who has doubled as a Trump spokeswoman. Another lawyer, New York-based Alan Futerfas, received nearly $185,000 in July. Mr Futerfas is representing Mr Trump's children - Don Jr, Ivanka, and Eric - in the New York fraud case. It is unclear how much of his own money Mr Trump has spent on his legal cases. One donor told the BBC the idea of funding the lawsuits didn't bother him at all. ""In my opinion, he can do whatever he wants with the money,"" said Rom Solene, a Republican from Arizona. ""The non-stop nonsense and antics being conducted by the Democrats on a man who no longer holds political office shows the extent to which the Democrats are willing to go to persecute a political opponent. Not to mention, it shows how much the Democrats and other Washington insiders fear Mr Trump."" The fraud investigation is just one of several expensive legal challenges facing the former president, however. A criminal investigation into possible property crimes, which is linked to the civil fraud case in New York. The state attorney general referred evidence to federal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service. The Manhattan District Attorney's office is also investigating. Allegations Mr Trump mishandled classified documents, which saw FBI agents search his Mar-a-Lago property on 8 August. He is also being investigated for obstruction of justice. The chief prosecutor of Georgia's Fulton County is investigating potential state election crimes related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Part of this revolves around a phone call, in which the former president told a top state election official to ""find 11,780 votes"". A congressional committee has accused Mr Trump of inciting ""an insurrection"" when his supporters ransacked the Capitol on 6 January 2021. There have been no charges arising from this investigation, which is ongoing. Various lawsuits by police officers who have accused Mr Trump of inciting the 6 January attack in which they suffered injuries. In August alone, Mr Trump spent more than $3.8m on legal fees in the wake of the FBI's search of his Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago, the bulk of which - about $3m - went to a nearby Florida firm. Smaller amounts went to lawyers involved in his other legal issues, including a Georgia investigation into whether he and his allies tried to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. But there is no indication the former president's method of settling his legal bills violates any statute. Erin Chlopak, a campaign finance expert at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington DC-based non-profit, told the BBC that legal expenses often fall into a ""grey area"", where it is left up to the Electoral Commission to decide if the expense is ""personal"" or whether it would exist ""irrespective of a person's status as a candidate or officeholder, in which case the money can be used"". ""That's a real problem in campaign finance law,"" Ms Chlopak said. ""We've seen that not just in the context of legal expenses, but in even more blatant personal uses, like personal travel, dining out at expensive restaurants and staying in hotels."" In Mr Trump's case, Ms Chlopak added, the subject is complicated by the array of legal issues he is currently facing. This video can not be played New York attorney general Letitia James wants the Trumps to repay $250m that she says was illegally obtained ""The results of applying the same standard would likely be different in circumstances related to business dealing that has nothing to do with one's status as a former president, as opposed to actions that someone took based on their status as an officeholder."" In the past, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has also helped pay for some of Mr Trump's legal bills, including some related to the New York attorney general's investigation. In late August, however,Politico reported,externalthat the RNC would not pay legal fees related to the Mar-a-Lago search - and that it would completely stop paying legal fees if Mr Trump were to formally announce his intention to run for president in 2024. Ms Chlopak noted that the RNC is free to use funds as it sees fit. While he has hinted at the prospect, Mr Trump is yet to announce that he'll run for the White House again in 2024.

Pound sinks as investors question huge tax cuts,"The pound has fallen to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as financial markets reacted to the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years. UK stocks also dropped after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a series of tax cuts and economic measures in a massive shake-up of the country's finances. The pound fell more than 3% against the dollar, dropping below $1.09. Sterling has fallen recently over worries about the economy and partly due to a stronger US dollar. The pound also fell more than 1% against the euro on Friday, dropping to â¬1.12. Mr Kwarteng refused to comment on the dropping value of the currency, saying he ""doesn't comment on market movements"". What the mini-budget means for you Why has the value of the pound tumbled? UK may already be in recession - Bank of England The cost of government borrowing soared following the announcement, rising by near-record amounts, as investors did the sums over the new strategy. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect UK interest rates to hit 5.2% in August 2023, with expectations rising that there could be a one percentage point interest rate hike at the Bank of England's next meeting in November. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economic think tank, said the market reaction was ""worrying"" as the government's new strategy relied on investors being willing to lend more to the UK. ""The plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. Mr Johnson said the new strategy would inject demand into a high inflation economy, risking further price rises. At the same time the Bank of England was pulling in the opposite direction, and was likely to raise interest rates even further in response to the Â£45bn tax reduction. The Bank of England needs to make an emergency, unscheduled rate hike as soon as next week ""to regain credibility with the market"", said Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos. He said that move would also send a strong signal that the bank is ""willing to do 'whatever it takes' to bring inflation down quickly"". Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers warned the pound could fall below the dollar due to the huge spending commitments outlined by Mr Kwarteng. ""It makes me very sorry to say, but I think the UK is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market,"" Mr Summers told Bloomberg. ""Between Brexit, how far the Bank of England got behind the curve and now these fiscal policies, I think Britain will be remembered for having pursuing the worst macroeconomic policies of any major country in a long time."" Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said the sell-off of sterling showed investors have doubts about the government's plans. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded. That will result in a large amount of debt at a time when the Bank of England is going to be selling some of its holdings of UK government debt,"" she said. ""I think this government does need to provide a lot more reassurance that it does have fiscal sensibility in order. This is not the message that's come across this morning."" The UK's FTSE 100 index of major shares fell more than 2%, dropping to its lowest level for more than two months, reflecting concerns that the plan to stimulate growth might not pay off. The plan also contributed to a sell-off in US markets, where the three main share indexes fell more than 2%. ""Ultimately, the growth dice have been rolled. But it is too early to know if the gamble will succeed and boost confidence enough to encourage businesses and people to spend and invest, stimulating the UK economy,"" said Karen Campbell-Williams, head of tax at Grant Thornton. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK said there was likely to be a boost to the economy of ""roughly 1%"" over the next year, reducing the risk of a longer recession, but that the longer term outlook was less positive. ""There was nothing in the budget that makes us more optimistic about the long-term growth trend of the economy. Trend growth is currently probably half of the 2.5% the Chancellor has set as his new target,"" he said. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK Government bonds in decades, with some of biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, but it sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here.

What does the mini-budget mean for Wales?,"Kwasi Kwarteng promised 'a new approach for a new era' Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has delivered a mini-budget full of tax cuts in a bid to grow the economy. His announcement included tighter rules on universal credit, cancelling a rise on alcohol duty and scrapping the highest rate of income tax. The UK government said more than a million people in Wales will benefit from an earlier than planned reduction in the basic rate of income tax. ""We promised a new approach for a new era,"" Mr Kwarteng said. Mr Kwarteng pledged to ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". But the Labour First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said the announcement ""embeds unfairness,"" giving ""tax cuts to the rich"" and ""bonuses to bankers"" instead of ""meaningful support to those who need it"". One Welsh charity called cuts for the rich while the poorest struggle ""grotesque"", while a Tory MP described the budget as ""great news for stockbrokers"" and ""underwhelming"". Measures included reductions to stamp duty in England. The UK government said the Welsh government would get an additional Â£70m as a result. Kwarteng: Major tax cuts herald 'new era' for UK At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Income tax to be cut by 1p from April Kwarteng admits Tory economic failure, says Labour The chancellor announced that the basic rate of income tax will be cut to 19% from April, one year earlier than planned. Some 1,290,000 people in Wales are on the basic rate of tax. The UK government said the measure would be worth an average of Â£170 per year. Also from April the additional rate of tax, paid at 45% on incomes of over Â£150,000, will be scrapped. Some 9,000 people pay that in Wales. Welsh ministers can vary rates in Wales, but have never done so. Welsh government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans confirmed the UK government decision to scrap the additional rate means Welsh ministers cannot set their own for Wales. Universal credit claimants working fewer than 15 hours a week face having benefits reduced if they do not meet a work coach regularly, and take ""active steps"" to increase their earnings. In January 2022 a total of 232,739 households were on universal credit in Wales. Citizens Advice Cymru said 44,321 people are in the group who would be affected by the new sanction. Jobseekers over the age of 50 will be given more time with jobcentre work coaches to help them return to the job market, the UK government said. The Boris Johnson-era rise in National Insurance, where workers and employers pay an extra 1.25p in the pound, will be reversed from 9 November. Kwasi Kwarteng said planned increases in NHS and social care funding in England will continue. UK government figures suggested the decision will mean two million people in Wales get a National Insurance cut worth Â£235 a year. In England and Northern Ireland stamp duty will be cut, so nothing will be paid on house purchases up to Â£250,000, rising from Â£125,000. First-time buyers will pay no stamp duty on purchases up to Â£425,000. Wales has its own equivalent system, called land transaction tax, where the residential threshold is Â£180,000. There is no first-time buyer rate. The UK government said Welsh ministers will get Â£70m following the changes in England and Northern Ireland. It would be up to the Welsh Labour government if it wants to follow the changes - the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd called for ministers to also make cuts. ""Labour ministers need to take the same approach by scrapping land transaction tax for first time buyers here in Wales and properties up to Â£250,000,"" Tory Shadow Minister for Finance Peter Fox said. Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake said the Welsh government should avoid a universal cut to Land Transaction Tax, ""because as we've seen in the past, it just serves to fuel house prices"". But he said he would like to see ways to ""perhaps support first-time buyers"". A planned rise to corporation tax on companies has been scrapped. Plans to increase alcohol duty on beer, cider, wine and spirits have been cancelled. The chancellor said he would ""look to work"" with the Welsh and Scottish governments on setting up ""investment zones"". Announced for England, the UK government said the zones will offer ""targeted and time limited tax cuts for business and liberalised planning rules to release more land for housing and commercial development"". Planning policy in Wales is controlled by the Welsh government in Cardiff. UK government Welsh Secretary Sir Robert Buckland said: ""Today's bold measures put economic growth at the heart of our plans for Wales and the UK. ""The UK government has already committed to protect Welsh households and businesses from rising prices through the Energy Bill Relief Scheme. But a healthy, growing economy is the best long-term solution to the enormous financial pressures facing the entire country."" But there was concern from the Welsh government, whose Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said it was ""deeply worrying"", with ""misplaced priorities leading to a regressive statement that will embed unfairness across the United Kingdom"". ""Instead of delivering meaningful, targeted support to those who need help the most, the chancellor is prioritising funding for tax cuts for the rich, unlimited bonuses for bankers, and protecting the profits of big energy companies."" A Welsh Conservative MP told BBC Wales that the mini-budget was ""pretty underwhelming"".""Great news for stockbrokers, but not necessarily great news for working families,"" they said.The MP added that the UK government is ""going to need a broader message in the months ahead"" and it must not ""lose sight of the levelling up agenda"".Luke Young of Citizens Advice Cymru, which gives advice to people on benefits, said: ""We need to be plain here: a tax cut for the richest while the least well off struggle to make ends meet is grotesque"". ""Energy prices are locked in higher than they ever have been. Emergency food and fuel needs are at record levels. ""The people we support have little, and today, gain little."" Plaid Cymru Treasury spokesperson Ben Lake said: ""The chancellor's statement today was about supporting those on the highest incomes. ""Households and businesses across Wales are facing a grim winter of unaffordable bills and soaring inflation, and the government's response is to engage in fantasy, trickle-down economics to please the super-rich.""

LiveLiveFederer's farewell: Swiss legend plays doubles with Nadal in Laver Cup22 minutes ago,"Laver Cup: Roger Federer's final competitive match at London's O2 Arena Federer and Rafael Nadal beaten 4-6 7-6 11-9 by Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe in doubles match 'I'm happy, not sad' says Federer in emotional on-court interview Great rival Nadal also in tears sat next to Federer at end of match Swiss legend, 41, won 20 Grand Slam titles but had not played since Wimbledon 2021 because of knee injury Andy Murray beaten 5-7 6-3 10-7 by Alex de Minaur in opening match of evening session Team Europe 2-2 Team World after first day of Ryder Cup-style tournament Matt Gault Sport often fails to deliver the fairytale ending we all want to see. Tonight was a reminder of that. Roger Federer, who for the last two decades has been synonymous sporting excellence, brought the curtain down on his 24-year career with a doubles defeat alongside long-time adversary Rafael Nadal as the Team Europe duo fell to Team World's Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock. But let's not kid ourselves: the result is largely irrelevant. If tonight was about celebrating one of the all-time greats (or, for many, the GOAT), then it has to be viewed as a resounding success. Federer said so himself. ""It does feel like a celebration to me. I wanted to feel like this at the end and it is exactly what I hoped for so thank you. It has been a perfect journey and I would do it all over again."" We'd love to do it all over again, too, but at least we'll always have the memories. Thanks for following the live text tonight. If you're not caught up, Jonathan Jurejko was at the O2 Arena towatch Federer's final act unfold. Goodnight. Federer/Nadal v Sock/Tiafoe People inside the world of tennis have been heaping praise on Roger Federer for 20 years now. Now seems a good time to share some great quotes about him: ""If you want to be a tennis player, then mould yourself on Roger Federer. I won three Wimbledon titles and I wish I could play like him"" -John McEnroe ""The best way to beat him would be to hit him over the head with a racket"" -Rod Laver ""In the modern game, you're a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist or a hard court specialist...or you're Roger Federer"" -Jimmy Connors ""He's a real person. He's not an enigma. Off the court he's not trying to be somebody. If you met him at McDonald's and you didn't know who he was, you would have no idea that he's one of the best athletes in the world"" -Andy Roddick ""Roger can produce tennis shots that should be declared illegal"" -Tracy Austin ""If he's playing very good, I have to play unbelievable. If not, it's impossible. When he's 100%, he's playing in another league. It's impossible to stop him"" -Rafael Nadal ""I don't think you can always, or you can ever, get your game to perfection. Only if you are Federer"" -Novak Djokovic #bbctennis Matthew Vernon:Who else could reduce their greatest rival to tears the way Roger has Rafa. Such respect and love between the two of them, proof rivalry doesn't have to be toxic, it can lead to excellence. We will miss them both so much and have been so lucky to witness their battles. Abid:What a legend. Even Rafa is crying!

Tennis won't be the same. There's Rod Laver, offering Federer a big handshake and some sage words of advice. And now it's time for hugs from the kids. ""I'm happy, I'm not sad."" Mum and dad come over for a hug, too, with Ellie Goulding belting out 'Burn' in the background. Mirka has come down from the crowd and gives her husband a big hug. A special moment for them. Damn. Federer, on the support of his family:""Everyone's here, the boys and girls. My wife has been so supportive. She could have stopped me a long, long time ago but she didn't. She kept me going and allowed me to play, so it's amazing - thank you. ""It's funny, we always blame my mum for everything because without her I wouldn't be here of course. Thanks to my parents, they've been amazing. ""Just everybody, there are too many people to thank. It's been incredible."" And now, Ellie Goulding is going to sing a song. More Federer quotes to come... Barely a dry eye in the house, folks. Nadal wells up as he claps his great friend and rival. Asked about his family, Federer says, ""do we have to go there?"" as he tries to keep it together. Roger Federer, on the last day of his tennis career:""We'll get through this somehow. It's been a wonderful day. I told the guys I'm happy, not sad. It feels great to be here. I enjoyed tying my shoelaces one more, every thing was the last time. ""I didn't feel the stress so much even though I thought maybe something was going to go, like a calf, but the match was great. ""Playing with Rafa and having all the greats here, all the legends, thank you."" Federer wipes away a few tears as he watches a video recapping his career on the big screen. We're going to hear from the man himself soon. But first, a tear-jerker of a video to watch. #bbctennis Andrew Priestley:Farewell to not only a tennis great, but a sporting icon. Many will have their own opinions, but in mine, he is the greatest. The catalyst for the greatest era in tennis history, Roger Federer will be sorely missed on the courts of the world. The end of an era. The end of an incredible career. Federer returns to the court and salutes the crowd. It's not the ending he wanted, but what a send-off this is. The atmosphere out there has been electric. Federer goes across and embraces his team-mates. He's in tears now. He's not the only one choking up right now... Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-11 Sock/Tiafoe It's all over. Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe beat Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, bringing the curtain down on Federer's career. Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-10 Sock/Tiafoe* Frances Tiafoe hammers a forehand past Rafa Nadal and it's match point for Team World... Â© 2025 BBC.

Hot tub row councillor guilty of careless drivingTom Hollis's careless driving trial followed his harassment conviction over a hot tub dispute.Nottingham,"Tom Hollis was told he will be sentenced on 13 October A councillor drove at high speed through a 30mph zone before reversing into a police car, a court heard. Tom Hollis, deputy leader of Ashfield District Council in Nottinghamshire, was spotted by officers while on his way home from bingo in September 2020. On Friday he was found guilty of driving without care and attention. The verdict comes a day after Holliswas convicted of harassing neighbourswho had accused him of holding hot tub meetings during a Covid lockdown. Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard Hollis had been returning home from bingo in a Range Rover when two police officers in an unmarked vehicle spotted the defendant travelling at high speed along Outram Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield. The officers made up ground to follow the defendant, with the court hearing the officers were driving at 70mph. Turning their blue lights on, police continued to follow Hollis at speed along Northern Bridge Road to an Asda petrol station forecourt in Priestsic Road. James Gregory, who was filling up his car on the forecourt, said the Range Rover ""swung"" onto the forecourt and he ""had to take a step back"" as he thought he would be hit. He told the court the manner of Hollis's driving left him ""shocked and frightened"". ""It didn't appear to slow down â¦ it looked like a full-blown police chase,"" said Mr Gregory. The court heard Hollis then reversed at ""five miles per hour"" into a police car that parked up behind him on the forecourt. This was accepted to be an accident. Summing up the case, District Judge Grace Leong, said Hollis claimed he was ""not in a hurry"" and it was a ""leisurely drive home"". Hollis said in cross-examination he had been driving at 30mph, but this version was rejected by the judge. The defendant also claimed he had not realised the blue lights were for him but Ms Leong said this was ""utterly implausible"" and he would have seen the lights well before he got to the petrol station. ""Mr Hollis, was very lucky not to be prosecuted for dangerous driving, travelling 60 to 70mph in an area which has traffic calming measures,"" the judge said. On Thursday, Hollis was convicted at the same court of of two counts of harassment against his neighbours. The court heard he had concocted a false knife threat allegation and sent a threatening letter on council-headed paper after they told police he had been hosting meetings in his hot tub. The district judge found him guilty of both charges but also concluded the deputy leader did not hold council meetings in the hot tub during the Covid pandemic. Hollis, of Yew Tree Drive, Huthwaite, will be sentenced for all three offences on 13 October. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

LiveLivePound falls as chancellor cuts income tax and stamp duty,"In a massive shake-up of the UK's finances, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years The financial markets react badly, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar Kwarteng defends the measures, saying they are ""exactly the right thing"" to do The basic rate of income tax is cut to 19p and the 45% top rate of tax for higher earners abolished - although this doesn't apply in Scotland The threshold before stamp duty is paid in England and Northern Ireland is raised to Â£250,000 - for first time buyers it's Â£425,000 The cap on bankers' bonuses is lifted, and a planned rise in corporation tax scrapped An increase in National Insurance is reversed, and low-tax investment zones will be set up across the UK Labour's shadow chancellor says the plan ""will reward the already wealthy"" and will not help those struggling most with rising prices Edited by Dulcie Lee We're going to wrap up our live coverage now - let's take a look at what we learned today: What happened?Kwasi Kwarteng delivered a sweeping mini-budget in his first major speech as chancellor. What was announced? Find an easy-to-read list of all today's announcementshere. How was it received? The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam has had a look at who are the winners and losers from the government's tax cut announcement. The government is borrowing money to fund these tax cuts, pushing up interest rates and that could affect credit card rates and mortgages. Faisal explains. Watch Faisal tell us the purpose behind the government's strategy: This video can not be played Mini-budget: Are there winners and losers? Dharshini DavidGlobal trade correspondent The UK has underperformed compared to our
major competitors - weâre a less efficient and high-earning nation than
we could be. But is cancelling a
planned rise in corporation tax the answer? That rate is already
below France and Germany - and would remain so even if it increased to 25%. Yet that
hasnât revived investment. And with a recession likely looming, some companies
may not even have profits to spare (or tax). So what would help? Some economists have said the
decline in investment became particularly marked from the time of the 2016
referendum as businesses waited to see how Brexit panned out. The International
Monetary Fund is among those who told me that ending the current dispute with the EU over
post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland could help revive investment, by
removing uncertainty. As we've been reporting, the financial markets haven't reacted well to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's economic announcement, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar. But the government's new growth plan is being welcomed by centre-right think tank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), which voiced particular support for the reversal of the National Insurance hike, the cancellation of a rise in corporation tax and the creation of low-tax investment zones. Tom Clougherty, research
director and head of tax at the CPS, says: ""In its overall tone, and in its
specific announcements, this was the best fiscal statement in years. ""No-one can
doubt the new governmentâs commitment or ambition when it comes to making
Britain more prosperous and dynamic."" It's a
big day for businesses with the creation of new ""investment zones"", that will allow planning rules to be relaxed and will reduce business taxes to encourage investment in parts of the country. The chancellor says the government is involved in early discussions with regions across England to establish the new zones, as well as the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Asif
Hamid, chief executive of The Contact Company, a Merseyside-based customer
service company which employs over 1,000 people, said he would be ""really
interested"" if his region became an investment zone. ""We
have got some amazing assets,"" he told the BBC. ""If someone could
supercharge these assets and capabilities and attract investment and encourage
innovation... we have to change and it's part of levelling up."" Liverpool became a free port recently Hamid
said it was important, that local people who ""understand what the
economy and the areas of businesses are"" are consulted by the government
in producing policies aiming to grow different industries. ""I think that's
where the government could make real value on this one,"" he added. Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Within an hour of the chancellor finishing his statement, dozens of people were queuing outside a food bank at All Hallows Church in Leeds. Serving them tea and coffee as they waited in the warm autumnal sunshine, the vicar, the Rev Heston Groenewald, said he was frustrated by what the government had announced this morning. âItâs not going to make positive change in the lives of the folks that we spend our days with. Itâs increasing inequality rather than decreasing it, and that sucks,"" he said. ""I wish they would visit us and walk in the shoes of the people who are struggling with the cost of living crisis. âIt feels as though thereâs a big disconnect between whatâs going on on the ground and the decisions being made in Whitehall.â Simon JackBusiness editor If the UK economy
is to grow, businesses will have to invest. The government's pitch to domestic and
international investors is simple - if you invest, you will pay lower tax, your
workers will take home more pay and regulation will be less onerous. Scrapping the cap on bankers' bonuses is a come hither to international banks who have resented
paying higher basic salaries in Europe because it increases their fixed-costs
relative to their sometimes volatile profits. A new generation of investment
zones will see tax reliefs on investment and big discounts on stamp duty and
business rates. A pledge that planning and environmental obstacles to
development will be removed has been promised before but has often foundered
on concerns of local communities. It remains to be seen whether these measures
will just see firms relocate existing operations rather than spawning new
economic activity. But perhaps the biggest impediment to the kind of investment
the government wants and needs is the short-term nature of the six-month support
package for businesses struggling with their energy bills. Measures to halve the bills firms would have received this winterhave been welcomed but few
businesses plan six months in advance. If anything, heavy selling of both the
pound and UK government bonds signal the rest of the world thinks the UK's
economic prospects may have taken a turn for the worse today. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, says the government
is ""totally out of touch with ordinary people and businesses"" adding
that their plan won't help the ""millions of struggling families faced with
soaring bills for energy, food and mortgages"". He tells the BBC: The Conservatives are prioritising banks and bankers, oil and gas companies and air profits and the 1% richest and that's not what our country needs - we need an economic plan to help everybody.  Davey says a windfall tax on oil and gas companies could raise more than Â£30bn over time to help people with energy costs. He says the government has announced ""irresponsible tax cuts for large companies"" and are ""borrowing recklessly"". As we heard a little earlier, our political editor Chris Mason has questioned Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng about his plans for the economy. One of Kwarteng's colleagues said the plans were ""a massive gamble"" - see how he reacts to that below: This video can not be played Georgina RannardClimate and science reporter In some potentially good news for the climate, the government says it will make it easier to build onshore wind farms in England. It promises to âunlock the potential of onshore windâ by bringing planning rules in line with other infrastructure. Strict planning laws introduced in 2015 effectively stopped the construction of onshore wind farms - an objection from just one person has been enough to stop a project. As well as being good for the planet, onshore wind is a substantial source of cheap energy. In 2011 farms produced enough renewable electricity to power almost 2.4 million households,according to government figures,external. Environmental groups are welcoming the move, saying it was long overdue. But they caution that it follows government plans to lift the ban on fracking and drill for more North Sea oil and gas - both of which threaten the UKâs pledges to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We've been out in Norwich, Norfolk, to gauge people's opinions on today's mini-budget. A couple, who had just bought a house together, will not benefit from the change in stamp duty. See how they, and others, react below: This video can not be played Chris MasonPolitical editor Technically, this wasnât even a Budget. The chancellor didn't wave his red box around on the doorstep of 11 Downing Street. But, inside the blue booklet tucked under his arm as he left for the Commons, were the biggest tax cuts in 50 years. What we have heard today amounts to a wholesale shredding of previous economic policy; both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years, and those of Labour before that. Economic growth, and plenty of it, is the prize sought - but it is a gamble. Ministers can't be certain it will work, nor that the methods used will be popular. They think that doing nothing, the status quo, would be worse - a sluggish economy combined with spiralling prices condemning them to the doom of election defeat. But combine colossal extra borrowing, an acknowledgement the rich will get richer and an economy the Bank of England reckons might already be in recession: together they mean the government has a big persuasion job on its hands, convincing people they know what they're doing, and that we'll all be collectively better off as a result. The government hopes this set of measures will give the economy a giant injection of oomph. It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are bold and stark. And the water is very clear and very blue. Finally, Chris Mason asks the chancellor whether he will acknowledge
that the UKâs economic picture is bleak. Kwarteng responds: ""I donât think itâs bleak, I think there are global challenges - if you look at unemployment, itâs at a 50-year low, if you
look at things in R&D [research and development)] and science and tech, itâs very positive. ""Thereâs a global challenge with electricity prices. Weâre
confident weâve got the right policies to steer us through this and weâre confident
we can grow the economy."" Explaining the reason for scrapping the limits on bankers' bonuses,
Kwarteng says this âis simpleâ. ""Theyâre taxed at nearly 50% now... I want London
to be an international competitive hub. If we look around the world, even in Paris,
bankers are taxed at 30%. ""I donât want bankers to go to Paris, I want them to earn
here."" Asked whether he is worried about the state of the economy given inflation and the value of the pound, the chancellor says that though there are global challenges, his government's intervention is ""exactly the right thing."" ""Clearly Putin's invasion has affected everybody in Europe with higher energy prices,"" he says. But ""our intervention was exactly the right thing,"" he says. ""We simply couldn't tax our way to prosperity, we couldn't simply keep loading people with more tax burdens during the cost of living crisis,"" he says. Our political editor Chris Mason asks why the chancellor has chosen to pile up the borrowing with the mini-budget? Kwarteng responds by stating that the very high energy prices and lack of growth in the UK meant the government had to act to help people. There's been ""a real problem"" with ""sluggish growth"" in the UK, he says. As a result, ""in order to kickstart the economy"", a different approach needed to be taken, which focuses on ""generating growth,"" he explains. ""So what we've done is to try and incentivise investment deliberately,"" he says. ""Broadly, lots of people feel that we've got to get Britain moving,"" he adds. In an interview with our political editor Chris Mason, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is adamant that the government's changes to tax, stamp duty and benefits are not a gamble. ""What was [a gamble] in my view, was sticking to the course we were on."" he says, adding it was ""unsustainable"" to have taxes the highest they had been since
the late 1940s. ""We had to have a reboot, a rethink, pushing growth and incentivising
investment, and critically helping people on lower incomes keep more of the money
they earn."" He says the economy was in the situation it is today due to ""low growth, highest taxes anywhere in the G7 and increasing
those taxes - no other G7 country was increasing taxes to deal with cost of living
crisis"". People are changing sentiment already and weâre very hopeful going into next year, through winter, weâll be in a much better place."" Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng Kwarteng says the Covid-19 pandemic and Putinâs war on Ukraine has had a global effect, and says it was ""absolutely right"" that the government helped people with an energy intervention and a reduced tax burden. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has just been speaking to the BBC about today's mini-budget. She says it's a ""stunning admission from the chancellor"" that the UK is in a vicious cycle of low growth, ""criticising other Conservative governments, of which he has been a part"". Reeves says it's reckless to continue borrowing money, as this generation and future generations will have to fund the costs. She adds, the Conservative government is more concerned about protecting the windfall profit of energy producers, rather than helping families with their energy bills and protecting tax payers against excessive borrowing. Commenting on the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar, Reeves says ""we've seen the verdicts of the markets, they are very worried about the higher borrowing, higher government debt"". ""It's the wrong tax cut, at the wrong time"", Reeves adds. PM Liz Truss and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng visited a business in Kent after the morning's announcement in the Commons If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main events of the day. After announcing a bold set of tax cuts in his mini-budget this morning, the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said today is a ""very good day for the UK"". Speaking to reporters during a visit to a factory in Kent this afternoon, he said the path the UK was on was ""unsustainable"" and it was ""absolutely fair to reduce people's taxes"". But as we've reported, following his mini-budget announcements the British pound has fallen 3% against the dollar. Asked whether the fall was good for the economy, the chancellor said: ""I don't comment on market movements."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Kwarteng defends massive tax cuts as fair for all,"This video can not be played Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on his mini-budget: ""Not a gamble at all"" Kwasi Kwarteng has said massive tax cuts aimed at boosting economic growth are fair for all despite the highest earners gaining the most. The chancellor scrapped the top rate of income tax as part of the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years. Labour and some Tory MPs have said it was wrong to cut taxes for the wealthy during a cost-of-living crisis. But Mr Kwarteng said he was ""being fair"" by reducing taxes right across the income bracket. The package of measures, which has been dubbed a mini-budget, will be paid for by a sharp rise in government borrowing amounting to tens of billions of pounds. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. There was an immediate reaction in financial markets,as the pound sankand UK stocks fell. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Chris Mason: Tax cuts signal radical policy shift Why has the value of the pound tumbled? In an interview with BBC News political editor Chris Mason, the chancellor said: ""I don't think it's a gamble at all. ""What was a gamble, in my view, was sticking to the course we are on."" Mr Kwarteng insisted not cutting taxes and continuing to follow the path of the previous government - led by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson - was more risky. ""So what we had to do was have a reboot, a rethink,"" Mr Kwarteng said. He said his mini-budget was not an admission of failure, asLabour suggested in response to his statement, and a recession forecast by the Bank of England was ""not inevitable"" But, he said, ""we also recognise we could do things better"". He said his moves toreduce income tax, scrap a planned rise in National Insurance and support households with energy bills would ""help the most vulnerable people in society get through a difficult time"". Asked whether the UK economy was now in recession, Mr Kwarteng said that while, ""technically, the Bank of England said that there was a recession"", he thought it ""would be shallow"" and he hoped ""we would rebound and grow"". When pressed, the chancellor said he did not acknowledge that the UK was in recession and that one was not inevitable. The Institute of Fiscal Studies said,externalthe richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who left office in July. Labour's shadow business secretary Seema Malhotra told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""What was really striking today in Parliament was the admission, effectively, of 12 years of failure of what the Conservatives have been doing. ""And Kwasi Kwarteng and his colleagues failed to connect the fact that we've got high taxes because we've had low growth."" She added: ""If you're going to have a plan for growth, it's got to be a proper plan. Even today wasn't a proper plan. Today was a set of tax cuts that are supporting the wealthiest in our society."" Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning Â£1m annually will get a Â£55,000 tax cut next year. Conservative former cabinet minister Julian Smith said the chancellor's decision to hand a ""huge"" tax cut to the wealthy at a time of national crisis was ""wrong"". When Mr Smith's concerns were put to the chancellor, he said the former chief whip ""knows about party loyalty"" and ""lots of people feel we've got to get Britain moving"". Getting the economy moving will, according to Mr Kwarteng, require doing things differently, what he called ""a new approach for a new era, focused on growth"". That new approach will be funded by borrowing, which economists think could climb to Â£120bn within three years. In Parliament, John Glen, a former junior finance minister, pointedly asked Mr Kwarteng about market reaction, saying ""there is a clear concern"" over the level of borrowing needed to afford these tax cuts. As it happened: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth What are the new stamp duty rates? Shock-and-awe tactics from unapologetic chancellor Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office this month, has said she was prepared to make ""unpopular decisions"" to spur economic growth and support those struggling with the rising cost of living. She won the Tory leadership election on a platform of upending what she has called the economic ""orthodoxy"" of the Treasury and reversing tax hikes introduced by her predecessor.

What's been announced?,"The government will reverse almost all tax measures announced in its mini-budget. Plans to cut the basic rate of income tax to 19% have been shelved and support for energy bills scaled back. The mini-budget was only unveiled on 23 September, but caused turmoil on financial markets. What was announced: The basic rate was to be cut to 19% from April 2023. The government said this would save 31 million people Â£170 a year People in England, Wales and Northern Ireland pay 20% on any annual earnings between Â£12,571 to Â£50,270 -rates in Scotland are different,external The rate was already due to be cut in 2024, but this was brought forward What has changed: The basic rate of income tax will remain at 20% Cutting it has been put on hold ""indefinitely"" What was announced: 45% rate of income tax for earnings over Â£150,000 abolished for England, Wales and Northern Ireland taxpayers One single higher rate of income tax of 40% from April next year What has changed: The governmenthad already U-turnedon the cut to the higher rate, which is no longer going ahead What was announced: Cancel UK-wide rise in corporation tax which was due to increasefrom 19% to 25% in April 2023 What has changed: Ms Truss had already announced that UK corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% in April 2023 after all Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? What was announced: The government said atypical household using both gas and electricity would pay Â£2,500 annuallyfor two years.

I will be in place until April next year A Treasury-led review will look at what measures should be put in place after this date How is the energy price cap changing? What was announced: The government had promised to change the rules on off-payroll working,known as IR35,external, so companies were no longer responsible for ensuring their contractors were paying the right amount of tax. It said the current system created ""unnecessary complexity and cost"" for businesses. What has changed: This reform, which the government said would have cost Â£2bn a year, will no longer go ahead. Other measures that have been cancelled include: VAT-free shopping for overseas visitors, which the government said would cost Â£2bn A freeze on alcohol duty, which would have cost Â£600m Cuts to the tax paid on shareholders' dividends.

Reaction from the markets,"The pound has fallen to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as financial markets reacted to the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years. UK stocks also dropped after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a series of tax cuts and economic measures in a massive shake-up of the country's finances. The pound fell more than 3% against the dollar, dropping below $1.09. Sterling has fallen recently over worries about the economy and partly due to a stronger US dollar. The pound also fell more than 1% against the euro on Friday, dropping to â¬1.12. Mr Kwarteng refused to comment on the dropping value of the currency, saying he ""doesn't comment on market movements"". What the mini-budget means for you Why has the value of the pound tumbled? UK may already be in recession - Bank of England The cost of government borrowing soared following the announcement, rising by near-record amounts, as investors did the sums over the new strategy. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect UK interest rates to hit 5.2% in August 2023, with expectations rising that there could be a one percentage point interest rate hike at the Bank of England's next meeting in November. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economic think tank, said the market reaction was ""worrying"" as the government's new strategy relied on investors being willing to lend more to the UK. ""The plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. Mr Johnson said the new strategy would inject demand into a high inflation economy, risking further price rises. At the same time the Bank of England was pulling in the opposite direction, and was likely to raise interest rates even further in response to the Â£45bn tax reduction. The Bank of England needs to make an emergency, unscheduled rate hike as soon as next week ""to regain credibility with the market"", said Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos. He said that move would also send a strong signal that the bank is ""willing to do 'whatever it takes' to bring inflation down quickly"". Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers warned the pound could fall below the dollar due to the huge spending commitments outlined by Mr Kwarteng. ""It makes me very sorry to say, but I think the UK is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market,"" Mr Summers told Bloomberg. ""Between Brexit, how far the Bank of England got behind the curve and now these fiscal policies, I think Britain will be remembered for having pursuing the worst macroeconomic policies of any major country in a long time."" Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said the sell-off of sterling showed investors have doubts about the government's plans. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded. That will result in a large amount of debt at a time when the Bank of England is going to be selling some of its holdings of UK government debt,"" she said. ""I think this government does need to provide a lot more reassurance that it does have fiscal sensibility in order. This is not the message that's come across this morning."" The UK's FTSE 100 index of major shares fell more than 2%, dropping to its lowest level for more than two months, reflecting concerns that the plan to stimulate growth might not pay off. The plan also contributed to a sell-off in US markets, where the three main share indexes fell more than 2%. ""Ultimately, the growth dice have been rolled. But it is too early to know if the gamble will succeed and boost confidence enough to encourage businesses and people to spend and invest, stimulating the UK economy,"" said Karen Campbell-Williams, head of tax at Grant Thornton. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK said there was likely to be a boost to the economy of ""roughly 1%"" over the next year, reducing the risk of a longer recession, but that the longer term outlook was less positive. ""There was nothing in the budget that makes us more optimistic about the long-term growth trend of the economy. Trend growth is currently probably half of the 2.5% the Chancellor has set as his new target,"" he said. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK Government bonds in decades, with some of biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, but it sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here.

What are the new stamp duty rates?,"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels.

"What the mini-budget means for youWill this huge tax cutting gamble pay off?Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?Kwarteng tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says","Described as a mini-budget, or a fiscal event, there was enough affecting your finances in this statement to fill any full-scale Budget. We did not receive any independent forecasts as we would normally expect, but we already know some of the impact on the pounds and pence in your pocket. So, with the cost of living rising, these are the key announcements from Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng which will affect you. Acut in the basic rate of income taxwill be brought forward by a year. In the Spring, Rishi Sunak, when chancellor, pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Now Mr Kwarteng says this will now happen in April 2023, which the government says will benefit 31 million people with an average Â£170 a year reduction in tax. However, people are facing higher bills and the higher cost of borrowing, and more people have been drawn into paying higher tax bands, because the thresholds have been frozen. What is eye-catching is that the chancellor has pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than Â£150,000 a year, in April 2023. That is a tax saving of nearly Â£3,000 a year for somebody earning Â£200,000 annually. It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over Â£50,270, will be the top rate. Income tax bands are different in Scotland, where there arefive different rates,external. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng vows to end 'cycle of stagnation' Anyone on the major benefits - such as universal credit - should expect a rise in what they receive, owing to the link to inflation. However, that will not come until April. Many charities have called for that rise to come earlier. Mr Kwarteng instead concentrated on a plan to cut benefits for those who do not adequately search for work. He said that would mean 120,000 more people on universal credit ""take active steps to seek more and better-paid work, or face having their benefits reduced"". There would be extra support for unemployed people aged over 50 to help get them into work. Stamp duty holidays are often used by governments to encourage activity in the housing market. The theory is that people also spend on things like home improvements and fixtures and fittings after they move, thus boosting economic growth. The tax affects people planning to buy a property. It only applies in England and Northern Ireland. The chancellor said that, instead of a stamp duty holiday, there would bea permanent cut in stamp duty. In detail, it means, the threshold of how much a property has to cost before stamp duty is paid has been changed from Â£125,000 to Â£250,000. First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000, and that will be raised to Â£425,000. Discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers will apply up to Â£625,000, an increase from the previous Â£500,000. Homebuyers in London and the South East of England will benefit the most from this. They pay 65% of all stamp duty as prices are higher and the tax is particularly focused on homes of more than Â£500,000, according to research by Zoopla. Three-quarters (76%) of stamp duty came from homes priced at more than Â£500,000. What are the new stamp duty rates? Although announced a day in advance,the reversal of an increase in National Insuranceloomed large in this mini-budget. It will see the 1.25% rise in National Insurance cancelled on 6 November. The Treasury said the change would save nearly 28 million people an average of Â£330 per year. However, the impact varies considerably depending on what you earn, as there are weekly thresholds for National Insurance. There is nothing to pay on the first Â£242 earned per week, then it is 13.25% on earnings between Â£242.01 and Â£967, and 3.25% on the rest. That means, in general, people who earn more than Â£12,570 a year pay National Insurance, and the more they earn, the more they will benefit from this change. For example, somebody earning Â£20,000 will save about Â£93 a year, and somebody earning Â£100,000 will save Â£1,093, compared to now. The increase in National Insurance was designed to raise money for health and social care, which the government says will now be funded through general taxation. Will National Insurance changes leave me better off? By taking income tax and National Insurance cuts together, someone earning Â£20,000 a year will save Â£167 a year, those earning Â£40,000 will save Â£617, someone getting Â£60,000 will save Â£969, and person on Â£100,000 a year will get an extra Â£1,469, according to accountancy firm EY. Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritshave been cancelled. Grocery prices and energy bills are soaring, so much so that there has been a huge package of support to protect people, to a degree, from unmanageable gas and electricity bills. Despite that help, median earners were expecting to see a 3% (Â£600) fall in real income this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Household support will help make a recession, which the Bank of England says we may already be in, not as deep as previously expected. What are your questions on the chancellor's mini-budget?

"Will this huge tax cutting gamble pay off?Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?Kwarteng tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says","It is an unofficial Budget of staggering size designed to jump start the economy. A Â£12bn corporation tax cut, a Â£17bn National Insurance cut, a Â£5bn basic rate income tax cut, and a Â£2bn cut to the 45p rate. Put together the biggest tax cutting moment for a half a century. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK government bonds in decades, with some of the biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, as it also sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. What the mini-budget means for you At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Pound sinks as investors question huge tax cuts The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. What's the plan? To increase the productivity of the economy and therefore growth over the long term and so tax revenue. The detail of that plan is not in today's announcement. A tax cut that could underpin such a plan is mainly what we got today, alongside some interesting economic reforms, for financial services and enterprise zones. Many of the most important economic policies that could help boost growth were left unmentioned. For example, the last time the Office for Budget Responsibility adjusted UK's long-term growth prospects, it was to cut them, in July, on account of Britain's shrinking workforce. Perhaps worker visas, skills, infrastructure, trade barriers for exporters to Europe will be addressed another time. All contain growth-enhancing policy areas that will test the limits of the PM's acceptance of doing unpopular things. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here. There are considerable risks in this plan, but the government has thrown the kitchen sink at it. It should help growth upfront. As global markets send the interest rates charged to the government rocketing, however, there is a risk that the economy is left in a couple of years having enjoyed a temporary stimulus, and a permanent hangover of high interest rates and high debts. As mortgage rates and commercial borrowing rises, there are risks in the housing market. So there are many gaps left to fill in this plan for growth. The government needs an aspiration to raise growth to become a reality. But the echoes of the last Budget of this size in 1972, which led to an infamous period of boom and bust under chancellor Anthony Barber, will not be comfortable.

"Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?Kwarteng tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says","The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"Kwarteng tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says","This video can not be played Watch: Labour thank Kwarteng for ""demolition"" of Tory record Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget of sweeping tax cuts would ""reward the already wealthy"" and not boost economic growth, Labour has said. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the plan was a Tory ""admission of 12 years of economic failure"". The measures were funded by unnecessary borrowing instead of a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, she added. Mr Kwarteng spent billions on policies he said would shake up the UK's finances and boost economic growth. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Kwarteng abolished the top rate of income tax for the highest earners as he unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts for decades. Live updates: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? What are the new stamp duty rates? His announcements included scrapping a cap on bankers' bonuses, reversing a rise in National Insurance and cutting stamp duty tax - a property purchasing tax - for some buyers. The Institute of Fiscal Studies said,externalthe richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by his predecessor, Rishi Sunak. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning Â£1m annually will get a Â£55,000 tax cut next year. As the UK faces a recession, rising interest rates and soaring energy bills, Ms Reeves said ""the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis"". But Mr Kwarteng argued his economic vision will ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". The Liberal Democrats said the chancellor's plan was ""a recipe for disaster that will leave families suffering from soaring prices while banks and oil and gas companies rake in huge profits"". The Scottish National Party said the Tory government was ""robbing the poor to pay the rich"" and its measures do not go far enough to help people on low incomes. Mr Kwarteng told MPs he was fulfilling new Prime Minister Liz Truss's promise to run a ""tax-cutting government"". ""For too long in this country, we have indulged in a fight over redistribution. Now, we need to focus on growth, not just how we tax and spend,"" he said in his statement. In her response, Ms Reeves congratulated the chancellor ""on his comprehensive demolition"" of the Conservative government's record of the past 12 years. ""Their record, their failure, their vicious circle of stagnation,"" she added. Ms Reeves said borrowing was higher than it needed to be after the Bank of England raised interest rates andwarned the UK may already be in recession. ""This is casino economics - gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country to keep the Tory party happy,"" Ms Reeves said. Mr Kwarteng said tax cuts are ""central to solving the riddle of growth"" She criticised the chancellor for refusing to release an independent forecast of how his tax changes would impact the economy, as the government usually does when it delivers major financial statements. But because Mr Kwarteng's statement was not technically a budget, he said he would release this forecast ""in due course"" before the end of the year. Ms Reeves said without this forecast, the chancellor's statement was ""a budget without figures, a menu without prices"", asking what he had to hide. She referenceda tweet by US President Joe Biden,external, saying he was right to be ""sick and tired"" of ""tickle-down economics"", which was a ""discredited"" theory that would not ""unleash the wave of investment that we need"". She said: ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today - not a plan for growth, a plan to reward the already wealthy. ""A return to the trickle-down of the past, back to the future, not a brave new era."" Income tax to be cut by 1p from April What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

Now Mr Kwarteng says this will now happen in April 2023, which the government says will benefit 31 million people with an average Â£170 a year reduction in tax. However, people are facing higher bills and the higher cost of borrowing, and more people have been drawn into paying higher tax bands, because the thresholds have been frozen. What is eye-catching is that the chancellor has pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than Â£150,000 a year, in April 2023. That is a tax saving of nearly Â£3,000 a year for somebody earning Â£200,000 annually. It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over Â£50,270, will be the top rate. Income tax bands are different in Scotland, where there arefive different rates,external. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng vows to end 'cycle of stagnation' Anyone on the major benefits - such as universal credit - should expect a rise in what they receive, owing to the link to inflation. However, that will not come until April. Many charities have called for that rise to come earlier. Mr Kwarteng instead concentrated on a plan to cut benefits for those who do not adequately search for work. He said that would mean 120,000 more people on universal credit ""take active steps to seek more and better-paid work, or face having their benefits reduced"". There would be extra support for unemployed people aged over 50 to help get them into work. Stamp duty holidays are often used by governments to encourage activity in the housing market. The theory is that people also spend on things like home improvements and fixtures and fittings after they move, thus boosting economic growth. The tax affects people planning to buy a property. It only applies in England and Northern Ireland. The chancellor said that, instead of a stamp duty holiday, there would bea permanent cut in stamp duty. In detail, it means, the threshold of how much a property has to cost before stamp duty is paid has been changed from Â£125,000 to Â£250,000. First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000, and that will be raised to Â£425,000. Discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers will apply up to Â£625,000, an increase from the previous Â£500,000. Homebuyers in London and the South East of England will benefit the most from this. They pay 65% of all stamp duty as prices are higher and the tax is particularly focused on homes of more than Â£500,000, according to research by Zoopla. Three-quarters (76%) of stamp duty came from homes priced at more than Â£500,000. What are the new stamp duty rates? Although announced a day in advance,the reversal of an increase in National Insuranceloomed large in this mini-budget. It will see the 1.25% rise in National Insurance cancelled on 6 November. The Treasury said the change would save nearly 28 million people an average of Â£330 per year. However, the impact varies considerably depending on what you earn, as there are weekly thresholds for National Insurance. There is nothing to pay on the first Â£242 earned per week, then it is 13.25% on earnings between Â£242.01 and Â£967, and 3.25% on the rest. That means, in general, people who earn more than Â£12,570 a year pay National Insurance, and the more they earn, the more they will benefit from this change. For example, somebody earning Â£20,000 will save about Â£93 a year, and somebody earning Â£100,000 will save Â£1,093, compared to now. The increase in National Insurance was designed to raise money for health and social care, which the government says will now be funded through general taxation. Will National Insurance changes leave me better off? By taking income tax and National Insurance cuts together, someone earning Â£20,000 a year will save Â£167 a year, those earning Â£40,000 will save Â£617, someone getting Â£60,000 will save Â£969, and person on Â£100,000 a year will get an extra Â£1,469, according to accountancy firm EY. Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritshave been cancelled. Grocery prices and energy bills are soaring, so much so that there has been a huge package of support to protect people, to a degree, from unmanageable gas and electricity bills. Despite that help, median earners were expecting to see a 3% (Â£600) fall in real income this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Household support will help make a recession, which the Bank of England says we may already be in, not as deep as previously expected. What are your questions on the chancellor's mini-budget?

Who is Kwasi Kwarteng?,"The new chancellor's career shows he is a man who always challenges established thinking. Self-doubt is a concept that has rarely troubled Kwasi Kwarteng. ""Don't worry, I'm sure you'll do very well,"" the teenage Etonian joked to an apologetic admissions tutor, who had turned up late for his interview at Trinity College, Cambridge. With supreme confidence in his intellectual abilities, Mr Kwarteng went on to dazzle audiences across the worlds of academia and politics with his mastery of multiple subjects. ""He wears it extremely heavily,"" says his old Cambridge university friend Dr Catherine Brown. ""But in a way that is extremely charming,"" she adds. Kwasi Kwarteng: A chancellor who won University Challenge Huge tax cuts for millions set to be unveiled UK may already be in recession - Bank of England One theme stands out in Mr Kwarteng's career as an academic and now at the height of politics - this is a man who always challenges established thinking. ""I think he is certainly someone who is not going to be afraid of a big idea - he is not risk averse,"" says the journalist Sarah Sands who has known the chancellor since he was at Cambridge. In Friday's statement to Parliament on his growth plan, the chancellor will slay orthodox Treasury thinking. He will cut taxes with no corresponding spending cuts - all to be funded by increased borrowing. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessays reversing the rise in National Insurance contributions and cutting corporation tax amounts to the biggest tax cut in one event since 1988. Boris Johnson gave Mr Kwarteng his first big job in politics This is a chancellor moving at speed after a relatively slow start to his political career. Mr Kwarteng was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and saw other contemporaries shoot ahead of him up the ministerial ladder. But one event and two people turned round his political fortunes. He was a genuine supporter of Brexit, believing with his historical overview that it was always going to happen. ""We were always going to leave,"" he told friends after the referendum as he moved into the new political mainstream. ""It just happened a little earlier than expected."" Mr Kwarteng was a supporter of Boris Johnson who put him on the ministerial fast-track as energy minister in 2019. Then his political partnership with Liz Truss, a fellow member of the 2010 intake of MPs, paid dividends when she asked her close ally to serve as chancellor. Mr Kwarteng appeared in the winning team for Trinity College, Cambridge, on University Challenge in 1994-95 George Freeman, another member of the 2010 intake, believes that this mini-budget marks a historically significant step. Mr Freeman, who worked under Mr Kwarteng as a business minister, told BBC Newsnight: ""I think it is bold, confident stuff. ""And I think both the prime minister and Kwasi understand that leading in these roles is about confidence, the markets' confidence, public confidence in the economy. ""But it is also quite high risk and I don't think they would demur from that. I think they've understood that slow growth, post-pandemic risk of recession requires bold action."" As an historian, it is little surprise that history instilled in Mr Kwarteng the belief of taking risks. A key influence in his thinking about how to act as chancellor was an essay written by the economist John Maynard Keynes on Andrew Bonar Law, chancellor during World War One and later prime minister. Mr Keynes wrote that Mr Bonar Law was highly accomplished in using his skills as a chess player to prevent political opponents from from going no more than a few moves ahead. Mr Kwarteng saw that as a missed opportunity. Surely better, he thought, to show some flare and deploy the most idiosyncratic piece on the board - the knight. ""Kwasi is a flare of exciting, original thinking,"" Mr Freeman says. ""I think he's probably the most exciting appointment of this reshuffle."" But the veteran former Labour minister, Dame Margaret Hodge, believes the chancellor is embarking on a gamble too far. Dame Margaret told Newsnight: ""I think he's an ideologue who lives in a bubble, who really doesn't understand most ordinary people's lives, who has this sort of theoretical brilliance, but a total lack of pragmatism, which I think creates this chaotic set of policies. ""I can't think how anybody can believe that it is sensible at this time to reintroduce bankers bonuses when everybody else is struggling. ""I mean it's not bold, it's immoral."" Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss will set out a mini-budget on Friday designed to stimulate economic growth Dame Margaret's remarks show Labour believes that the Kwarteng/Truss approach has gifted them a strong line of attack: Tories prioritising tax cuts that will benefit the better off. Mr Kwarteng is unlikely to be troubled by Labour criticism. One of his oldest friends from Cambridge, who is on the Labour left, says Mr Kwarteng never concedes an inch in political debates and mocks her views. But it always done with charm and a laugh. ""There is a political gulf of a Homeric scale between us and yet our friendship bridges it,"" says Dr Catherine Brown, now an English literature academic. And his response to her political views? ""Yeah, he made fun of them."" But Mr Kwarteng once found himself in a minority round Dr Brown's dinner table, prompting a revealing insight into the historian's view of Brexit. ""I think he was the only Brexiteer round this table, which was a table of academics, and he was asked to say something about his position and in defence of his position. ""He actually likened it to the English Reformation. He said that at the time Henry VIII brought that about, Henry didn't know exactly what a Protestant England or Britain was going to look like, nor did his immediate descendants. ""And it took about a century of bloodshed. These are his words. But in the end, it all worked out and Britain sailed on into its glorious future, which I thought was an interesting analogy."" As Mr Kwarteng embarks on an economic experiment he will need results on a rather faster timetable. And he will need those to show that his decision to override Treasury orthodoxy, by cutting taxes now, has delivered strong economic growth. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer?

Kwarteng defends massive tax cuts as fair for allThe chancellor has faced criticism for cutting taxes for the wealthy during a cost-of-living crisis.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on his mini-budget: ""Not a gamble at all"" Kwasi Kwarteng has said massive tax cuts aimed at boosting economic growth are fair for all despite the highest earners gaining the most. The chancellor scrapped the top rate of income tax as part of the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years. Labour and some Tory MPs have said it was wrong to cut taxes for the wealthy during a cost-of-living crisis. But Mr Kwarteng said he was ""being fair"" by reducing taxes right across the income bracket. The package of measures, which has been dubbed a mini-budget, will be paid for by a sharp rise in government borrowing amounting to tens of billions of pounds. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. There was an immediate reaction in financial markets,as the pound sankand UK stocks fell. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Chris Mason: Tax cuts signal radical policy shift Why has the value of the pound tumbled? In an interview with BBC News political editor Chris Mason, the chancellor said: ""I don't think it's a gamble at all. ""What was a gamble, in my view, was sticking to the course we are on."" Mr Kwarteng insisted not cutting taxes and continuing to follow the path of the previous government - led by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson - was more risky. ""So what we had to do was have a reboot, a rethink,"" Mr Kwarteng said. He said his mini-budget was not an admission of failure, asLabour suggested in response to his statement, and a recession forecast by the Bank of England was ""not inevitable"" But, he said, ""we also recognise we could do things better"". He said his moves toreduce income tax, scrap a planned rise in National Insurance and support households with energy bills would ""help the most vulnerable people in society get through a difficult time"". Asked whether the UK economy was now in recession, Mr Kwarteng said that while, ""technically, the Bank of England said that there was a recession"", he thought it ""would be shallow"" and he hoped ""we would rebound and grow"". When pressed, the chancellor said he did not acknowledge that the UK was in recession and that one was not inevitable. The Institute of Fiscal Studies said,externalthe richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who left office in July. Labour's shadow business secretary Seema Malhotra told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""What was really striking today in Parliament was the admission, effectively, of 12 years of failure of what the Conservatives have been doing. ""And Kwasi Kwarteng and his colleagues failed to connect the fact that we've got high taxes because we've had low growth."" She added: ""If you're going to have a plan for growth, it's got to be a proper plan. Even today wasn't a proper plan. Today was a set of tax cuts that are supporting the wealthiest in our society."" Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning Â£1m annually will get a Â£55,000 tax cut next year. Conservative former cabinet minister Julian Smith said the chancellor's decision to hand a ""huge"" tax cut to the wealthy at a time of national crisis was ""wrong"". When Mr Smith's concerns were put to the chancellor, he said the former chief whip ""knows about party loyalty"" and ""lots of people feel we've got to get Britain moving"". Getting the economy moving will, according to Mr Kwarteng, require doing things differently, what he called ""a new approach for a new era, focused on growth"". That new approach will be funded by borrowing, which economists think could climb to Â£120bn within three years. In Parliament, John Glen, a former junior finance minister, pointedly asked Mr Kwarteng about market reaction, saying ""there is a clear concern"" over the level of borrowing needed to afford these tax cuts. As it happened: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth What are the new stamp duty rates? Shock-and-awe tactics from unapologetic chancellor Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office this month, has said she was prepared to make ""unpopular decisions"" to spur economic growth and support those struggling with the rising cost of living. She won the Tory leadership election on a platform of upending what she has called the economic ""orthodoxy"" of the Treasury and reversing tax hikes introduced by her predecessor. Now Mr Kwarteng is putting her economic agenda to the test.

FT: Italy 1-0 England Matt UpsonFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live I think the performance has to be better and cohesive in terms of how the team are going to play together. The movement, understanding and those little partnerships that you operate in different passages. Having to do too much when you've got the ball all the time, it's hard work. I think the players will eventually start to look tired a little bit.

At least be honest. Craig Williams:England under Southgate = Wolves under Lage, clueless going forward. Stats are there for all to see FT: Italy 1-0 England Matt UpsonFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live There weren't any leaping mistakes or errors from Maguire.

FT: Italy 1-0 England Alex HowellBBC Sport at San Siro England boss Gareth Southgate:""It's difficult for me to be too critical of the performance. We had more possession, more shots, more shots on target. ""For large parts of the game we played very well. We didnât deal with the decisive moment defensively. We had moments where we had the chance to be decisive in their final third which our quality wasn't quite right. ""Itâs a spell where ultimately results are going to be the thing that everyone reacts to but I thought there were a lot of positives for us as a team tonight. ""Lots of good individual performances. I personally thought the performance is a step in the right direction. I completely understand because of the result that is not going to be the reaction.""

FT: Italy 1-0 England Andros TownsendEverton midfielder on 5 Live The biggest frustration was how deep England were as a collective and group. They need to be a bit higher up to start with so when you regain possession, you are already in the midfield third or final third. When England regain possession, Italy win their own half.

LiveLiveLaver Cup: Federer's final match plus Murray v De Minaur11 minutes ago,"Laver Cup: Roger Federer's final competitive match at London's O2 Arena Federer and Rafael Nadal beaten 4-6 7-6 11-9 by Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe in doubles match 'I'm happy, not sad' says Federer in emotional on-court interview Great rival Nadal also in tears sat next to Federer at end of match Swiss legend, 41, won 20 Grand Slam titles but had not played since Wimbledon 2021 because of knee injury Andy Murray beaten 5-7 6-3 10-7 by Alex de Minaur in opening match of evening session Team Europe 2-2 Team World after first day of Ryder Cup-style tournament Matt Gault Sport often fails to deliver the fairytale ending we all want to see. Tonight was a reminder of that. Roger Federer, who for the last two decades has been synonymous sporting excellence, brought the curtain down on his 24-year career with a doubles defeat alongside long-time adversary Rafael Nadal as the Team Europe duo fell to Team World's Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock. But let's not kid ourselves: the result is largely irrelevant. If tonight was about celebrating one of the all-time greats (or, for many, the GOAT), then it has to be viewed as a resounding success. Federer said so himself. ""It does feel like a celebration to me. I wanted to feel like this at the end and it is exactly what I hoped for so thank you. It has been a perfect journey and I would do it all over again."" We'd love to do it all over again, too, but at least we'll always have the memories. Thanks for following the live text tonight. If you're not caught up, Jonathan Jurejko was at the O2 Arena towatch Federer's final act unfold. Goodnight. Federer/Nadal v Sock/Tiafoe People inside the world of tennis have been heaping praise on Roger Federer for 20 years now. Now seems a good time to share some great quotes about him: ""If you want to be a tennis player, then mould yourself on Roger Federer. I won three Wimbledon titles and I wish I could play like him"" -John McEnroe ""The best way to beat him would be to hit him over the head with a racket"" -Rod Laver ""In the modern game, you're a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist or a hard court specialist...or you're Roger Federer"" -Jimmy Connors ""He's a real person. He's not an enigma. Off the court he's not trying to be somebody. If you met him at McDonald's and you didn't know who he was, you would have no idea that he's one of the best athletes in the world"" -Andy Roddick ""Roger can produce tennis shots that should be declared illegal"" -Tracy Austin ""If he's playing very good, I have to play unbelievable. If not, it's impossible. When he's 100%, he's playing in another league. It's impossible to stop him"" -Rafael Nadal ""I don't think you can always, or you can ever, get your game to perfection. Only if you are Federer"" -Novak Djokovic #bbctennis Matthew Vernon:Who else could reduce their greatest rival to tears the way Roger has Rafa. Such respect and love between the two of them, proof rivalry doesn't have to be toxic, it can lead to excellence. We will miss them both so much and have been so lucky to witness their battles. Abid:What a legend. Even Rafa is crying!

Tennis won't be the same. There's Rod Laver, offering Federer a big handshake and some sage words of advice. And now it's time for hugs from the kids. ""I'm happy, I'm not sad."" Mum and dad come over for a hug, too, with Ellie Goulding belting out 'Burn' in the background. Mirka has come down from the crowd and gives her husband a big hug. A special moment for them. Damn. Federer, on the support of his family:""Everyone's here, the boys and girls. My wife has been so supportive. She could have stopped me a long, long time ago but she didn't. She kept me going and allowed me to play, so it's amazing - thank you. ""It's funny, we always blame my mum for everything because without her I wouldn't be here of course. Thanks to my parents, they've been amazing. ""Just everybody, there are too many people to thank. It's been incredible."" And now, Ellie Goulding is going to sing a song. More Federer quotes to come... Barely a dry eye in the house, folks. Nadal wells up as he claps his great friend and rival. Asked about his family, Federer says, ""do we have to go there?"" as he tries to keep it together. Roger Federer, on the last day of his tennis career:""We'll get through this somehow. It's been a wonderful day. I told the guys I'm happy, not sad. It feels great to be here. I enjoyed tying my shoelaces one more, every thing was the last time. ""I didn't feel the stress so much even though I thought maybe something was going to go, like a calf, but the match was great. ""Playing with Rafa and having all the greats here, all the legends, thank you."" Federer wipes away a few tears as he watches a video recapping his career on the big screen. We're going to hear from the man himself soon. But first, a tear-jerker of a video to watch. #bbctennis Andrew Priestley:Farewell to not only a tennis great, but a sporting icon. Many will have their own opinions, but in mine, he is the greatest. The catalyst for the greatest era in tennis history, Roger Federer will be sorely missed on the courts of the world. The end of an era. The end of an incredible career. Federer returns to the court and salutes the crowd. It's not the ending he wanted, but what a send-off this is. The atmosphere out there has been electric. Federer goes across and embraces his team-mates. He's in tears now. He's not the only one choking up right now... Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-11 Sock/Tiafoe It's all over. Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe beat Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, bringing the curtain down on Federer's career. Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-10 Sock/Tiafoe* Frances Tiafoe hammers a forehand past Rafa Nadal and it's match point for Team World... Â© 2025 BBC.

Sexual assault claims revealed in Goldman case,"Women at Goldman Sachs reported 75 incidents of sexual assault and harassment involving senior bankers between 2000 and 2011, including rape, according to newly public court files. The claims are part of a class-action lawsuit in New York accusing the financial giant of discriminating against women's pay and promotion. The suit, which now represents roughly 1,400 women, is set for trial in June. Goldman has been fighting the case since 2010 and denies claims of bias. It said many of the complaints were two decades old and had been ""presented selectively, inaccurately and are incomplete"". ""The plaintiffs' presentation of the complaints does not reflect reality at Goldman Sachs,"" a spokesperson said. ""Discrimination, harassment and mistreatment in any form are unacceptable at Goldman Sachs, and when identified, swift action, including termination, is taken. Out of respect for the persons involved, we are not going to comment on the individual complaints."" Cristina Chen-Oster, a former vice president who worked for the bank from 1997 to 2005 and was one of the three women who filed the initial complaint, said she was looking forward to sharing her experience at trial. Cristina Chen-Oster was one of three women who filed the original complaint ""I hope this case will help to finally break the glass ceiling for women on Wall Street and set a precedent for other industries where gender discrimination is pervasive,"" she said. ""We need to bring transparency to practices that previously seemed untouchable."" The lawsuit says women at Goldman were paid and promoted less, as a result of a pattern of discriminatory practices, including a ""boys' club"" work culture that permitted the sexualisation of female staff. Goldman is accused of tolerating managers who engage in sexual harassment, such as one who rang a bell every time a woman entered the floor. He was later promoted to managing director, according to the complaint. The incidents of alleged sexual assault reported to the firm included a female employee who claimed she was drugged and raped after a company baseball game. Another female employee alleged that a male manager took her to an abandoned floor and propositioned her for sex; he later called to say he was ""masturbating to the sound of her voice"", the complaint says. The complaint says Goldman retaliated against women who complained about the issue, as well as those who went on maternity leave. In Ms Chen-Oster's experience, outlined in the initial complaint, she describes having a married male colleague pin her ""against a wall, kissing and groping her"" after a company dinner. She alleges that she was consistently paid less and denied opportunities, noting that Goldman removed responsibilities after she went on maternity leave and assigned her a seat among female support staff. ""The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that year after year Goldman continues to treat women as second-class employees, permitting a culture of fear and retaliation to flourish rather than fixing known, systemic gender bias,"" the lawsuit alleges. Lawyers are asking the court to order reinstatement or damages for the women, who according to the suit were paid 20% less than their male counterparts if they were vice presidents, while female associates earned 8% less.

Liverpool fans to sue Uefa over final chaos,"Liverpool fans were left stuck outside the ground and the match was delayed by 35 minutes More than 1,700 Liverpool fans who claim they were injured or left with psychological trauma at the chaotic Champions League Final are to sue Uefa, lawyers have said. European football's governing body is facing group actions over the final against Real Madrid in Paris. Uefa delayed kick-off by 35 minutes, citing ""security issues"". Liverpool law firm Bingham's said clients had spoken of ""terrifying scenes"" at the Stade de France. Bingham's has teamed up with global law company Pogust Goodhead in a lawsuit for 1,450 clients alleging negligence. Lawyers said they would sue Uefa for breach of contract in ticket sales and negligence over a duty of care they had towards supporters, who were harmed physically and psychologically.Â Many Reds supporters spoke oflong queues in the hours leading up to the gameand a heavy-handed police response to the build-up of fans. Fans were tear-gassed by police and attacked and robbed by locals. Gerard Long from Binghams said: ""As a life-long Liverpool fan, I was absolutely horrified when I heard how events unfolded at what should have been the highlight of the football season. ""Not only fellow fans, but my friends, family and clients who were in attendance that day have spoken of the terrifying scenes that surrounded the Stade de France before, and even after, the game."" Another law firm, Leigh Day, is also bringing actions. It said it believed Uefa ""failed to provide a safe and secure environment"" for fans. Consumer and travel law experts Clare Campbell and Jill Paterson, who are leading Leigh Day's action, said: ""It was truly shocking to see how Liverpool fans and others who had travelled to watch the Champions League final were treated both at the match and in the aftermath. ""The accounts of their experiences paint a picture of a terrifying situation where people really feared for their lives."" Leigh Day, which has offices in Liverpool, is representing 400 clients. Liverpool FC has gathered 8,500 testimonies from supporters on their experiences that day to submit toan independent review, commissioned by Uefa. Club chief executive Billy Hogan said they ""suffered harrowing experiences"". Uefapreviously apologised to Liverpool and Real Madrid fanscaught up in the events around the final and said it must not happen again. A Uefa representative said the independent review report into what happened would be published in November and the organisation would not make any comment on the topic until then.

She kept me going and allowed me to play, so it's amazing - thank you. ""It's funny, we always blame my mum for everything because without her I wouldn't be here of course. Thanks to my parents, they've been amazing. ""Just everybody, there are too many people to thank. It's been incredible."" And now, Ellie Goulding is going to sing a song. More Federer quotes to come... Barely a dry eye in the house, folks. Nadal wells up as he claps his great friend and rival. Asked about his family, Federer says, ""do we have to go there?"" as he tries to keep it together. Roger Federer, on the last day of his tennis career:""We'll get through this somehow. It's been a wonderful day. I told the guys I'm happy, not sad. It feels great to be here. I enjoyed tying my shoelaces one more, every thing was the last time. ""I didn't feel the stress so much even though I thought maybe something was going to go, like a calf, but the match was great. ""Playing with Rafa and having all the greats here, all the legends, thank you."" Federer wipes away a few tears as he watches a video recapping his career on the big screen. We're going to hear from the man himself soon. But first, a tear-jerker of a video to watch. #bbctennis Andrew Priestley:Farewell to not only a tennis great, but a sporting icon. Many will have their own opinions, but in mine, he is the greatest. The catalyst for the greatest era in tennis history, Roger Federer will be sorely missed on the courts of the world. The end of an era. The end of an incredible career. Federer returns to the court and salutes the crowd. It's not the ending he wanted, but what a send-off this is. The atmosphere out there has been electric. Federer goes across and embraces his team-mates. He's in tears now. He's not the only one choking up right now... Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-11 Sock/Tiafoe It's all over. Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe beat Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, bringing the curtain down on Federer's career. Federer/Nadal 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 9-10 Sock/Tiafoe* Frances Tiafoe hammers a forehand past Rafa Nadal and it's match point for Team World... Â© 2025 BBC.

Russia reveals exemptions as men flee call-up,"Russian soldiers have been accused of torturing civilians while in detention Russia's defence ministry has revealed a host of occupations it says will be exempted from conscription aimed at boosting its war effort in Ukraine. IT workers, bankers and journalists working for state media will escape the ""partial mobilisation"" announced by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. Around 300,000 citizens face being called up as part of the drive. The move has prompted a rush towards borders as young men attempt to flee to evade the draft. Announcing the exemptions on Friday, Russia's defence ministry said employers must compile a list of workers who meet the criteria and submit it to its offices. But it accepted some sectors had to be excluded to ""ensure the work of specific high-tech industries, as well as Russia's financial system"". Some commentators have observed that the text of the mobilisation decree has been left vague - potentially allowing it to be widened if necessary. And one paragraph remains entirely classified. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday this referred to the total number of Russians who could be conscripted, which he said could not be disclosed. Earlier, the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta had reported - citing an unnamed government source - that the redacted section allowed for a call-up of up to a million people, rather than the reported 300,000. Others have cast doubt on the truth of the Kremlin's pledges to limit the draft. Just two weeks ago Mr Peskov told reporters that there had been ""no discussion"" of mobilisation by Russian leaders. And across the country, reports have been emerging of Russian men who do not meet the criteria being called up by local recruiting officers. The Russian daily newspaper Kommersant reported that men previously exempted from service for health reasons had been called up by the local commander in the Siberian region of Irkutsk. Elsewhere, Russian men are continuing to try to flee the country to avoid being called up by recruiters for the country's first military mobilisation since World War Two. In the south, miles-long queues of traffic have formed at the border crossing between Russia and Georgia. Some of those heading into the neighbouring country have used bicycles to bypass lines of cars and evade a ban on crossing on foot, with others reporting waits of up to 12 hours. This video can not be played Watch: Sped-up footage appears to show large queues at the Russia-Georgia border When asked about the war, one man who did not wish to be named told the BBC he had known it was happening but that, until Mr Putin's declaration of a ""partial mobilisation"", it had not been his concern. A Russian student, who also did not want to be identified, said that people had woken up. ""They opened their eyes and started thinking about where to hide their children. Now people understand what's happening because it affects them directly,"" he said. Another IT worker told the BBC that he was opposed to the war, but was too scared to speak out against it. ""I don't want to risk my life, the life of my family. I don't want to be put in detention,"" he said. ""All I could do was to get Schengen visa. Luckily I got one in May."" Georgia is one of the few neighbouring countries that Russians can enter without needing to apply for a visa. Border guards in neighbouring Finland, which shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with Russia but requires an entry visa, told the BBC that queues had grown at various crossing points. ""'What's happening in Russia now is total fear'"" ""I will break my arm, my leg... anything to avoid the draft"" What does Russian military call-up mean for Ukraine? Other destinations reachable by air - such as Istanbul, Belgrade or Dubai - saw ticket prices skyrocket immediately after the military call-up was announced, with some destinations sold out completely. Turkish media have reported a large spike in one-way ticket sales, while remaining flights to non-visa destinations can cost thousands of euros. Several countries are grappling with the prospect of an influx of Russian draft avoiders. Germany's interior minister signalled on Thursday that those fleeing conscription would be welcome in her country. Nancy Faeser said deserters threatened by ""severe repression"" would receive protection on a case-by-case basis, following security checks. But several other European countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Czech Republic, struck a different tone, saying they would not offer fleeing Russians refuge. The countries have long pushed the EU to take a harder line on Russia. ""I understand that Russians are fleeing from ever more desperate decisions by Putin,"" Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said. ""But those running because they don't want to fulfil a duty imposed by their own government, they don't meet the criteria for humanitarian visa."" The call-up sparked protests in major Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg on Tuesday, resulting in a reported 1,300 arrests. There were also reports from Russia that some of those detained for protesting had been handed draft papers while in custody at police stations. When asked about the reports, Mr Peskov said that doing so was not against the law.

Dï»¿rag Race UK star Cherry Valentine dies aged 28,"Ward's family described his death at the age of 28 as a ""profound shock"" Drag performer George Ward, known by his stage name Cherry Valentine, has died at the age of 28, his family have announced. Ward appeared on the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK and went on to front the BBC documentary Gypsy Queen And Proud. A statement from his family described his death as a ""profound shock"". Ward, who died on Sunday, was raised in Darlington, County Durham as part of the Traveller community. He qualified as a mental health nurse in 2015, before starting his career in drag. ""It is with the most heart-wrenching and deepest sadness to inform you that our George - Cherry Valentine - has tragically passed away,"" Ward's family said. ""This will come as a profound shock to most people and we understand there is no easy way for this to be announced."" Ward performed as Cherry Valentine on RuPaul's Drag Race UK ""As his family, we are still processing his death and our lives will never be the same,"" they added. ""We understand how much he is loved and how many lives he has inspired and touched. All we ask is for your patience and your prayers in this time. We love you Georgie."" In December 2020, Ward was announced as one of 12 contestants competing in the second series of the UK version of RuPaul's Drag Race, which is broadcast on BBC Three. In his introductory video for the show, he described his Cherry Valentine alter-ego as ""glamour"", ""dark"" and ""gothic"". He said his work as a nurse had ""put me in that right position to be able to understand people a bit more"". ""If you are a drag queen you are working with people. And to understand people I think you go the extra mile."" After appearing on the show, Ward joined with the BBC to produce a documentary exploring his Traveller heritage, calledGypsy Queen And Proud. He revisited the community he left aged 18 as part of the programme. Ward also performed publicly and appeared opposite Charli XCX in the music video for her singleGood Ones.,external RuPaul's Drag Race is known for the glitz, the glamour and the hilarity but beneath the make-up and the glitter, at its heart are the personalities and lives of the much-loved contestants. Cherry Valentine brought all of that not just on the stage, but behind the scenes with the open way she talked about her own experiences. She shared her difficulties growing up LGBT in the Traveller community, giving a voice to a subject and people that many may not know about. Cherry spoke strongly about the importance of mental health, having qualified as a mental health nurse before venturing into the world of drag. She once described drag as a ""lifeline"" during the Covid pandemic in which she was involved in the vaccine effort. She too touched the lives of so many who will be shocked by the loss of someone whose performances on stage were as inspiring as those away from the camera. Being interviewed for the launch of Drag Race UK in January 2021, Ward explained he was introduced to the drag scene while a student at Lancaster University. ""I went to Manchester for a couple of nights out and thought: 'This is crazy, this is what I want to do.' That's when Cherry was born,"" he said. Cherry Valentine was described as an ""incredible queen"" by fans ""I did drag in Darlington behind the scenes. It was a case of doing it when your parents are out of the house and dressing up in your mother's clothes, strutting round the house in nails."" Speaking about taking part in the show, he said: ""I just wanted to go on and show wherever you come from, whoever you are, you can do whatever makes you happy."" Following the news of Ward's death,BBC Three controller Fiona Campbell said:,external""We are all shocked and heartbroken to hear the news of the passing of George, known to many as Cherry Valentine. A fan favourite and an inspiration to so many, we were privileged to have worked with him."" Good Morning Britain presenterCharlotte Hawkins tweeted:,external""Very sad to hear that Cherry Valentine has died, aged just 28. We met back in June at Epsom - so full of life then, it's hard to believe. Sending love to George's family & friends, just heartbreaking."" Fans of the show also posted social media tributes to Ward on Friday following the news of his death. Singer Jack Remmington described Ward,externalas ""a brilliant drag performer who did so much for this world both as a nurse, and as representation for the gypsy community"". ""In such sad shock at the news of Cherry Valentine,""added writer and journalist Harrison Brocklehurst.,external""What an absolutely incredible queen."" Journalist Emma Kelly said,externalWard's death was ""horribly tragic"", whileBen Smoke described it,externalas ""a horrifying loss"". Ward was gender-fluid,externaland used he/they pronouns, and she/her when in drag as Cherry Valentine.

Ronaldo charged by FA over fan phone incident,"Ronaldo appeared to knock a young fan's phone to the ground as he walked down the tunnel at Goodison Park on 9 April this year Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo has been charged by the Football Association over footage which appeared to show him knocking a phone out of a fan's hand. A video was shared on social media alongside comments claiming he smashed the device as he left the pitch after a1-0 loss at Evertonin April. Ronaldo, 37, later apologised on social media. He wascautioned by policeregarding the incident in August. ""It is alleged that the forward's conduct after the final whistle was improper and/or violent,"" the FA said in a statement. Manchester United said they would support Ronaldo in his response to the charge. The defeat at Everton dealt a blow to United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. They went on to finish sixth. In anInstagram post,externalafter the incident, Ronaldo said it was ""never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing"". He added: ""Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ""I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair play and sportsmanship."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: This is an unprecedented case and regarded as non-standard, so there will be a hearing whether Ronaldo accepts the charge or not. It could result in anything ranging from a warning to a suspension. Tottenham's Eric Dier was banned for four matches two years ago when hewent into the stand to confront a fanwho had been in an argument with a family member. It is an issue Ronaldo could have done without after a difficult summer during which he failed to get his desired move to a Champions League club and started the season on the bench under new manager Erik ten Hag.

Major tax cuts herald new era for UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Stamp duty to income tax - What to know about Kwarteng's 'new era' Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, as he hailed a ""new era"" for the UK economy. Income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in business taxes have been scrapped. Mr Kwarteng said a major change of direction was needed to kick start economic growth. But Labour said it would not solve the cost-of-living crisis and was a ""plan to reward the already wealthy"". It comes as the Bank of Englandwarns the UK may already be in recession. The pound sank to a fresh 37-year low against the dollaras the chancellor gave his statement. Live updates: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng admits Tory economic failure, says Labour What are the new stamp duty rates? In a departure from Boris Johnson's economic policies, Mr Kwarteng has scrapped plans to push up taxes to pay for public services, with the aim of boosting economic growth. In a Commons statement, being dubbed a mini-budget, he said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"", reducing the incentive to work and for businesses to invest. He announced that the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one percentage point to 19% in April- one year earlier than planned. He also unveiled a cut to the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, meaning the UK will have a single higher rate from April. Other measures include: The threshold people in England and Northern Irelandstart paying stamp duty on home purchases will rise to Â£250,000 For first-time buyers the threshold will rise to Â£425,000 and the value of the property they can claim relief will increase from Â£500,000 to Â£625,000 Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritswill be axed The cap on bankers' bonuseswill be lifted New investment zones, where business will benefit from tax cuts and planning rules will be relaxed to encourage house building, will be established Mr Kwartengfulfilled promises to reverse the rise in National Insurance payments introduced by Mr Johnsonto pay for social care and tackle the NHS backlog. He confirmed a planned corporation tax increase from 19% to 25% would also be scrapped. The total cost of the permanent tax cuts announced by the chancellor are estimated at almost Â£45bn by 2027, which the chancellor said would ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". ""We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth,"" he added. Government borrowing will increase by Â£72bn as a result of the announcements, according to the Treasury. The changes to income tax do not apply in Scotland but cuts to corporation tax and national insurance are UK-wide. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the statement amounted to the biggest tax cuts since the 1972 Budget, with the cuts 50% bigger than had been expected. He said that the UK could be borrowing Â£120bn in three years' time to afford the measures. Mr Johnson added that the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. However, he said they were ""manageable"" if economic growth ""really picks up"". This is not a mini-budget. This is a radical tax-cutting economic intervention, which is a significant change of course. Boris Johnson's tax plans have been junked. Many households will save some money, but some of the biggest tax cuts will be for those with the biggest salaries. And this will cost a lot of money. The chancellor's calculation is that it's worth it. People need help with bills and slashing tax will stimulate growth. If you grow the economy, there will be more tax raised and that will help pay the debt in the medium term. But many are sceptical it will work. Senior Conservatives have been warning for months that the strategy is wrong and will saddle future generations with debt. Opposition parties believe the government has the wrong priorities with tax cuts for the wealthy and should be raising more money from a windfall tax on energy company profits. The Treasury hasn't said when it expects to achieve its desired economic growth. But the chancellor is determined to press ahead with a radical change of direction. The big question now: will it work? Labour described his statement as ""an admission of 12 years of economic failure"". ""The Conservatives cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis, and our country cannot afford them anymore,"" shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said. ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today. Not a plan for growth. A plan to reward the already wealthy. A return to the trickle-down of the past. Back to the future, not a brave new era."" Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This was the billionaire's budget, showing the Conservatives are completely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills."" This video can not be played Watch: Labour says Tories created 'vicious circle of stagnation' The statement also included details of the cost of the government's plan to cap energy bills for households and businesses. Mr Kwarteng said these estimated costs were ""particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices"" but based on recent prices the total cost of the package for the six months from October was expected to be around Â£60bn. ""We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long-term energy contracts with suppliers,"" he added. The government normally releases an independent forecast of how major tax changes will impact the economy, but Mr Kwarteng has opted not to do this, as his statement is not technically a Budget. However, Mr Kwarteng promised the Office for Budget Responsibility would publish a full economic forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year. The huge increase in borrowing comes at a time when inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high, leading to higher interest payments. On Thursday the Bank of England raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - in an attempt to cool soaring prices.

Sexual assault claims revealed in Goldman bias suit,"Women at Goldman Sachs reported 75 incidents of sexual assault and harassment involving senior bankers between 2000 and 2011, including rape, according to newly public court files. The claims are part of a class-action lawsuit in New York accusing the financial giant of discriminating against women's pay and promotion. The suit, which now represents roughly 1,400 women, is set for trial in June. Goldman has been fighting the case since 2010 and denies claims of bias. It said many of the complaints were two decades old and had been ""presented selectively, inaccurately and are incomplete"". ""The plaintiffs' presentation of the complaints does not reflect reality at Goldman Sachs,"" a spokesperson said. ""Discrimination, harassment and mistreatment in any form are unacceptable at Goldman Sachs, and when identified, swift action, including termination, is taken. Out of respect for the persons involved, we are not going to comment on the individual complaints."" Cristina Chen-Oster, a former vice president who worked for the bank from 1997 to 2005 and was one of the three women who filed the initial complaint, said she was looking forward to sharing her experience at trial. Cristina Chen-Oster was one of three women who filed the original complaint ""I hope this case will help to finally break the glass ceiling for women on Wall Street and set a precedent for other industries where gender discrimination is pervasive,"" she said. ""We need to bring transparency to practices that previously seemed untouchable."" The lawsuit says women at Goldman were paid and promoted less, as a result of a pattern of discriminatory practices, including a ""boys' club"" work culture that permitted the sexualisation of female staff. Goldman is accused of tolerating managers who engage in sexual harassment, such as one who rang a bell every time a woman entered the floor. He was later promoted to managing director, according to the complaint. The incidents of alleged sexual assault reported to the firm included a female employee who claimed she was drugged and raped after a company baseball game. Another female employee alleged that a male manager took her to an abandoned floor and propositioned her for sex; he later called to say he was ""masturbating to the sound of her voice"", the complaint says. The complaint says Goldman retaliated against women who complained about the issue, as well as those who went on maternity leave. In Ms Chen-Oster's experience, outlined in the initial complaint, she describes having a married male colleague pin her ""against a wall, kissing and groping her"" after a company dinner. She alleges that she was consistently paid less and denied opportunities, noting that Goldman removed responsibilities after she went on maternity leave and assigned her a seat among female support staff. ""The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that year after year Goldman continues to treat women as second-class employees, permitting a culture of fear and retaliation to flourish rather than fixing known, systemic gender bias,"" the lawsuit alleges. Lawyers are asking the court to order reinstatement or damages for the women, who according to the suit were paid 20% less than their male counterparts if they were vice presidents, while female associates earned 8% less.

Kwasi Kwarteng: Politician who challenges orthodoxy,"The new chancellor's career shows he is a man who always challenges established thinking. Self-doubt is a concept that has rarely troubled Kwasi Kwarteng. ""Don't worry, I'm sure you'll do very well,"" the teenage Etonian joked to an apologetic admissions tutor, who had turned up late for his interview at Trinity College, Cambridge. With supreme confidence in his intellectual abilities, Mr Kwarteng went on to dazzle audiences across the worlds of academia and politics with his mastery of multiple subjects. ""He wears it extremely heavily,"" says his old Cambridge university friend Dr Catherine Brown. ""But in a way that is extremely charming,"" she adds. Kwasi Kwarteng: A chancellor who won University Challenge Huge tax cuts for millions set to be unveiled UK may already be in recession - Bank of England One theme stands out in Mr Kwarteng's career as an academic and now at the height of politics - this is a man who always challenges established thinking. ""I think he is certainly someone who is not going to be afraid of a big idea - he is not risk averse,"" says the journalist Sarah Sands who has known the chancellor since he was at Cambridge. In Friday's statement to Parliament on his growth plan, the chancellor will slay orthodox Treasury thinking. He will cut taxes with no corresponding spending cuts - all to be funded by increased borrowing. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studiessays reversing the rise in National Insurance contributions and cutting corporation tax amounts to the biggest tax cut in one event since 1988. Boris Johnson gave Mr Kwarteng his first big job in politics This is a chancellor moving at speed after a relatively slow start to his political career. Mr Kwarteng was first elected to Parliament in 2010 and saw other contemporaries shoot ahead of him up the ministerial ladder. But one event and two people turned round his political fortunes. He was a genuine supporter of Brexit, believing with his historical overview that it was always going to happen. ""We were always going to leave,"" he told friends after the referendum as he moved into the new political mainstream. ""It just happened a little earlier than expected."" Mr Kwarteng was a supporter of Boris Johnson who put him on the ministerial fast-track as energy minister in 2019. Then his political partnership with Liz Truss, a fellow member of the 2010 intake of MPs, paid dividends when she asked her close ally to serve as chancellor. Mr Kwarteng appeared in the winning team for Trinity College, Cambridge, on University Challenge in 1994-95 George Freeman, another member of the 2010 intake, believes that this mini-budget marks a historically significant step. Mr Freeman, who worked under Mr Kwarteng as a business minister, told BBC Newsnight: ""I think it is bold, confident stuff. ""And I think both the prime minister and Kwasi understand that leading in these roles is about confidence, the markets' confidence, public confidence in the economy. ""But it is also quite high risk and I don't think they would demur from that. I think they've understood that slow growth, post-pandemic risk of recession requires bold action."" As an historian, it is little surprise that history instilled in Mr Kwarteng the belief of taking risks. A key influence in his thinking about how to act as chancellor was an essay written by the economist John Maynard Keynes on Andrew Bonar Law, chancellor during World War One and later prime minister. Mr Keynes wrote that Mr Bonar Law was highly accomplished in using his skills as a chess player to prevent political opponents from from going no more than a few moves ahead. Mr Kwarteng saw that as a missed opportunity. Surely better, he thought, to show some flare and deploy the most idiosyncratic piece on the board - the knight. ""Kwasi is a flare of exciting, original thinking,"" Mr Freeman says. ""I think he's probably the most exciting appointment of this reshuffle."" But the veteran former Labour minister, Dame Margaret Hodge, believes the chancellor is embarking on a gamble too far. Dame Margaret told Newsnight: ""I think he's an ideologue who lives in a bubble, who really doesn't understand most ordinary people's lives, who has this sort of theoretical brilliance, but a total lack of pragmatism, which I think creates this chaotic set of policies. ""I can't think how anybody can believe that it is sensible at this time to reintroduce bankers bonuses when everybody else is struggling. ""I mean it's not bold, it's immoral."" Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss will set out a mini-budget on Friday designed to stimulate economic growth Dame Margaret's remarks show Labour believes that the Kwarteng/Truss approach has gifted them a strong line of attack: Tories prioritising tax cuts that will benefit the better off. Mr Kwarteng is unlikely to be troubled by Labour criticism. One of his oldest friends from Cambridge, who is on the Labour left, says Mr Kwarteng never concedes an inch in political debates and mocks her views. But it always done with charm and a laugh. ""There is a political gulf of a Homeric scale between us and yet our friendship bridges it,"" says Dr Catherine Brown, now an English literature academic. And his response to her political views? ""Yeah, he made fun of them."" But Mr Kwarteng once found himself in a minority round Dr Brown's dinner table, prompting a revealing insight into the historian's view of Brexit. ""I think he was the only Brexiteer round this table, which was a table of academics, and he was asked to say something about his position and in defence of his position. ""He actually likened it to the English Reformation. He said that at the time Henry VIII brought that about, Henry didn't know exactly what a Protestant England or Britain was going to look like, nor did his immediate descendants. ""And it took about a century of bloodshed. These are his words. But in the end, it all worked out and Britain sailed on into its glorious future, which I thought was an interesting analogy."" As Mr Kwarteng embarks on an economic experiment he will need results on a rather faster timetable. And he will need those to show that his decision to override Treasury orthodoxy, by cutting taxes now, has delivered strong economic growth. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer?

Income tax to be cut by 1p from April,"The majority of taxpayers will pay one penny less in income tax in the pound from April next year. New chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said the cut in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19% would benefit more than 31 million people. The cut, which applies to annual earnings between Â£12,571 to Â£50,270, comes a year earlier than planned. In a surprise move, the 45% highest tax band for people who earn over Â£150,000 a year has also been axed. The reduction in income tax, along with the reversal of the National Insurance rise, will see higher earners save more money. A person earning Â£20,000 a year will save Â£167, according to analysts at EY. Meanwhile, an individual with an income of Â£40,000 will save Â£617 and person with earnings of Â£60,000 will save Â£969. A person on Â£100,000 will get an extra Â£1,469. During his mini-budget, the chancellor said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"" and reduce incentives for new businesses, arguing that tax cuts are ""central to solving the riddle of growth"". Mr Kwarteng said scrapping the highest 45% tax rate would also ""reward enterprise and growth"". The policy change means people earning more than Â£150,000 a year will instead pay the tax rate of 40%, which is applicable to earnings of more than Â£50,270 a year. However, the change will not apply to Scotland where income tax bands are different. People in Scotland who earn more than Â£150,000 a year currently pay a 46% rate. The cut in basic rate tax to 19p in the pound also does not apply in Scotland. Rachel McEleney, associate tax director at consultancy firm Deloitte, said the majority of taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who currently pay the basic rate of 20%, will see ""some savings, albeit less"" from April. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the mini-budget prioritised big business over working people by relying on a theory of ""trickle down economics"". ""The prime minister and chancellor are like two desperate gamblers in a casino chasing a losing run,"" she said in response to Mr Kwarteng's plans. Households across the UK have been feeling the pinch of higher prices in recent months, with higher energy bills and rising food prices fuelling inflation to a 40-year high. The government has announced support to help with energy costs, limiting the typical household bill to Â£2,500 a year until 2024, but bills are still set to rise in October. What the mini-budget means for you At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity, said the government had chosen to ""turn its back on millions who are on the lowest incomes"". ""This is a budget that has wilfully ignored families struggling through a cost of living emergency and instead targeted its action at the richest,"" she said. ""Families on low incomes can't wait for the promised benefits of economic growth to trickle down into their pockets."" However, Mark Littlewood, director general at free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the axing of the highest rate of income tax would mean higher earners would spend ""more time boosting their own productivity"" ""The additional rate of income tax (45p) was always performative politics rather than sound economics,"" he said. ""The 1p off the basic rate of income tax will put more money in people's pockets."" The abolition of the highest tax band, which was introduced in 2010, came as a surprise to many economists. ""It really is that kind of rabbit out of the hat..that not only is the additional rate going to be completely abolished, but also the cuts to the basic rate of income tax are going to be brought forward a year,"" said Michael Brown, head of market intelligence at finance firm Caxton.

Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel dies aged 70,"Two of the three books in Dame Hilary's Wolf Hall trilogy won the Booker Prize Dame Hilary Mantel, author of the best-selling Wolf Hall trilogy, has died aged 70, her publisher has confirmed. She won the Booker Prize twice, for 2009's Wolf Hall, the first in the Thomas Cromwell series, and its 2012 sequel Bring Up the Bodies. In a statement,her publisher said:,external""We are heartbroken at the death of our beloved author, Dame Hilary Mantel. ""Our thoughts are with her friends and family, especially her husband, Gerald. ""This is a devastating loss and we can only be grateful she left us with such a magnificent body of work."" Authors Rowling and Mosse lead tributes to Mantel HarperCollins said Dame Hilary had died ""suddenly yet peacefully"" on Thursday, surrounded by family and friends, after suffering a stroke. Wolf Hall was a fictional account of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power in the court of Henry VIII. The third and final book in the series, The Mirror and the Light, waspublished in 2020 to much critical acclaim,became a fiction best-seller and was longlisted for The Booker Prize 2020. The trilogy sold more than five million copies globally and has been translated into 41 languages. This video can not be played Hilary Mantel tells Andrew Marr that modern politicians don't match up to Cromwell In an interview with The Guardian, Dame Hilary said it took years to research the books to ensure they were historically accurate portrayals. She said it was her aim to put the reader in ""that time and that place, putting you into Henry's entourage"". ""The essence of the thing is not to judge with hindsight, not to pass judgement from the lofty perch of the 21st Century when we know what happened,"" she said. ""It's to be there with them in that hunting party at Wolf Hall, moving forward with imperfect information and perhaps wrong expectations, but in any case moving forward into a future that is not pre-determined, but where chance and hazard will play a terrific role."" Harry Potter authorJK Rowling led the tributes,externalto Dame Hilary, writing: ""We've lost a genius."" Author and journalist Caitlin Moran tweeted:,external""Hilary Mantel's mind was one of the most powerful and magic machines on Earth. We were lucky she wrote as much as she did, but holy hell, it's devastating that we've collectively lost something so astonishing."" Dame Hilary was the first woman to receive the Booker Prize twice Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:,external""Such terribly sad news. It is impossible to overstate the significance of the literary legacy Hilary Mantel leaves behind. Her brilliant Wolf Hall trilogy was the crowning achievement in an outstanding body of work. Rest in peace."" Fellow Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo tweeted:,external""So very sorry to hear about Hilary Mantel's passing. We were so lucky to have such a massive talent in our midst. I met her a few times and she was always so warm, down-to-earth and welcoming."" Broadcaster Stig Abell added:,external""Hilary Mantel wrote historical novels that will be read for centuries to come. Brilliant, moving, fascinating, modern yet transporting. One of the greats. What a contribution to our national life and culture."" Allow Twitter content?

Bill Hamilton, Dame Hilary's agent at literary agency A M Heath, said it had been the ""greatest privilege"" to work with her. He said: ""Her wit, stylistic daring, creative ambition and phenomenal historical insight mark her out as one of the greatest novelists of our time. ""She will be remembered for her enormous generosity to other budding writers, her capacity to electrify a live audience, and the huge array of her journalism and criticism, producing some of the finest commentary on issues and books."" Born in Derbyshire in 1952, Dame Hilary studied Law at the London School of Economics and Sheffield University. She worked as a social worker and lived in Botswana and Saudi Arabia before returning to the UK in the mid-1980s. Dame Hilary pictured with Ben Miles, who co-wrote and starred in the stage adaptations of her work She married the geologist Gerald McEwan in 1972. The couple later divorced but remarried soon after. In 1987 she became the film critic of the Spectator magazine, and in her later career continued to review for a wide range of publications. By this point, she had begun to regularly win literary prizes and her fourth novel, Fludd, claimed the Cheltenham Festival Prize, the Southern Arts Literature Prize and the Winifred Holtby Prize. Her fifth novel, A Place Of Greater Safety, won the Sunday Express Book of the Year Award, while Beyond Black, published in 2005, was shortlisted for the Orange Prize. Once described as the best-kept secret in English fiction, she was an intense and troubling writer and her subjects were unpredictable - including performing psychics in Suburbia and the French Revolution. The publication of Wolf Hall in 2009 marked a significant turning point in her career, attracting rave reviews and ultimately winning the Booker Prize. Damian Lewis as Henry VIII (right) and Sir Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in the BBC TV adaptation of Wolf Hall Wolf Hall and its sequel Bring Up The Bodies were turned into a six-part BBC TV series starring Sir Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn. The two books were also adapted for the stage and enjoyed a run in London's West End, as did a 2021 adaptation of the third novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light. Actor and playwright Ben Miles, who helped Dame Hilary bring her work to the stage, described her as ""an extraordinary woman"", as well as ""a good friend and a close colleague"". ""I feel so honoured to have known her and to have contributed in a small way to the work of one of the greatest writers of our time,"" he told the BBC on Friday. ""I shall dearly miss her kindness, her humour and her gentle tenacity. The indisputable genius of her words remains as some small consolation to this tragic loss."" Dame Hilary wrote 17 books, including The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher, Vacant Possession and Every Day is Mother's Day, as well as the memoir Giving up the Ghost. In 2017,she delivered the Reith Lectures on BBC Radio 4,discussing the role that history plays in culture. Mantel was made a Dame in 2014 for services to literature She was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in In 1990 and was awarded a damehood in 2014 for services to literature. Throughout her life, Dame Hilary suffered from a severe form of endometriosis that took many years to diagnose. She required surgery, a surgical menopause in her late 20s, leaving her unable to have children, and she continued to need treatment all her life. Asked by the Financial Times,externalearlier this month whether she believed in an afterlife, Mantel said she did, but that she couldn't imagine how it might work. ""However, the universe is not limited by what I can imagine,"" she said.

Molly Russell's Insta viewing 'most distressing',"Molly Russell had opened a Twitter account that her parents only found out about after her death The inquest of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life has been examining the impact of material she viewed on Instagram in the run-up to her death. Molly Russell, from Harrow, north-west London, engaged with numerous accounts referring to self-harm, depression or suicide before killing herself in 2017. The court heard how the platform recommended further content based on those views. Elizabeth Lagone, from Meta, which owns Instagram, defended their policies. Ms Lagone, head of health and well-being at the social media giant formerly known as Facebook, told the North London Coroner's Court that suicide and self-harm material could have been posted by a user as a ""cry for help"". She said it was an important consideration of the company, even in its policies at the time of Molly's death, to ""consider the broad and unbelievable harm that can be done by silencing [an Instagram user's] struggles"". In her own words - Molly Russell's secret Twitter account Molly Russell's inquest to put focus on big tech Tech bosses ordered to appear at Molly Russell inquest Instagram's guidelines at the time, which were shown to the court, said users were allowed to post content about suicide and self-harm to ""facilitate the coming together to support"" other users but not if it ""encouraged or promoted"" this. Asked by the family's lawyer Oliver Sanders KC whether it was obvious it was not safe for children to see ""graphic suicide imagery"", the executive said: ""I don't knowâ¦ these are complicated issues."" Mr Sanders drew the witness's attention to experts who had informed Meta it was not safe for children to view such material, before asking: ""Had they previously told you something different?"" Ms Lagone responded: ""We have ongoing discussions with them but there are any number ofâ¦ issues we talk about with them."" Elizabeth Lagone, Meta's head of health and well-being gave evidence at North London Coroner's Court Earlier, the inquest was shown footage Molly had liked or saved. The court, sitting in Barnet, was warned by coroner Andrew Walker the footage was ""most distressing... it is almost impossible to watch"". Mr Walker told the inquest there had been a discussion about whether to edit the videos before they were played. He added: ""But Molly had no such choice, so we would in effect be editing the footage for adult viewing when it was available in an unedited form for a child."" On Thursday, Pinterest's head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, apologised after admitting the platform was ""not safe"" when the 14-year-old used it. Mr Hoffman said he ""deeply regrets"" posts viewed by Molly on the image-sharing site before her death, saying it was material he would ""not show to my children"".

'We'll be lucky to keep our heads above water',"The government has set out plans in a mini-budget designed to boost economic growth and tackle soaring inflation. These include cuts to stamp duty and income tax, reversing a recent rise in National Insurance, ending the cap on bankers' bonuses, and scrapping a planned increase in corporation tax. We asked households and businesses how the plans would make a difference to them. Raj Patel is very concerned about whether his restaurant business will survive Raj Patel, 65, is the owner of restaurant Vegetarian Food Studio in Grangetown, Cardiff. He says there is ""nothing for small business"" in the government plans. ""This budget is for the rich,"" he says. ""Everything is for the rich, not for the poor."" He says scrapping the planned rise in corporation tax would help big business, but not his restaurant. ""If you don't make a big profit, it's not going to make a difference."" Raj is due to sign a 10-year lease on his restaurant in December, but is wary of doing so because he doesn't know if he can pay the rent. His landlord could take him to court if that happened. Due to food, fuel and energy price rises, he recently put the prices in his restaurant up by Â£1 per dish. However, over two months, the amount of money the business took dropped by more than a third, and he is worried that this could get worse as people tighten their belts. ""We'll be lucky to keep our heads above water,"" he says. What the mini-budget means for you At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Hotel manager Wendy Timewell says the package from the government will help her business Wendy Timewell, manager at Hotel Wroxham in Hoveton, Norfolk, says the government plans ""will certainly help"". ""I think the government has done a good job,"" she says. The cut to National Insurance ""will help hugely"", both for the business, which since April had been having to make higher contributions, and for employees, who would get more take-home wages. In addition, government support on energy bills will help, although it is still unclear by exactly how much. Wendy says she is ""really grateful for all the things the government has done"", and that the support will help her cope with ""spiralling costs"", including food, energy and fuel. However, despite the hotel being in a strong position, she is still apprehensive about what will happen over the winter. ""We're going into the unknown,"" she says. ""We're not sure how [price rises] will affect the general public. It's terrifying."" One of the first ways people look to save money is by spending less on hospitality, she says. ""Only the strong will survive. The top earners will be fine."" However, businesses that had not been prudent or had been hit hard by the pandemic could go under, Wendy believes. Hospitality firms are ""still paying out huge amounts of Covid debt"", she says, while the government has started ""aggressively going after businesses for payment"". Chrissy Thornton says she can't see anything in the mini-budget that benefits her Chrissy Thornton runs the Disability Families of Middleton charity in Leeds on a voluntary basis and looks after her two grandchildren. She was hopeful the government would provide her with help in the mini-budget. But at home on Friday, she voiced her disappointment at the measures. Chrissy gets income support benefit, alongside disability living allowance and carer's allowance as her grandson has multiple conditions, including Raynaud Syndrome. She can't see anything in the announcement to benefit her. ""The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. People are struggling, it's getting worse,"" she says. ""My heart goes out to the elderly and vulnerable and those who are doing two jobs and still can't afford to provide for themselves."" Lesley, a nurse from Staffordshire, who didn't want to giver her surname, is in her 50s. She says the government plans ""don't feel like they're going to make a big difference"" to many people's lives. The cut to National Insurance will help, but many people will still be struggling, she says. She is particularly concerned about energy bills, saying she is ""worried about how much further it's going to go up"" in October, even with the government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme. ""My husband and I are already talking about how much of the winter we could manage without the heating on,"" she says. ""You don't think in this day and age you'd be saying: 'How many blankets do I need to put around my knees?'"" Lesley is worried about elderly relatives getting cold and about discharging elderly patients. ""It puts pressure on us as nurses,"" she says. ""If we discharge them, we think: 'Are they going to be sat at home, freezing cold?'"" Lesley's husband is disabled, and she is the main income-earner in her household. She is noticing higher food prices and has started shopping more at discounters. ""We're thinking: 'What do we really need?'"" she says. ""It's changed my shopping practices. I used to go out and not even look at the prices of things."" Lesley is also doing more batch cooking to try to save energy, and car-sharing with colleagues to get to work due to higher fuel prices.

Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?,"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

Will this huge tax cutting gamble pay off?,"It is an unofficial Budget of staggering size designed to jump start the economy. A Â£12bn corporation tax cut, a Â£17bn National Insurance cut, a Â£5bn basic rate income tax cut, and a Â£2bn cut to the 45p rate. Put together the biggest tax cutting moment for a half a century. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK government bonds in decades, with some of the biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, as it also sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. What the mini-budget means for you At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Pound sinks as investors question huge tax cuts The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. What's the plan? To increase the productivity of the economy and therefore growth over the long term and so tax revenue. The detail of that plan is not in today's announcement. A tax cut that could underpin such a plan is mainly what we got today, alongside some interesting economic reforms, for financial services and enterprise zones. Many of the most important economic policies that could help boost growth were left unmentioned. For example, the last time the Office for Budget Responsibility adjusted UK's long-term growth prospects, it was to cut them, in July, on account of Britain's shrinking workforce. Perhaps worker visas, skills, infrastructure, trade barriers for exporters to Europe will be addressed another time. All contain growth-enhancing policy areas that will test the limits of the PM's acceptance of doing unpopular things. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here. There are considerable risks in this plan, but the government has thrown the kitchen sink at it. It should help growth upfront. As global markets send the interest rates charged to the government rocketing, however, there is a risk that the economy is left in a couple of years having enjoyed a temporary stimulus, and a permanent hangover of high interest rates and high debts. As mortgage rates and commercial borrowing rises, there are risks in the housing market. So there are many gaps left to fill in this plan for growth. The government needs an aspiration to raise growth to become a reality. But the echoes of the last Budget of this size in 1972, which led to an infamous period of boom and bust under chancellor Anthony Barber, will not be comfortable.

Sign language campaigners take government to court,"Lynn Stewart-Taylor founded the Where Is The Interpreter campaign The government is being taken to court today by 276 deaf people over the lack of British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation at the televised coronavirus briefings. The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London will see a judge decide if the complainants are entitled to compensation. Campaigner Lynn Stewart-Taylor says the lack of provision during the pandemic made the deaf community feel ""excluded"" and ""like we're an afterthought."" The government says they ""established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel."" The case is being heard on Friday September 23 - which happens to be International Day of Sign Languages. A judicial review last year found that out of over 173 Covid briefings to the date of the review, two were unlawful because BSL was not provided on screen. But Ms Stewart-Taylor, who founded the campaign group #WhereIsTheInterpreter at the start of the pandemic, told theBBC's Access All podcastthat the first nine Covid briefings in March 2020 had no BSL interpreter present. Speaking through a BSL interpreter, she said that the deaf community did not initially know how serious the pandemic was - because they just weren't being told, which was ""terrifying"". Deaf woman wins Covid briefing sign language claim Call for Covid briefings to include sign language Students march for British Sign Language law change The remaining ministerial briefings had an on-screen interpreter superimposed on the screen which was available on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer and later on Government social media channels. But Ms Stewart-Lynn argues that this meant deaf people could only find out what was happening if they used the BBC. Ms Stewart-Taylor says it should not be up to individual broadcasters like the BBC to provide the service, but for the government to provide a BSL interpreter and in the room next to speakers so that the original live televised stream and all follow up news reports and clips will always have a signer present. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had in-person interpreters at their devolved briefings from the outset, and so circumnavigated the issue. In the latest episode of Access All, presenter Nikki Fox discusses the on-going BSL court case with campaigners Lynn and Liam. There is a full transcript available. We also hear from actor Leo Long, the star of the new Netflix film, I Used To Be Famous, on being neurodiverse and playing the role of an autistic drummer. Liam O'Dell, a deaf and disabled freelance journalist who has been following the case says: ""There's a real sense from the government that they're just not taking this seriously. ""Conferences are still happening where interpretation is not being provided there in person. But if it's in person you don't have to worry about it being just on a BBC channel, because it's accessible by default. ""A recent example is Liz Truss stood on the steps of Downing Street, making her first speech as Prime Minister and there was no BSL interpreter next to her. ""So there's a sense the Government still doesn't get it. It's not about the compensation, it's merely a more punitive measure to hit the Government a little bit financially and to say: 'Look, this is what will happen if you keep treating deaf people as second-class citizens.'"" Many deaf people who use BSL as their first language say they cannot rely on subtitles because for them, English is their second language and the average reading age for deaf people is often reported as being around nine years old. The issue has been rolling through the courts for some time. In a case from July 2021, a deaf woman won a claim against the government after a judge found a lack of sign language at two televised Covid briefings had ""served to disempower, to frustrate and to marginalise"". Katie Rowley, then 36, from Leeds, started court action after the events went ahead without interpreters on screen. The government denied breaching its legal obligation to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people. But in his ruling, a judge said the lack of provision constituted discrimination. Ms Rowley is one of the 276 deaf people bringing action against the government in this most recent court case. She uses BSL as her first language and is also dyslexic - making English language subtitles doubly difficult to read. ""I am a slow reader - so that means when I was reading the subtitles, I would miss so much information and [it] would just mess up my head. It would be so difficult - it became impossible,"" Ms Rowley previously told the BBC through an interpreter.

If the government is successful in today's hearing, the case will be struck out, although claimants will be able to appeal.

Pound sinks as markets react to mini-budget,"The pound has fallen to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as financial markets reacted to the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years. UK stocks also dropped after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a series of tax cuts and economic measures in a massive shake-up of the country's finances. The pound fell more than 3% against the dollar, dropping below $1.09. Sterling has fallen recently over worries about the economy and partly due to a stronger US dollar. The pound also fell more than 1% against the euro on Friday, dropping to â¬1.12. Mr Kwarteng refused to comment on the dropping value of the currency, saying he ""doesn't comment on market movements"". What the mini-budget means for you Why has the value of the pound tumbled? UK may already be in recession - Bank of England The cost of government borrowing soared following the announcement, rising by near-record amounts, as investors did the sums over the new strategy. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect UK interest rates to hit 5.2% in August 2023, with expectations rising that there could be a one percentage point interest rate hike at the Bank of England's next meeting in November. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economic think tank, said the market reaction was ""worrying"" as the government's new strategy relied on investors being willing to lend more to the UK. ""The plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. Mr Johnson said the new strategy would inject demand into a high inflation economy, risking further price rises. At the same time the Bank of England was pulling in the opposite direction, and was likely to raise interest rates even further in response to the Â£45bn tax reduction. The Bank of England needs to make an emergency, unscheduled rate hike as soon as next week ""to regain credibility with the market"", said Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos. He said that move would also send a strong signal that the bank is ""willing to do 'whatever it takes' to bring inflation down quickly"". Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers warned the pound could fall below the dollar due to the huge spending commitments outlined by Mr Kwarteng. ""It makes me very sorry to say, but I think the UK is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market,"" Mr Summers told Bloomberg. ""Between Brexit, how far the Bank of England got behind the curve and now these fiscal policies, I think Britain will be remembered for having pursuing the worst macroeconomic policies of any major country in a long time."" Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said the sell-off of sterling showed investors have doubts about the government's plans. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded. That will result in a large amount of debt at a time when the Bank of England is going to be selling some of its holdings of UK government debt,"" she said. ""I think this government does need to provide a lot more reassurance that it does have fiscal sensibility in order. This is not the message that's come across this morning."" The UK's FTSE 100 index of major shares fell more than 2%, dropping to its lowest level for more than two months, reflecting concerns that the plan to stimulate growth might not pay off. The plan also contributed to a sell-off in US markets, where the three main share indexes fell more than 2%. ""Ultimately, the growth dice have been rolled. But it is too early to know if the gamble will succeed and boost confidence enough to encourage businesses and people to spend and invest, stimulating the UK economy,"" said Karen Campbell-Williams, head of tax at Grant Thornton. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK said there was likely to be a boost to the economy of ""roughly 1%"" over the next year, reducing the risk of a longer recession, but that the longer term outlook was less positive. ""There was nothing in the budget that makes us more optimistic about the long-term growth trend of the economy. Trend growth is currently probably half of the 2.5% the Chancellor has set as his new target,"" he said. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK Government bonds in decades, with some of biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, but it sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here.

Sign language campaigners take Government to court,"Lynn Stewart-Taylor founded the Where Is The Interpreter campaign The government is being taken to court today by 276 deaf people over the lack of British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation at the televised coronavirus briefings. The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London will see a judge decide if the complainants are entitled to compensation. Campaigner Lynn Stewart-Taylor says the lack of provision during the pandemic made the deaf community feel ""excluded"" and ""like we're an afterthought."" The government says they ""established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel."" The case is being heard on Friday September 23 - which happens to be International Day of Sign Languages. A judicial review last year found that out of over 173 Covid briefings to the date of the review, two were unlawful because BSL was not provided on screen. But Ms Stewart-Taylor, who founded the campaign group #WhereIsTheInterpreter at the start of the pandemic, told theBBC's Access All podcastthat the first nine Covid briefings in March 2020 had no BSL interpreter present. Speaking through a BSL interpreter, she said that the deaf community did not initially know how serious the pandemic was - because they just weren't being told, which was ""terrifying"". Deaf woman wins Covid briefing sign language claim Call for Covid briefings to include sign language Students march for British Sign Language law change The remaining ministerial briefings had an on-screen interpreter superimposed on the screen which was available on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer and later on Government social media channels. But Ms Stewart-Lynn argues that this meant deaf people could only find out what was happening if they used the BBC. Ms Stewart-Taylor says it should not be up to individual broadcasters like the BBC to provide the service, but for the government to provide a BSL interpreter and in the room next to speakers so that the original live televised stream and all follow up news reports and clips will always have a signer present. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had in-person interpreters at their devolved briefings from the outset, and so circumnavigated the issue. In the latest episode of Access All, presenter Nikki Fox discusses the on-going BSL court case with campaigners Lynn and Liam. There is a full transcript available. We also hear from actor Leo Long, the star of the new Netflix film, I Used To Be Famous, on being neurodiverse and playing the role of an autistic drummer. Liam O'Dell, a deaf and disabled freelance journalist who has been following the case says: ""There's a real sense from the government that they're just not taking this seriously. ""Conferences are still happening where interpretation is not being provided there in person. But if it's in person you don't have to worry about it being just on a BBC channel, because it's accessible by default. ""A recent example is Liz Truss stood on the steps of Downing Street, making her first speech as Prime Minister and there was no BSL interpreter next to her. ""So there's a sense the Government still doesn't get it. It's not about the compensation, it's merely a more punitive measure to hit the Government a little bit financially and to say: 'Look, this is what will happen if you keep treating deaf people as second-class citizens.'"" Many deaf people who use BSL as their first language say they cannot rely on subtitles because for them, English is their second language and the average reading age for deaf people is often reported as being around nine years old. The issue has been rolling through the courts for some time. In a case from July 2021, a deaf woman won a claim against the government after a judge found a lack of sign language at two televised Covid briefings had ""served to disempower, to frustrate and to marginalise"". Katie Rowley, then 36, from Leeds, started court action after the events went ahead without interpreters on screen. The government denied breaching its legal obligation to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people. But in his ruling, a judge said the lack of provision constituted discrimination. Ms Rowley is one of the 276 deaf people bringing action against the government in this most recent court case. She uses BSL as her first language and is also dyslexic - making English language subtitles doubly difficult to read. ""I am a slow reader - so that means when I was reading the subtitles, I would miss so much information and [it] would just mess up my head. It would be so difficult - it became impossible,"" Ms Rowley previously told the BBC through an interpreter. A government spokesman says: ""We are committed to supporting disabled people and established BSL interpretation at the No10 Covid press conferences via the BBC News channel and iPlayer, available on all TV packages as part of Freeview."" If the government is successful in today's hearing, the case will be struck out, although claimants will be able to appeal. If the campaigners are successful, the case could end up going to full trial. If the judge rules in their favour, it will then be decided later how much compensation to award. ""We're in 2022, and we expect to be part of that wider community,"" says Ms Stewart-Taylor. ""To be accepted for the language we use, the culture we have, and so [this case] is about recognising us as a part of the wider community.""

"Kwarteng admits Tory economic failure, says Labour","This video can not be played Watch: Labour thank Kwarteng for ""demolition"" of Tory record Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget of sweeping tax cuts would ""reward the already wealthy"" and not boost economic growth, Labour has said. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the plan was a Tory ""admission of 12 years of economic failure"". The measures were funded by unnecessary borrowing instead of a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, she added. Mr Kwarteng spent billions on policies he said would shake up the UK's finances and boost economic growth. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Kwarteng abolished the top rate of income tax for the highest earners as he unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts for decades. Live updates: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? What are the new stamp duty rates? His announcements included scrapping a cap on bankers' bonuses, reversing a rise in National Insurance and cutting stamp duty tax - a property purchasing tax - for some buyers. The Institute of Fiscal Studies said,externalthe richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng's measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by his predecessor, Rishi Sunak. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said those earning Â£1m annually will get a Â£55,000 tax cut next year. As the UK faces a recession, rising interest rates and soaring energy bills, Ms Reeves said ""the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis"". But Mr Kwarteng argued his economic vision will ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". The Liberal Democrats said the chancellor's plan was ""a recipe for disaster that will leave families suffering from soaring prices while banks and oil and gas companies rake in huge profits"". The Scottish National Party said the Tory government was ""robbing the poor to pay the rich"" and its measures do not go far enough to help people on low incomes. Mr Kwarteng told MPs he was fulfilling new Prime Minister Liz Truss's promise to run a ""tax-cutting government"". ""For too long in this country, we have indulged in a fight over redistribution. Now, we need to focus on growth, not just how we tax and spend,"" he said in his statement. In her response, Ms Reeves congratulated the chancellor ""on his comprehensive demolition"" of the Conservative government's record of the past 12 years. ""Their record, their failure, their vicious circle of stagnation,"" she added. Ms Reeves said borrowing was higher than it needed to be after the Bank of England raised interest rates andwarned the UK may already be in recession. ""This is casino economics - gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country to keep the Tory party happy,"" Ms Reeves said. Mr Kwarteng said tax cuts are ""central to solving the riddle of growth"" She criticised the chancellor for refusing to release an independent forecast of how his tax changes would impact the economy, as the government usually does when it delivers major financial statements. But because Mr Kwarteng's statement was not technically a budget, he said he would release this forecast ""in due course"" before the end of the year. Ms Reeves said without this forecast, the chancellor's statement was ""a budget without figures, a menu without prices"", asking what he had to hide. She referenceda tweet by US President Joe Biden,external, saying he was right to be ""sick and tired"" of ""tickle-down economics"", which was a ""discredited"" theory that would not ""unleash the wave of investment that we need"". She said: ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today - not a plan for growth, a plan to reward the already wealthy. ""A return to the trickle-down of the past, back to the future, not a brave new era."" Income tax to be cut by 1p from April What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

Hong Kong to end Covid hotel quarantine policy,"Hong Kong's border policies have hit its economy hard Hong Kong's government says that from Monday people arriving in Hong Kong will no longer have to go into mandatory hotel quarantine. Travellers will also no longer have to show a negative Covid test before boarding a plane to Hong Kong. Instead they will monitor themselves for possible infection for three days. The news sparked a rush for flight tickets to Hong Kong, with the Cathay Pacific website operating a queuing system to book. The airline said it was adding more than 200 pairs of flights in October to both regional and long haul destinations. ""While we will continue to add back more flights as quickly as is feasible, it will take time to rebuild our capacity gradually,"" a statement said. Hong Kong has had some of the world's toughest rules as it follows China's zero Covid policies. So its departure from what the mainland is doing is a long-awaited decision. Restrictions on people arriving have been in place for more than two years. And there are still rules in place for travellers. They cannot enter common areas such as restaurants or shopping malls for the first three days after arrival. They also have to undergo PCR tests on day two, four six. The prolonged closure of border has however hit Hong Kong's economy hard and left the Asian financial centre at a disadvantage compared with its rivals in the region such as Singapore. Singapore has now unseated the city as Asia's top financial market in the Global Financial Centres Index. ""Hong Kong has been isolated from the international community for two-and-half years, and is suffering from it,"" Hao Hong, chief economist of Grow Investment Group told the BBC. ""While the end to hotel quarantine is a step forward, rebuilding confidence takes time, especially against the tide of exodus of talents from Hong Kong."" ""The easing of travel arrangements will re-establish the level playing field in terms of competing with other cities on connectivity,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia Pacific economist of S&P Global Ratings. ""The fact that Hong Kong can move on this even as mainland China keeps its Covid stance largely unchanged for now strengthens the case for the 'two systems' part of the 'one-country, two systems' arrangement that gives Hong Kong its special status within China. ""The city should be able to leverage that role in the coming years, including via the Greater Bay Area initiative."" Earlier on FridayJapan announced that it was relaxing entry rules, with tourists able to visit without a visa and without needing to go through a travel agency from 11 October. A cap on daily arrivals will also be lifted.

Speeding councillor hit police car after bingo,"Tom Hollis was told he will be sentenced on 13 October A councillor drove at high speed through a 30mph zone before reversing into a police car, a court heard. Tom Hollis, deputy leader of Ashfield District Council in Nottinghamshire, was spotted by officers while on his way home from bingo in September 2020. On Friday he was found guilty of driving without care and attention. The verdict comes a day after Holliswas convicted of harassing neighbourswho had accused him of holding hot tub meetings during a Covid lockdown. Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard Hollis had been returning home from bingo in a Range Rover when two police officers in an unmarked vehicle spotted the defendant travelling at high speed along Outram Street in Sutton-in-Ashfield. The officers made up ground to follow the defendant, with the court hearing the officers were driving at 70mph. Turning their blue lights on, police continued to follow Hollis at speed along Northern Bridge Road to an Asda petrol station forecourt in Priestsic Road. James Gregory, who was filling up his car on the forecourt, said the Range Rover ""swung"" onto the forecourt and he ""had to take a step back"" as he thought he would be hit. He told the court the manner of Hollis's driving left him ""shocked and frightened"". ""It didn't appear to slow down â¦ it looked like a full-blown police chase,"" said Mr Gregory. The court heard Hollis then reversed at ""five miles per hour"" into a police car that parked up behind him on the forecourt. This was accepted to be an accident. Summing up the case, District Judge Grace Leong, said Hollis claimed he was ""not in a hurry"" and it was a ""leisurely drive home"". Hollis said in cross-examination he had been driving at 30mph, but this version was rejected by the judge. The defendant also claimed he had not realised the blue lights were for him but Ms Leong said this was ""utterly implausible"" and he would have seen the lights well before he got to the petrol station. ""Mr Hollis, was very lucky not to be prosecuted for dangerous driving, travelling 60 to 70mph in an area which has traffic calming measures,"" the judge said. On Thursday, Hollis was convicted at the same court of of two counts of harassment against his neighbours. The court heard he had concocted a false knife threat allegation and sent a threatening letter on council-headed paper after they told police he had been hosting meetings in his hot tub. The district judge found him guilty of both charges but also concluded the deputy leader did not hold council meetings in the hot tub during the Covid pandemic.

"Bosses think workers do less from home, says Microsoft","Microsoft boss Satya Nadella told the BBC that workplaces need to overcome ""productivity paranoia"" A major new survey from Microsoft shows that bosses and workers fundamentally disagree about productivity when working from home. Bosses worry about whether working from home is as productive as being in the office. While 87% of workers felt they worked as, or more, efficiently from home, 80% of managers disagreed. The survey questioned more than 20,000 staff across 11 countries. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told the BBC this tension needed to be resolved as workplaces were unlikely to ever return to pre-pandemic work habits. ""We have to get past what we describe as 'productivity paranoia', because all of the data we have that shows that 80% plus of the individual people feel they're very productive - except their management thinks that they're not productive. ""That means there is a real disconnect in terms of the expectations and what they feel."" Both Mr Nadella and Ryan Roslansky, the boss of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, said employers were grappling with perhaps the biggest shift in working patterns in history. The number of fully-remote jobs advertised on LinkedIn soared during the pandemic but Mr Roslansky said data suggested that type of role might have peaked. He told the BBC that of some 14 or 15 million job listings that are typically live on LinkedIn, about 2% of those involved remote working before the pandemic. Some months ago, that stood at 20%, and it has since come down to 15% this month. Work from home for 20% less pay, says city law firm Elon Musk declares end to remote working at Tesla At a time of acute labour shortages, employers are having to work harder to recruit, enthuse and retain staff. That even includes Microsoft itself, according to Mr Nadella. ""We had 70,000 people who joined Microsoft during the pandemic, they sort of saw Microsoft through the lens of the pandemic. And now when we think about the next phase, you need to re-energize them, re-recruit them, help them form social connections."" Microsoft employees can work from home up to 50% of the time as standard. More than that requires management approval or a move to part-time working. Some companies have struggled to impose new working arrangements and expectations. There has been resistance to calls at Apple to return to the office three days a week from September, while Tesla boss Elon Musk has demanded 40 hours a week in the office sending an email saying: ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned."" An unprecedented number of people have also changed jobs since the start of the pandemic. A phenomenon Microsoft has dubbed ""the great reshuffle"", sees workers born after 1997 (so-called Generation Z) nearly twice as likely to switch jobs. ""At the peak of our 'great reshuffle' we saw a year-on-year increase of 50% of LinkedIn members changing jobs. Gen Z was at 90%,"" the report said. By 2030, Generation Z will make up about 30% of the entire workforce so managers need to understand them, according to LinkedIn's boss. As you might expect, alongside its new observations Microsoft has new products aimed at easing this potential mismatch in expectations. It is focusing on helping companies' younger workers feel a sense of belonging to, and an ability to learn in, an organisation in the way staff did in the past. Its new Viva software, for example, allows direct contact to senior managers, online teaching and a channel to share personal photos - somewhat like a company intranet site with bells on to ring in a new world of work, which employers in particular are struggling to navigate.

Parents having tough talks with kids as bills rise,"Lauren has had to have tough conversations with Ruben, 10, and Oliver, seven, over attending sports matches A mother has said she has had ""heart-breaking"" talks with her young children as the family struggle with the cost of living. Lauren and her husband said the cost of fuel meant they could no longer take their son to his football matches. The business owner said she was worried about energy costs and the impact on her staff this winter. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng hasannounced plans to grow the economyin a mini-budget. Ahead of Friday's announcement, the Welsh government had said the UK government needed to show ""they genuinely understand the real challenges faced by people, businesses and our public services"". Lauren set up Zero Waste Torfaen in Cwmbran a year ago having sold from home for two years. Charities face difficult winter amid crisis Longer-term support for businesses urged Her aim is to make her goods affordable to typical households, while her husband Daniel is a scientist and now a lecturer. She said with both of them working they should be okay, adding: ""Daniel studied for a long, long time to get the job he's got, we shouldn't be struggling."" Many goods are now more expensive Lauren said even with the new price cap from October, the couple would be paying double for gas and electricity compared to a year ago. ""We are bringing in enough, we shouldn't be worrying about taking Oliver to his football match on the weekend. I can only imagine how other people are coping,"" she added. The couple cut back on using their car when fuel rose to Â£2 a litre. ""We were looking at the boys' rugby and football matches and if they were a good drive away, some of them were over Â£20 to get there and back,"" she said. ""We had to pull out of some of the matches. ""Oliver loves sport, he wants to be out playing and to have to say 'I'm sorry we can't afford to pay to get there' is heart-breaking."" Lauren has been trying ways to save money in work and at home They have also tried ways of using less energy at home by cooking large amounts at a time, freezing it in batches and reheating it in the microwave. One of her customers Luke Durham, 36, said even though he has a good job as a salesman in a tile company, he and his family are being careful with their money. He said they are doing ""intelligent shopping"" like multiple deals and the children understand that lights need to be switched off if no-one is in the room. ""It's turning things off at the plug rather than the remote control,"" he added. Luke Durham says he feels under pressure from rising costs Looking ahead to the next 12 months, he said: ""It's very scary, and it's hitting work and the house, so you don't get any reprieve from it, that pressure on all the time from both sides, it's definitely very much in your face."" The UK government announced tax cuts, higher levels of public borrowing and a reduction of regulationsin the mini-budgeton Friday. Changes include reversing the increases in National Insurance payments for both employees and employers. The UK government claimed about 28 million people across the UK will save on average Â£330 of tax next year as a result. The chancellor said: ""Taxing our way to prosperity has never worked. To raise living standards for all, we need to be unapologetic about growing our economy. ""Cutting tax is crucial to this - and whether businesses reinvest freed-up cash into new machinery, lower prices on shop floors or increased staff wages, the reversal of the levy will help them grow, whilst also allowing the British public to keep more of what they earn."" Toilet roll is 25% more expensive Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said: ""There has been public support for tax increases to support social care but National Insurance isn't the only option on the table."" She added it would be fairer to tax wealth, through capital gains tax, at the same level as income tax and use that ""to give our vital public services the revenue they need not only to survive but thrive"". The Welsh government said it wanted the UK government to ""target support to people who need help the most"". In her shop, Lauren has already seen that customers are buying less as prices have risen. Lauren said she didn't want to see her staff struggling The prices she has to pay wholesalers have risen by 50% in the last year and toilet rolls by 25%. She said her margins are tight but ""the community knows us, they know that we are doing our best, they know we are not putting up prices because we want to make as much money as we can, we are here for the community and I'm hopeful people will understand the reasons"". She does not think that a cut in National Insurance or reductions in income tax will help her business and believes any tax reductions for customers will just go to pay their energy bills and not be spent in shops . Lauren had been planning to expand her range of foods to frozen ones but has now decided to put that on hold. She said that high energy prices made her worried about the cost of running a freezer in the shop.

Pound sinks as markets react,"The pound has fallen to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar as financial markets reacted to the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years. UK stocks also dropped after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a series of tax cuts and economic measures in a massive shake-up of the country's finances. The pound fell more than 3% against the dollar, dropping below $1.09. Sterling has fallen recently over worries about the economy and partly due to a stronger US dollar. The pound also fell more than 1% against the euro on Friday, dropping to â¬1.12. Mr Kwarteng refused to comment on the dropping value of the currency, saying he ""doesn't comment on market movements"". What the mini-budget means for you Why has the value of the pound tumbled? UK may already be in recession - Bank of England The cost of government borrowing soared following the announcement, rising by near-record amounts, as investors did the sums over the new strategy. According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect UK interest rates to hit 5.2% in August 2023, with expectations rising that there could be a one percentage point interest rate hike at the Bank of England's next meeting in November. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economic think tank, said the market reaction was ""worrying"" as the government's new strategy relied on investors being willing to lend more to the UK. ""The plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates, put government debt on an unsustainable rising path, and hope that we get better growth,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. Mr Johnson said the new strategy would inject demand into a high inflation economy, risking further price rises. At the same time the Bank of England was pulling in the opposite direction, and was likely to raise interest rates even further in response to the Â£45bn tax reduction. The Bank of England needs to make an emergency, unscheduled rate hike as soon as next week ""to regain credibility with the market"", said Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos. He said that move would also send a strong signal that the bank is ""willing to do 'whatever it takes' to bring inflation down quickly"". Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers warned the pound could fall below the dollar due to the huge spending commitments outlined by Mr Kwarteng. ""It makes me very sorry to say, but I think the UK is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market,"" Mr Summers told Bloomberg. ""Between Brexit, how far the Bank of England got behind the curve and now these fiscal policies, I think Britain will be remembered for having pursuing the worst macroeconomic policies of any major country in a long time."" Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said the sell-off of sterling showed investors have doubts about the government's plans. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded. That will result in a large amount of debt at a time when the Bank of England is going to be selling some of its holdings of UK government debt,"" she said. ""I think this government does need to provide a lot more reassurance that it does have fiscal sensibility in order. This is not the message that's come across this morning."" The UK's FTSE 100 index of major shares fell more than 2%, dropping to its lowest level for more than two months, reflecting concerns that the plan to stimulate growth might not pay off. The plan also contributed to a sell-off in US markets, where the three main share indexes fell more than 2%. ""Ultimately, the growth dice have been rolled. But it is too early to know if the gamble will succeed and boost confidence enough to encourage businesses and people to spend and invest, stimulating the UK economy,"" said Karen Campbell-Williams, head of tax at Grant Thornton. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK said there was likely to be a boost to the economy of ""roughly 1%"" over the next year, reducing the risk of a longer recession, but that the longer term outlook was less positive. ""There was nothing in the budget that makes us more optimistic about the long-term growth trend of the economy. Trend growth is currently probably half of the 2.5% the Chancellor has set as his new target,"" he said. And while it should initially soothe some of the recession we are already likely in, the similarly huge borrowing has sent markets reeling. It has been one of the worst days for UK Government bonds in decades, with some of biggest one-day hikes in the cost of borrowing since the 1990s. This has consequences not just for government, but it sets the basis for long-term borrowing rates for companies and householders. The lack of numbers, visibility, and quantifiable commitment to reining in government borrowing has added to uncertainty in markets. The government had to tell the markets that it needed to borrow an extra Â£72bn this year, but did not publish the numbers behind that. Interest rates charged for British debt hit 4%, having been 3.1% earlier this week, and 1.8% at the beginning of the leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. The Treasury's answer to all this is a table of forecasts which shows how much tax revenue would be raised if its reforms were able to permanently raise growth in the economy. But that table, while an aspiration that every chancellor and every politician seeks, has not convinced the markets. It is an assumption of extra tax revenue that has replaced actual tax. The prime minister criticised bean counters in her leadership campaign. Today's plan only shows one side of the ledger. For a chancellor making a debut, it is usual to focus on fiscal credibility. That was not the priority here.

Stamp duty cut in bid to help house buyers,"The government has announced a cut to stamp duty, the tax paid when people buy a property in England and Northern Ireland. The threshold at which the tax falls due has been raised to Â£250,000 from its current Â£125,000 level. Meanwhile the threshold for first-time buyers has been increased from Â£300,000 to Â£425,000. The changes should remove 200,000 people from having to pay stamp duty, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said. The chancellor also increased the value of the property on which first-time buyers can claim stamp duty relief from Â£500,000 to Â£625,000. A buyer splashing out Â£500,000 on a home will now be charged Â£12,500 rather than the previous Â£15,000. What are the new stamp duty rates? What the mini-budget means for you ""Home ownership is the most common route for people to own an asset, giving them a stake in the success of our economy and society,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Commons as he presented his mini-budget. ""This is a permanent cut to stamp duty, effective from today."" Different rates apply in Scotland under the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, and in Wales with the Land Transaction Tax. Under the changes announced by the chancellor, anyone spending Â£250,000 on a property in England or Northern Ireland will avoid Â£2,500 in stamp duty charges as it was previously charged at 2% between Â£125,000 and Â£250,000. Anyone other than first-time buyers spending Â£300,000 will now be charged Â£2,500, rather than the previous Â£5,000. However, some first-time buyers said the increase in the stamp duty threshold would not help. Sarah Johnson, 26, is a hairdresser in Chester who has managed to save Â£8,000 in five years towards buying a first home. But the cut in stamp duty won't help her as she would not have paid any anyway. Instead she is worried it will just push up house prices even more. ""[House prices] are just crazy at the moment and I think this is just going to make them more ridiculous,"" she says. ""I'm just trying to ignore it at the moment and hoping everything will crash and the prices will go down. ""When my mum bought her first house she says it was Â£50,000. I wish it was like that now because I could buy a house tomorrow!"" However, London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said: ""The stamp duty cut should encourage those at the first rung of the housing ladder to take the plunge. He said that would be good not just for the market but for job and social mobility across the board, as well as the wider economy. But rising interest rates, which will mean more costly mortgages, are set to weigh on the housing market, said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank. ""Many buyers will find the impact of rising mortgage rates soon eclipses the benefit of a stamp duty cut, which will keep firm downwards pressure on prices next year.""

"Study finds Cambridge 'benefitted from slavery'A report commissioned by vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, prompts a raft of recommendations.","The study found the university received money from benefactors in the slave trade The University of Cambridge received ""significant benefits"" from slavery, a report has found. The study was carried out by the Legacies of Enslavement Advisory Group, appointed in 2019 by the university's vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope. It found the university and its colleges benefited from companies and individuals participating in the trade. Prof Toope said it was ""inevitable"" a university ""as long-established as Cambridge"" would have links to slavery. Researchers found that fellows from Cambridge colleges were involved with the East India Company, while investors in the Royal African Company also had links to Cambridge, with both companies active in the slave trade. The university also received donations from investors in both companies, and directly invested in another company active in the slave trade, the South Sea Company, the study revealed. ""Such financial involvement both helped to facilitate the slave trade and brought very significant financial benefits to Cambridge,"" the Legacies of Enslavement report said. Collection changes name to promote women artists Turing sculpture for former college approved Cambridge college returns looted bronze cockerel Following its investigation, the group has made a series of recommendations, which the university said it would implement. These include setting up a dedicated slavery research centre, and enhancing existing academic links with universities in the Caribbean and West Africa. It will also look at increasing the number of postgraduate scholarships and bursaries for black British students and students from Africa and the Caribbean, as well as commissioning a piece of art commemorating the achievements of black academics in the university. The vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Prof Stephen Toope, commissioned the study in 2019 Prof Toope said slavery was ""until the 19th century, a widely accepted system of exploitation"". He said the report ""helps us better appreciate the nature"" of the university's links to slavery. ""It also offers a glimpse into some of the ways in which, as a provider of education, the university played a role in promoting some of the ideas that underpinned the practice of enslavement,"" he said.

Will Truss's plans make us richer?,"With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Liz Truss has faced an unprecedented challenge in her first month in the job. Just as testing will be her pledge for a ""bold plan to grow the economy"". On Friday, the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will outline a mini-Budget to deliver promises made by Ms Truss during her Tory leadership campaign to cut taxes. The mini-Budget is expected to reverse a 1.25% rise in National Insurance and scrap a 6% increase in corporation tax at a cost of Â£30bn. A cut in the basic rate of income tax may, it's reported, be on the cards. The announcement comes at a crucial time. Living standards are dropping at their fastest rate in decades and a recession may be imminent. And on average, we have been underperforming against major economies over the past 15 years, while income inequality has widened. All prime ministers promise to make us better off, but they differ in how they intend to do it. Ms Truss's pitch echoes the small state mantra of those on the right of her party: ""Cut taxes to reward hard work and boost business-led growth and investment."" The theory is that by allowing businesses and workers to retain more cash, they should spend and invest more which, in turn, should bring in more tax revenue. Cut red tape, and they have the freedom and incentive to do even more - what's termed supply-side reforms. One of the chancellor's first moves was tosack the Treasury's top senior servant, Tom Scholar, who helped mastermind the UK's response to the 2008 financial crisis. It sent a stark message; Kwasi Kwarteng and his boss are plotting a new course, doing things differently. But they'll face challenges. Cost of living calendar: The price hikes that lie ahead What is the UK inflation rate and why is the cost of living rising? Mr Kwarteng is said to want the UK economy to grow by 2.5% per year on average. That scale of growth has eluded many chancellors, whatever they've wished for, particularly since the financial crisis. Cutting taxes marks a definitive break from the Conservative's austerity era. But many economists query if that will substantially revive growth. Analysts at Oxford Economics, using a model that mimics that of the Treasury, say that they would add just 0.1% to the level of output of GDP by 2025. History says tax cuts rarely pay for themselves. They could, however, risk inflation - and so perhaps interest rates - staying higher for longer. Kwasi Kwarteng supported Liz Truss's Tory leadership bid Moreover, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that those on the highest incomes will receive more than 200 times as much from these tax cuts as those on the lowest. Ms Truss claims that it is fair and that everyone will ultimately benefit via higher growth - which is a move back to the ""trickle-down"" economics approach embraced by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, and away from the redistributive approach of the past couple of decades. ""Trickle-down"" may be the new ""levelling-up"" (a Boris Johnson-esque phrase absent so far) but it is questionable, on past experience, whether it will work. And rising income inequality could pose electoral challenges. One think tank claims those on the lowest incomes in the UK are around a fifth worse off than their French counterparts. Slashing red tape, meanwhile, is a more familiar refrain but there are questions about what might be feasible or desirable. Brexit allows the UK to diverge from the rules it had for financial services whilst in the European Union. But the Treasury Select Committee has warned against excessive deregulation. It claims that many rules imposed in the wake of the financial crisis worked to increase confidence in Britain's financial sector. One such measure introduced during this period to deter excessive risk-taking was the cap on bankers' bonuses, a limit the chancellor is reported to be looking to scrap. But what most economists do agree on is that underinvestment has been holding the UK back, making us a less efficient nation and restraining wage growth. However, many say lowering taxes and red tape may not be a silver bullet. Some, including Karen Ward, who was adviser to Philip Hammond when he was Chancellor, says the decline in investment became particularly marked from the time of the 2016 referendum as businesses waited to see how Brexit panned out. The International Monetary Fund is among those saying that ending the current dispute with the EU over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland could help revive investment by removing uncertainty. But the prime minister has made no mention ofthe Northern Ireland Protocoland that continued stand-off with the EU could ultimately risk not just underinvestment but a trade war. Even with a boost to investment, supply side reforms can take years to turbocharge growth. Ms Truss's stance reflects a belief of allowing markets to work freely. But ironically, it's the free workings of energy markets that's already prompted a change of plans as soon as she took office, a support package that signifies state intervention on what could be an unprecedented scale. The plan to curb future spikes in energy bills will deflect much of the additional looming pressure on households and businesses - and prevent inflation accelerating much further. But, the Bank of England suggests, it's too late to avoid a recession, although its length and depth could be less severe. The package also risks adding even more to the government's debt than the furlough scheme. As it is, higher inflation already risks the interest payments on that debt exceeding Â£100bn next year. Concerns about even higher debt has prompted the interest rate the government pays for new borrowing to hit a decade-high on financial markets. This package doesn't mean Liz Truss has abandoned her smaller state vision. Instead - like Rishi Sunak when he became Chancellor at the start of the pandemic - circumstances prevailed, and she sees this energy crisis as an exception. But she may yet face pressure to pump more money into the state. Schools and hospitals aren't immune to recent inflation. They'll need billions of pounds more simply to fulfil existing plans. Ms Truss's strategy is indeed different - through design and necessity. But will it pay off? The value of the pound has recently fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in almost four decades. Markets, already nervous about the UK's prospects, reckon her approach is a gamble. Friday's tax cuts will boost many fortunes in the short run - but we won't know for some time if our longer-term prospects have improved.

Truss defends bankers bonus plans,"This video can not be played Liz Truss: ""I will always work to make sure we are helping those who are struggling."" Prime Minister Liz Truss has said she is prepared to take ""difficult decisions"" such as removing a cap on bankers' bonuses to boost the economy. In an interview with the BBC, Ms Truss said that spurring economic growth may mean doing unpopular things. Her government is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Speaking in New York ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden, the PM said she was about ""delivering for people"". BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asked Ms Truss whether she was happy to see bankers getting bigger bonuses and for the rich to get richer. ""What I want to see is a growing economy,"" Ms Truss said. ""If that means taking difficult decisions which are going to help Britain become more competitive, help Britain become more attractive, help more investment flow into our country, yes, I'm absolutely prepared to make those decisions."" Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Funeral honours Queen's 'lifelong sense of duty' Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said there was nothing difficult about lifting the cap on bankers' bonuses. ""This is a bizarre move that will do nothing to support growth, and comes straight from the tired Tory playbook on trickle-down economics which haven't worked for them over the last decade,"" the Labour MP said. President Biden tweeted earlier that he was ""sick and tired"" of the theory that cutting taxes for business and the wealthy would see the benefits ""trickle down"" into the pockets of poorer workers. Although apparently not intended as a swipe at Ms Truss, the comment underlines the political differences between the two leaders ahead of their meeting. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest President Biden was referring to Ms Truss in the tweet. He said the world's democracies were ""not prescriptive"" in how they achieve economic growth. Ms Truss hasadmitted a new trade deal with the United Statesis unlikely in the ""short-to-medium term"" and that no discussions are currently underway. The UK government had previously promised a post-Brexit trade deal with the US by 2022. There has been lots of talk of a new era in the last few weeks, for obvious reasons. Now, with political argument returning, it is language the prime minister is embracing, about her premiership and the challenges she - we - face. 'We are entering a new era. It is a more insecure era,' she told me. Insecure abroad, insecure at home. The core of her political strategy is turbo-charging economic growth â and, for now at least, being willing to embrace the unpopular. ""Difficult decisions"" as she put it - such as allowing bankers to get bigger bonuses. There are two big questions for her: will it work, and will people like it? She doesn't have long to find out the answers, with a general election two-ish years away. In her Chris Mason interview, Ms Truss said she wanted to forge closer ties with the UK's allies. ""It is a more insecure era. We face an increasingly aggressive Russia, an assertive China. We need to work more closely with our allies, and we also need to get the British economy growing so that we have that security for all of our citizens."" In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in New York, Ms Truss agreed to enhance UK-France co-operation on energy to cut costs for households. In Downing Street's account of the meeting, there was no mention of contentious issues that have strained Anglo-French relations since the UK left the European Union. Neither the unauthorised migrant crossings of the English Channel, nor the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland were discussed, in a meeting described as ""constructive"" by Downing Street. Mr Macron and Ms Truss were meeting face-to-face for the first time, weeks after the she questioned whether the French President was a friend or foe. ""I now believe in proof, in results,"" Mr Macron said. ""There is a will to re-engage, to move on and to show that we are allies and friends in a complex world."" Speaking earlier, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"". She said higher energy bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. Typical household energy bills will rise to Â£2,500 a year from 1 October, in part due toreductions in Russian gas exportsduring the war in Ukraine. Under Ms Truss's plans, energy bills will be frozen at that level for the next two years. The scheme is likely to be paid for by increased government borrowing, but the full details will be announced on Friday as part of a mini-Budget. On Wednesday, Ms Truss will use her speech to the United Nations General Assembly to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. The PM will argue that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security to win the new era of strategic competition. Ms Truss will also reiterate her commitment to protecting the UK and its allies, including by increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030. ""Just as we are building a plan for growth at home, we are also developing a new blueprint for our engagement with the world,"" the PM is expected to say. ""We will build resilience and collective security - because they are vital for freedom and democracy.""

Study finds Cambridge 'benefitted from slavery',"The study found the university received money from benefactors in the slave trade The University of Cambridge received ""significant benefits"" from slavery, a report has found. The study was carried out by the Legacies of Enslavement Advisory Group, appointed in 2019 by the university's vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope. It found the university and its colleges benefited from companies and individuals participating in the trade. Prof Toope said it was ""inevitable"" a university ""as long-established as Cambridge"" would have links to slavery. Researchers found that fellows from Cambridge colleges were involved with the East India Company, while investors in the Royal African Company also had links to Cambridge, with both companies active in the slave trade. The university also received donations from investors in both companies, and directly invested in another company active in the slave trade, the South Sea Company, the study revealed. ""Such financial involvement both helped to facilitate the slave trade and brought very significant financial benefits to Cambridge,"" the Legacies of Enslavement report said. Collection changes name to promote women artists Turing sculpture for former college approved Cambridge college returns looted bronze cockerel Following its investigation, the group has made a series of recommendations, which the university said it would implement. These include setting up a dedicated slavery research centre, and enhancing existing academic links with universities in the Caribbean and West Africa. It will also look at increasing the number of postgraduate scholarships and bursaries for black British students and students from Africa and the Caribbean, as well as commissioning a piece of art commemorating the achievements of black academics in the university. The vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Prof Stephen Toope, commissioned the study in 2019 Prof Toope said slavery was ""until the 19th century, a widely accepted system of exploitation"". He said the report ""helps us better appreciate the nature"" of the university's links to slavery. ""It also offers a glimpse into some of the ways in which, as a provider of education, the university played a role in promoting some of the ideas that underpinned the practice of enslavement,"" he said.

What the mini-budget means for you,"Described as a mini-budget, or a fiscal event, there was enough affecting your finances in this statement to fill any full-scale Budget. We did not receive any independent forecasts as we would normally expect, but we already know some of the impact on the pounds and pence in your pocket. So, with the cost of living rising, these are the key announcements from Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng which will affect you. Acut in the basic rate of income taxwill be brought forward by a year. In the Spring, Rishi Sunak, when chancellor, pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Now Mr Kwarteng says this will now happen in April 2023, which the government says will benefit 31 million people with an average Â£170 a year reduction in tax. However, people are facing higher bills and the higher cost of borrowing, and more people have been drawn into paying higher tax bands, because the thresholds have been frozen. What is eye-catching is that the chancellor has pledged to abolish the 45% additional rate of tax, which is paid by people who earn more than Â£150,000 a year, in April 2023. That is a tax saving of nearly Â£3,000 a year for somebody earning Â£200,000 annually. It means the 40% higher rate, for earnings of over Â£50,270, will be the top rate. Income tax bands are different in Scotland, where there arefive different rates,external. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng vows to end 'cycle of stagnation' Anyone on the major benefits - such as universal credit - should expect a rise in what they receive, owing to the link to inflation. However, that will not come until April. Many charities have called for that rise to come earlier. Mr Kwarteng instead concentrated on a plan to cut benefits for those who do not adequately search for work. He said that would mean 120,000 more people on universal credit ""take active steps to seek more and better-paid work, or face having their benefits reduced"". There would be extra support for unemployed people aged over 50 to help get them into work. Stamp duty holidays are often used by governments to encourage activity in the housing market. The theory is that people also spend on things like home improvements and fixtures and fittings after they move, thus boosting economic growth. The tax affects people planning to buy a property. It only applies in England and Northern Ireland. The chancellor said that, instead of a stamp duty holiday, there would bea permanent cut in stamp duty. In detail, it means, the threshold of how much a property has to cost before stamp duty is paid has been changed from Â£125,000 to Â£250,000. First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on the first Â£300,000, and that will be raised to Â£425,000. Discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers will apply up to Â£625,000, an increase from the previous Â£500,000. Homebuyers in London and the South East of England will benefit the most from this. They pay 65% of all stamp duty as prices are higher and the tax is particularly focused on homes of more than Â£500,000, according to research by Zoopla. Three-quarters (76%) of stamp duty came from homes priced at more than Â£500,000. What are the new stamp duty rates? Although announced a day in advance,the reversal of an increase in National Insuranceloomed large in this mini-budget. It will see the 1.25% rise in National Insurance cancelled on 6 November. The Treasury said the change would save nearly 28 million people an average of Â£330 per year. However, the impact varies considerably depending on what you earn, as there are weekly thresholds for National Insurance. There is nothing to pay on the first Â£242 earned per week, then it is 13.25% on earnings between Â£242.01 and Â£967, and 3.25% on the rest. That means, in general, people who earn more than Â£12,570 a year pay National Insurance, and the more they earn, the more they will benefit from this change. For example, somebody earning Â£20,000 will save about Â£93 a year, and somebody earning Â£100,000 will save Â£1,093, compared to now. The increase in National Insurance was designed to raise money for health and social care, which the government says will now be funded through general taxation. Will National Insurance changes leave me better off? By taking income tax and National Insurance cuts together, someone earning Â£20,000 a year will save Â£167 a year, those earning Â£40,000 will save Â£617, someone getting Â£60,000 will save Â£969, and person on Â£100,000 a year will get an extra Â£1,469, according to accountancy firm EY. Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritshave been cancelled. Grocery prices and energy bills are soaring, so much so that there has been a huge package of support to protect people, to a degree, from unmanageable gas and electricity bills. Despite that help, median earners were expecting to see a 3% (Â£600) fall in real income this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Household support will help make a recession, which the Bank of England says we may already be in, not as deep as previously expected. What are your questions on the chancellor's mini-budget?

Kwarteng: Major tax cuts herald new era for UKKwasi Kwarteng announces the biggest tax cuts since 1972 in a significant change of economic policy.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Watch: Stamp duty to income tax - What to know about Kwarteng's 'new era' Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, as he hailed a ""new era"" for the UK economy. Income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in business taxes have been scrapped. Mr Kwarteng said a major change of direction was needed to kick start economic growth. But Labour said it would not solve the cost-of-living crisis and was a ""plan to reward the already wealthy"". It comes as the Bank of Englandwarns the UK may already be in recession. The pound sank to a fresh 37-year low against the dollaras the chancellor gave his statement. Live updates: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng admits Tory economic failure, says Labour What are the new stamp duty rates? In a departure from Boris Johnson's economic policies, Mr Kwarteng has scrapped plans to push up taxes to pay for public services, with the aim of boosting economic growth. In a Commons statement, being dubbed a mini-budget, he said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"", reducing the incentive to work and for businesses to invest. He announced that the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one percentage point to 19% in April- one year earlier than planned. He also unveiled a cut to the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, meaning the UK will have a single higher rate from April. Other measures include: The threshold people in England and Northern Irelandstart paying stamp duty on home purchases will rise to Â£250,000 For first-time buyers the threshold will rise to Â£425,000 and the value of the property they can claim relief will increase from Â£500,000 to Â£625,000 Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritswill be axed The cap on bankers' bonuseswill be lifted New investment zones, where business will benefit from tax cuts and planning rules will be relaxed to encourage house building, will be established Mr Kwartengfulfilled promises to reverse the rise in National Insurance payments introduced by Mr Johnsonto pay for social care and tackle the NHS backlog. He confirmed a planned corporation tax increase from 19% to 25% would also be scrapped. The total cost of the permanent tax cuts announced by the chancellor are estimated at almost Â£45bn by 2027, which the chancellor said would ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". ""We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth,"" he added. Government borrowing will increase by Â£72bn as a result of the announcements, according to the Treasury. The changes to income tax do not apply in Scotland but cuts to corporation tax and national insurance are UK-wide. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the statement amounted to the biggest tax cuts since the 1972 Budget, with the cuts 50% bigger than had been expected. He said that the UK could be borrowing Â£120bn in three years' time to afford the measures. Mr Johnson added that the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. However, he said they were ""manageable"" if economic growth ""really picks up"". This is not a mini-budget. This is a radical tax-cutting economic intervention, which is a significant change of course. Boris Johnson's tax plans have been junked. Many households will save some money, but some of the biggest tax cuts will be for those with the biggest salaries. And this will cost a lot of money. The chancellor's calculation is that it's worth it. People need help with bills and slashing tax will stimulate growth. If you grow the economy, there will be more tax raised and that will help pay the debt in the medium term. But many are sceptical it will work. Senior Conservatives have been warning for months that the strategy is wrong and will saddle future generations with debt. Opposition parties believe the government has the wrong priorities with tax cuts for the wealthy and should be raising more money from a windfall tax on energy company profits. The Treasury hasn't said when it expects to achieve its desired economic growth. But the chancellor is determined to press ahead with a radical change of direction. The big question now: will it work? Labour described his statement as ""an admission of 12 years of economic failure"". ""The Conservatives cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis, and our country cannot afford them anymore,"" shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said. ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today. Not a plan for growth. A plan to reward the already wealthy. A return to the trickle-down of the past. Back to the future, not a brave new era."" Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This was the billionaire's budget, showing the Conservatives are completely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills."" This video can not be played Watch: Labour says Tories created 'vicious circle of stagnation' The statement also included details of the cost of the government's plan to cap energy bills for households and businesses. Mr Kwarteng said these estimated costs were ""particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices"" but based on recent prices the total cost of the package for the six months from October was expected to be around Â£60bn. ""We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long-term energy contracts with suppliers,"" he added. The government normally releases an independent forecast of how major tax changes will impact the economy, but Mr Kwarteng has opted not to do this, as his statement is not technically a Budget. However, Mr Kwarteng promised the Office for Budget Responsibility would publish a full economic forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year. The huge increase in borrowing comes at a time when inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high, leading to higher interest payments. On Thursday the Bank of England raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - in an attempt to cool soaring prices.

Russians flee to border after military call-upGeorgia's border sees large queues after flights sell out as some fighting-age men flee Russia.Europe,"This video can not be played Watch: Sped-up footage appears to show large queues at the Russia-Georgia border Russian men are attempting to leave the country to avoid a military call-up for the Ukraine war. Queues have formed at border crossings since President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation on Wednesday, which could see 300,000 people summoned to fight. The Kremlin says reports of fighting-age men fleeing are exaggerated. But on the border with Georgia, miles-long queues of vehicles have formed including men trying to escape the war. Some of those heading into the neighbouring country have used bicycles to bypass lines of cars and evade a ban on crossing on foot. One of these men, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Nina Akhmeteli that he had waited since 09:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Thursday and managed to cross over late that evening. Another man reported a 12-hour wait, citing the partial mobilisation as a reason for leaving Russia to continue his studies. 'I will break my arm, my leg... anything to avoid the draft' Georgia is one of the few neighbouring countries that Russians can enter without needing to apply for a visa. Finland, which shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with Russia, does require a visa for travel, and also reported an increase in traffic overnight - but said it was at a manageable level. Other destinations reachable by air - such as Istanbul, Belgrade or Dubai - have seen ticket prices skyrocket immediately after the military call-up was announced, with some destinations sold out completely. Turkish media have reported a large spike in one-way ticket sales, while remaining flights to non-visa destinations can cost thousands of euros. Germany's interior minister signalled on Thursday that Russians fleeing the draft would be welcome in her country. Nancy Faeser said deserters threatened by ""severe repression"" would receive protection on a case-by-case basis, following security checks. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Czech Republic struck a different tone, saying they would not offer fleeing Russians refuge. By Olesya Gerasimenko & Liza Fokht, BBC News Sergei - not his real name - has already been called up. The 26-year-old PhD student and lecturer was expecting a delivery of groceries the night before the Putin address, when two men arrived in civilian clothes handing him military papers to sign. The Kremlin said only people who had done their military service and had special skills and combat experience would be called up. But Sergei has no military experience and his stepfather is worried, as dodging the draft is a criminal offence in Russia. Read more on how some Russians are trying to resist the drafthere What does Russia's troop call-up mean for Ukraine? Steve Rosenberg: Putin raises stakes in deadly game The call-up sparked protests in major Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg on Tuesday, resulting in a reported 1,300 arrests. There were also reports from Russia that some of those detained for protesting had been handed draft papers while in custody at police stations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about the reports, said that doing so was not against the law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Russians to resist the mobilisation during his nightly address on Thursday. Referring to Russian deaths in the war, he said: ""Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity."" This video can not be played Watch: Child heard crying as mobilised Russian men leave to fight The reaction to the military mobilisation inside Russia has been unusually strong. The UK's Ministry of Defence, commenting on the call-up in its Wednesday morning briefing, noted that the mobilisation ""is likely to be highly unpopular with parts of the Russian population"". ""Putin is accepting considerable political risk in the hope of generating much-needed combat power. The move is effectively an admission that Russia has exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine,"" it said. Even if successful, challenges remain - and it is unlikely new units will be ready for combat for several more months, the defence intelligence update said. Russian officials insist the call-up will be limited to those who had completed military service, and fall short of widespread conscription. But inside Russia, there is also speculation that the military mobilisation could be larger than formally announced. The independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which moved its operations to Europe amid a post-war crackdown on media, reported that Vladimir Putin's decree contains an additional paragraph which has been classified and kept secret. The newspaper alleges that the secret paragraph allows for a call-up of up to a million people, rather than the reported 300,000, citing an unnamed government source.

Demolition' of the Tories last 12 years - Labour,"In a massive shake-up of the UK's finances, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years The financial markets react badly, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar Kwarteng defends the measures, saying they are ""exactly the right thing"" to do The basic rate of income tax is cut to 19p and the 45% top rate of tax for higher earners abolished - although this doesn't apply in Scotland The threshold before stamp duty is paid in England and Northern Ireland is raised to Â£250,000 - for first time buyers it's Â£425,000 The cap on bankers' bonuses is lifted, and a planned rise in corporation tax scrapped An increase in National Insurance is reversed, and low-tax investment zones will be set up across the UK Labour's shadow chancellor says the plan ""will reward the already wealthy"" and will not help those struggling most with rising prices Edited by Dulcie Lee We're going to wrap up our live coverage now - let's take a look at what we learned today: What happened?Kwasi Kwarteng delivered a sweeping mini-budget in his first major speech as chancellor. What was announced? Find an easy-to-read list of all today's announcementshere. How was it received? The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam has had a look at who are the winners and losers from the government's tax cut announcement. The government is borrowing money to fund these tax cuts, pushing up interest rates and that could affect credit card rates and mortgages. Faisal explains. Watch Faisal tell us the purpose behind the government's strategy: This video can not be played Mini-budget: Are there winners and losers? Dharshini DavidGlobal trade correspondent The UK has underperformed compared to our
major competitors - weâre a less efficient and high-earning nation than
we could be. But is cancelling a
planned rise in corporation tax the answer? That rate is already
below France and Germany - and would remain so even if it increased to 25%. Yet that
hasnât revived investment. And with a recession likely looming, some companies
may not even have profits to spare (or tax). So what would help? Some economists have said the
decline in investment became particularly marked from the time of the 2016
referendum as businesses waited to see how Brexit panned out. The International
Monetary Fund is among those who told me that ending the current dispute with the EU over
post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland could help revive investment, by
removing uncertainty. As we've been reporting, the financial markets haven't reacted well to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's economic announcement, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar. But the government's new growth plan is being welcomed by centre-right think tank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), which voiced particular support for the reversal of the National Insurance hike, the cancellation of a rise in corporation tax and the creation of low-tax investment zones. Tom Clougherty, research
director and head of tax at the CPS, says: ""In its overall tone, and in its
specific announcements, this was the best fiscal statement in years. ""No-one can
doubt the new governmentâs commitment or ambition when it comes to making
Britain more prosperous and dynamic."" It's a
big day for businesses with the creation of new ""investment zones"", that will allow planning rules to be relaxed and will reduce business taxes to encourage investment in parts of the country. The chancellor says the government is involved in early discussions with regions across England to establish the new zones, as well as the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Asif
Hamid, chief executive of The Contact Company, a Merseyside-based customer
service company which employs over 1,000 people, said he would be ""really
interested"" if his region became an investment zone. ""We
have got some amazing assets,"" he told the BBC. ""If someone could
supercharge these assets and capabilities and attract investment and encourage
innovation... we have to change and it's part of levelling up."" Liverpool became a free port recently Hamid
said it was important, that local people who ""understand what the
economy and the areas of businesses are"" are consulted by the government
in producing policies aiming to grow different industries. ""I think that's
where the government could make real value on this one,"" he added. Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Within an hour of the chancellor finishing his statement, dozens of people were queuing outside a food bank at All Hallows Church in Leeds. Serving them tea and coffee as they waited in the warm autumnal sunshine, the vicar, the Rev Heston Groenewald, said he was frustrated by what the government had announced this morning. âItâs not going to make positive change in the lives of the folks that we spend our days with. Itâs increasing inequality rather than decreasing it, and that sucks,"" he said. ""I wish they would visit us and walk in the shoes of the people who are struggling with the cost of living crisis. âIt feels as though thereâs a big disconnect between whatâs going on on the ground and the decisions being made in Whitehall.â Simon JackBusiness editor If the UK economy
is to grow, businesses will have to invest. The government's pitch to domestic and
international investors is simple - if you invest, you will pay lower tax, your
workers will take home more pay and regulation will be less onerous. Scrapping the cap on bankers' bonuses is a come hither to international banks who have resented
paying higher basic salaries in Europe because it increases their fixed-costs
relative to their sometimes volatile profits. A new generation of investment
zones will see tax reliefs on investment and big discounts on stamp duty and
business rates. A pledge that planning and environmental obstacles to
development will be removed has been promised before but has often foundered
on concerns of local communities. It remains to be seen whether these measures
will just see firms relocate existing operations rather than spawning new
economic activity. But perhaps the biggest impediment to the kind of investment
the government wants and needs is the short-term nature of the six-month support
package for businesses struggling with their energy bills. Measures to halve the bills firms would have received this winterhave been welcomed but few
businesses plan six months in advance. If anything, heavy selling of both the
pound and UK government bonds signal the rest of the world thinks the UK's
economic prospects may have taken a turn for the worse today. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, says the government
is ""totally out of touch with ordinary people and businesses"" adding
that their plan won't help the ""millions of struggling families faced with
soaring bills for energy, food and mortgages"". He tells the BBC: The Conservatives are prioritising banks and bankers, oil and gas companies and air profits and the 1% richest and that's not what our country needs - we need an economic plan to help everybody.  Davey says a windfall tax on oil and gas companies could raise more than Â£30bn over time to help people with energy costs. He says the government has announced ""irresponsible tax cuts for large companies"" and are ""borrowing recklessly"". As we heard a little earlier, our political editor Chris Mason has questioned Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng about his plans for the economy. One of Kwarteng's colleagues said the plans were ""a massive gamble"" - see how he reacts to that below: This video can not be played Georgina RannardClimate and science reporter In some potentially good news for the climate, the government says it will make it easier to build onshore wind farms in England. It promises to âunlock the potential of onshore windâ by bringing planning rules in line with other infrastructure. Strict planning laws introduced in 2015 effectively stopped the construction of onshore wind farms - an objection from just one person has been enough to stop a project. As well as being good for the planet, onshore wind is a substantial source of cheap energy. In 2011 farms produced enough renewable electricity to power almost 2.4 million households,according to government figures,external. Environmental groups are welcoming the move, saying it was long overdue. But they caution that it follows government plans to lift the ban on fracking and drill for more North Sea oil and gas - both of which threaten the UKâs pledges to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We've been out in Norwich, Norfolk, to gauge people's opinions on today's mini-budget. A couple, who had just bought a house together, will not benefit from the change in stamp duty. See how they, and others, react below: This video can not be played Chris MasonPolitical editor Technically, this wasnât even a Budget. The chancellor didn't wave his red box around on the doorstep of 11 Downing Street. But, inside the blue booklet tucked under his arm as he left for the Commons, were the biggest tax cuts in 50 years. What we have heard today amounts to a wholesale shredding of previous economic policy; both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years, and those of Labour before that. Economic growth, and plenty of it, is the prize sought - but it is a gamble. Ministers can't be certain it will work, nor that the methods used will be popular. They think that doing nothing, the status quo, would be worse - a sluggish economy combined with spiralling prices condemning them to the doom of election defeat. But combine colossal extra borrowing, an acknowledgement the rich will get richer and an economy the Bank of England reckons might already be in recession: together they mean the government has a big persuasion job on its hands, convincing people they know what they're doing, and that we'll all be collectively better off as a result. The government hopes this set of measures will give the economy a giant injection of oomph. It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are bold and stark. And the water is very clear and very blue. Finally, Chris Mason asks the chancellor whether he will acknowledge
that the UKâs economic picture is bleak. Kwarteng responds: ""I donât think itâs bleak, I think there are global challenges - if you look at unemployment, itâs at a 50-year low, if you
look at things in R&D [research and development)] and science and tech, itâs very positive. ""Thereâs a global challenge with electricity prices. Weâre
confident weâve got the right policies to steer us through this and weâre confident
we can grow the economy."" Explaining the reason for scrapping the limits on bankers' bonuses,
Kwarteng says this âis simpleâ. ""Theyâre taxed at nearly 50% now... I want London
to be an international competitive hub. If we look around the world, even in Paris,
bankers are taxed at 30%. ""I donât want bankers to go to Paris, I want them to earn
here."" Asked whether he is worried about the state of the economy given inflation and the value of the pound, the chancellor says that though there are global challenges, his government's intervention is ""exactly the right thing."" ""Clearly Putin's invasion has affected everybody in Europe with higher energy prices,"" he says. But ""our intervention was exactly the right thing,"" he says. ""We simply couldn't tax our way to prosperity, we couldn't simply keep loading people with more tax burdens during the cost of living crisis,"" he says. Our political editor Chris Mason asks why the chancellor has chosen to pile up the borrowing with the mini-budget? Kwarteng responds by stating that the very high energy prices and lack of growth in the UK meant the government had to act to help people. There's been ""a real problem"" with ""sluggish growth"" in the UK, he says. As a result, ""in order to kickstart the economy"", a different approach needed to be taken, which focuses on ""generating growth,"" he explains. ""So what we've done is to try and incentivise investment deliberately,"" he says. ""Broadly, lots of people feel that we've got to get Britain moving,"" he adds. In an interview with our political editor Chris Mason, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is adamant that the government's changes to tax, stamp duty and benefits are not a gamble. ""What was [a gamble] in my view, was sticking to the course we were on."" he says, adding it was ""unsustainable"" to have taxes the highest they had been since

investment, and critically helping people on lower incomes keep more of the money

She says it's a ""stunning admission from the chancellor"" that the UK is in a vicious cycle of low growth, ""criticising other Conservative governments, of which he has been a part"". Reeves says it's reckless to continue borrowing money, as this generation and future generations will have to fund the costs. She adds, the Conservative government is more concerned about protecting the windfall profit of energy producers, rather than helping families with their energy bills and protecting tax payers against excessive borrowing. Commenting on the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar, Reeves says ""we've seen the verdicts of the markets, they are very worried about the higher borrowing, higher government debt"".

I will be in place until April next year A Treasury-led review will look at what measures should be put in place after this date How is the energy price cap changing? What was announced: The government had promised to change the rules on off-payroll working,known as IR35,external, so companies were no longer responsible for ensuring their contractors were paying the right amount of tax. It said the current system created ""unnecessary complexity and cost"" for businesses. What has changed: This reform, which the government said would have cost Â£2bn a year, will no longer go ahead. Other measures that have been cancelled include: VAT-free shopping for overseas visitors, which the government said would cost Â£2bn A freeze on alcohol duty, which would have cost Â£600m Cuts to the tax paid on shareholders' dividends.

Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?What are the new stamp duty rates?Demolition' of the Tories last 12 years - LabourVideoVideoFirst words from Kwarteng as he sets out mini-budget,"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

What are the new stamp duty rates?Demolition' of the Tories last 12 years - LabourVideoVideoFirst words from Kwarteng as he sets out mini-budget,"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home.

In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

Demolition' of the Tories last 12 years - LabourVideoVideoFirst words from Kwarteng as he sets out mini-budget,"In a massive shake-up of the UK's finances, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils the biggest tax cutting moves in 50 years The financial markets react badly, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar Kwarteng defends the measures, saying they are ""exactly the right thing"" to do The basic rate of income tax is cut to 19p and the 45% top rate of tax for higher earners abolished - although this doesn't apply in Scotland The threshold before stamp duty is paid in England and Northern Ireland is raised to Â£250,000 - for first time buyers it's Â£425,000 The cap on bankers' bonuses is lifted, and a planned rise in corporation tax scrapped An increase in National Insurance is reversed, and low-tax investment zones will be set up across the UK Labour's shadow chancellor says the plan ""will reward the already wealthy"" and will not help those struggling most with rising prices Edited by Dulcie Lee We're going to wrap up our live coverage now - let's take a look at what we learned today: What happened?Kwasi Kwarteng delivered a sweeping mini-budget in his first major speech as chancellor. What was announced? Find an easy-to-read list of all today's announcementshere. How was it received? The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam has had a look at who are the winners and losers from the government's tax cut announcement. The government is borrowing money to fund these tax cuts, pushing up interest rates and that could affect credit card rates and mortgages. Faisal explains. Watch Faisal tell us the purpose behind the government's strategy: This video can not be played Mini-budget: Are there winners and losers? Dharshini DavidGlobal trade correspondent The UK has underperformed compared to our
major competitors - weâre a less efficient and high-earning nation than
we could be. But is cancelling a
planned rise in corporation tax the answer? That rate is already
below France and Germany - and would remain so even if it increased to 25%. Yet that
hasnât revived investment. And with a recession likely looming, some companies
may not even have profits to spare (or tax). So what would help? Some economists have said the
decline in investment became particularly marked from the time of the 2016
referendum as businesses waited to see how Brexit panned out. The International
Monetary Fund is among those who told me that ending the current dispute with the EU over
post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland could help revive investment, by
removing uncertainty. As we've been reporting, the financial markets haven't reacted well to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's economic announcement, with the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar. But the government's new growth plan is being welcomed by centre-right think tank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), which voiced particular support for the reversal of the National Insurance hike, the cancellation of a rise in corporation tax and the creation of low-tax investment zones. Tom Clougherty, research
director and head of tax at the CPS, says: ""In its overall tone, and in its
specific announcements, this was the best fiscal statement in years. ""No-one can
doubt the new governmentâs commitment or ambition when it comes to making
Britain more prosperous and dynamic."" It's a
big day for businesses with the creation of new ""investment zones"", that will allow planning rules to be relaxed and will reduce business taxes to encourage investment in parts of the country. The chancellor says the government is involved in early discussions with regions across England to establish the new zones, as well as the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Asif
Hamid, chief executive of The Contact Company, a Merseyside-based customer
service company which employs over 1,000 people, said he would be ""really
interested"" if his region became an investment zone. ""We
have got some amazing assets,"" he told the BBC. ""If someone could
supercharge these assets and capabilities and attract investment and encourage
innovation... we have to change and it's part of levelling up."" Liverpool became a free port recently Hamid
said it was important, that local people who ""understand what the
economy and the areas of businesses are"" are consulted by the government
in producing policies aiming to grow different industries. ""I think that's
where the government could make real value on this one,"" he added. Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Within an hour of the chancellor finishing his statement, dozens of people were queuing outside a food bank at All Hallows Church in Leeds. Serving them tea and coffee as they waited in the warm autumnal sunshine, the vicar, the Rev Heston Groenewald, said he was frustrated by what the government had announced this morning. âItâs not going to make positive change in the lives of the folks that we spend our days with. Itâs increasing inequality rather than decreasing it, and that sucks,"" he said. ""I wish they would visit us and walk in the shoes of the people who are struggling with the cost of living crisis. âIt feels as though thereâs a big disconnect between whatâs going on on the ground and the decisions being made in Whitehall.â Simon JackBusiness editor If the UK economy
is to grow, businesses will have to invest. The government's pitch to domestic and
international investors is simple - if you invest, you will pay lower tax, your
workers will take home more pay and regulation will be less onerous. Scrapping the cap on bankers' bonuses is a come hither to international banks who have resented
paying higher basic salaries in Europe because it increases their fixed-costs
relative to their sometimes volatile profits. A new generation of investment
zones will see tax reliefs on investment and big discounts on stamp duty and
business rates. A pledge that planning and environmental obstacles to
development will be removed has been promised before but has often foundered
on concerns of local communities. It remains to be seen whether these measures
will just see firms relocate existing operations rather than spawning new
economic activity. But perhaps the biggest impediment to the kind of investment
the government wants and needs is the short-term nature of the six-month support
package for businesses struggling with their energy bills. Measures to halve the bills firms would have received this winterhave been welcomed but few
businesses plan six months in advance. If anything, heavy selling of both the
pound and UK government bonds signal the rest of the world thinks the UK's
economic prospects may have taken a turn for the worse today. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, says the government
is ""totally out of touch with ordinary people and businesses"" adding
that their plan won't help the ""millions of struggling families faced with
soaring bills for energy, food and mortgages"". He tells the BBC: The Conservatives are prioritising banks and bankers, oil and gas companies and air profits and the 1% richest and that's not what our country needs - we need an economic plan to help everybody.  Davey says a windfall tax on oil and gas companies could raise more than Â£30bn over time to help people with energy costs. He says the government has announced ""irresponsible tax cuts for large companies"" and are ""borrowing recklessly"". As we heard a little earlier, our political editor Chris Mason has questioned Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng about his plans for the economy. One of Kwarteng's colleagues said the plans were ""a massive gamble"" - see how he reacts to that below: This video can not be played Georgina RannardClimate and science reporter In some potentially good news for the climate, the government says it will make it easier to build onshore wind farms in England. It promises to âunlock the potential of onshore windâ by bringing planning rules in line with other infrastructure. Strict planning laws introduced in 2015 effectively stopped the construction of onshore wind farms - an objection from just one person has been enough to stop a project. As well as being good for the planet, onshore wind is a substantial source of cheap energy. In 2011 farms produced enough renewable electricity to power almost 2.4 million households,according to government figures,external. Environmental groups are welcoming the move, saying it was long overdue. But they caution that it follows government plans to lift the ban on fracking and drill for more North Sea oil and gas - both of which threaten the UKâs pledges to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We've been out in Norwich, Norfolk, to gauge people's opinions on today's mini-budget. A couple, who had just bought a house together, will not benefit from the change in stamp duty. See how they, and others, react below: This video can not be played Chris MasonPolitical editor Technically, this wasnât even a Budget. The chancellor didn't wave his red box around on the doorstep of 11 Downing Street. But, inside the blue booklet tucked under his arm as he left for the Commons, were the biggest tax cuts in 50 years. What we have heard today amounts to a wholesale shredding of previous economic policy; both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years, and those of Labour before that. Economic growth, and plenty of it, is the prize sought - but it is a gamble. Ministers can't be certain it will work, nor that the methods used will be popular. They think that doing nothing, the status quo, would be worse - a sluggish economy combined with spiralling prices condemning them to the doom of election defeat. But combine colossal extra borrowing, an acknowledgement the rich will get richer and an economy the Bank of England reckons might already be in recession: together they mean the government has a big persuasion job on its hands, convincing people they know what they're doing, and that we'll all be collectively better off as a result. The government hopes this set of measures will give the economy a giant injection of oomph. It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are bold and stark. And the water is very clear and very blue. Finally, Chris Mason asks the chancellor whether he will acknowledge
that the UKâs economic picture is bleak. Kwarteng responds: ""I donât think itâs bleak, I think there are global challenges - if you look at unemployment, itâs at a 50-year low, if you
look at things in R&D [research and development)] and science and tech, itâs very positive. ""Thereâs a global challenge with electricity prices. Weâre
confident weâve got the right policies to steer us through this and weâre confident
we can grow the economy."" Explaining the reason for scrapping the limits on bankers' bonuses,
Kwarteng says this âis simpleâ. ""Theyâre taxed at nearly 50% now... I want London
to be an international competitive hub. If we look around the world, even in Paris,
bankers are taxed at 30%. ""I donât want bankers to go to Paris, I want them to earn
here."" Asked whether he is worried about the state of the economy given inflation and the value of the pound, the chancellor says that though there are global challenges, his government's intervention is ""exactly the right thing."" ""Clearly Putin's invasion has affected everybody in Europe with higher energy prices,"" he says. But ""our intervention was exactly the right thing,"" he says. ""We simply couldn't tax our way to prosperity, we couldn't simply keep loading people with more tax burdens during the cost of living crisis,"" he says. Our political editor Chris Mason asks why the chancellor has chosen to pile up the borrowing with the mini-budget? Kwarteng responds by stating that the very high energy prices and lack of growth in the UK meant the government had to act to help people. There's been ""a real problem"" with ""sluggish growth"" in the UK, he says. As a result, ""in order to kickstart the economy"", a different approach needed to be taken, which focuses on ""generating growth,"" he explains. ""So what we've done is to try and incentivise investment deliberately,"" he says. ""Broadly, lots of people feel that we've got to get Britain moving,"" he adds. In an interview with our political editor Chris Mason, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is adamant that the government's changes to tax, stamp duty and benefits are not a gamble. ""What was [a gamble] in my view, was sticking to the course we were on."" he says, adding it was ""unsustainable"" to have taxes the highest they had been since
the late 1940s. ""We had to have a reboot, a rethink, pushing growth and incentivising
investment, and critically helping people on lower incomes keep more of the money
they earn."" He says the economy was in the situation it is today due to ""low growth, highest taxes anywhere in the G7 and increasing
those taxes - no other G7 country was increasing taxes to deal with cost of living
crisis"". People are changing sentiment already and weâre very hopeful going into next year, through winter, weâll be in a much better place."" Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng Kwarteng says the Covid-19 pandemic and Putinâs war on Ukraine has had a global effect, and says it was ""absolutely right"" that the government helped people with an energy intervention and a reduced tax burden. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has just been speaking to the BBC about today's mini-budget. She says it's a ""stunning admission from the chancellor"" that the UK is in a vicious cycle of low growth, ""criticising other Conservative governments, of which he has been a part"". Reeves says it's reckless to continue borrowing money, as this generation and future generations will have to fund the costs. She adds, the Conservative government is more concerned about protecting the windfall profit of energy producers, rather than helping families with their energy bills and protecting tax payers against excessive borrowing. Commenting on the pound falling to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar, Reeves says ""we've seen the verdicts of the markets, they are very worried about the higher borrowing, higher government debt"". ""It's the wrong tax cut, at the wrong time"", Reeves adds. PM Liz Truss and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng visited a business in Kent after the morning's announcement in the Commons If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main events of the day. After announcing a bold set of tax cuts in his mini-budget this morning, the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said today is a ""very good day for the UK"". Speaking to reporters during a visit to a factory in Kent this afternoon, he said the path the UK was on was ""unsustainable"" and it was ""absolutely fair to reduce people's taxes"". But as we've reported, following his mini-budget announcements the British pound has fallen 3% against the dollar. Asked whether the fall was good for the economy, the chancellor said: ""I don't comment on market movements."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Kwarteng vows to end 'cycle of stagnation',"This video can not be played Watch: Stamp duty to income tax - What to know about Kwarteng's 'new era' Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has unveiled the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years, as he hailed a ""new era"" for the UK economy. Income tax and the stamp duty on home purchases will be cut and planned rises in business taxes have been scrapped. Mr Kwarteng said a major change of direction was needed to kick start economic growth. But Labour said it would not solve the cost-of-living crisis and was a ""plan to reward the already wealthy"". It comes as the Bank of Englandwarns the UK may already be in recession. The pound sank to a fresh 37-year low against the dollaras the chancellor gave his statement. Live updates: Chancellor unveils tax cuts in bid to boost growth At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Kwarteng admits Tory economic failure, says Labour What are the new stamp duty rates? In a departure from Boris Johnson's economic policies, Mr Kwarteng has scrapped plans to push up taxes to pay for public services, with the aim of boosting economic growth. In a Commons statement, being dubbed a mini-budget, he said high tax rates ""damage Britain's competitiveness"", reducing the incentive to work and for businesses to invest. He announced that the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one percentage point to 19% in April- one year earlier than planned. He also unveiled a cut to the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, meaning the UK will have a single higher rate from April. Other measures include: The threshold people in England and Northern Irelandstart paying stamp duty on home purchases will rise to Â£250,000 For first-time buyers the threshold will rise to Â£425,000 and the value of the property they can claim relief will increase from Â£500,000 to Â£625,000 Planned increases in the duty rates for beer, cider, wine and spiritswill be axed The cap on bankers' bonuseswill be lifted New investment zones, where business will benefit from tax cuts and planning rules will be relaxed to encourage house building, will be established Mr Kwartengfulfilled promises to reverse the rise in National Insurance payments introduced by Mr Johnsonto pay for social care and tackle the NHS backlog. He confirmed a planned corporation tax increase from 19% to 25% would also be scrapped. The total cost of the permanent tax cuts announced by the chancellor are estimated at almost Â£45bn by 2027, which the chancellor said would ""turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth"". ""We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth,"" he added. Government borrowing will increase by Â£72bn as a result of the announcements, according to the Treasury. The changes to income tax do not apply in Scotland but cuts to corporation tax and national insurance are UK-wide. Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the statement amounted to the biggest tax cuts since the 1972 Budget, with the cuts 50% bigger than had been expected. He said that the UK could be borrowing Â£120bn in three years' time to afford the measures. Mr Johnson added that the plans were a ""big gamble"", with money being pumped into the economy when inflation remains high. However, he said they were ""manageable"" if economic growth ""really picks up"". This is not a mini-budget. This is a radical tax-cutting economic intervention, which is a significant change of course. Boris Johnson's tax plans have been junked. Many households will save some money, but some of the biggest tax cuts will be for those with the biggest salaries. And this will cost a lot of money. The chancellor's calculation is that it's worth it. People need help with bills and slashing tax will stimulate growth. If you grow the economy, there will be more tax raised and that will help pay the debt in the medium term. But many are sceptical it will work. Senior Conservatives have been warning for months that the strategy is wrong and will saddle future generations with debt. Opposition parties believe the government has the wrong priorities with tax cuts for the wealthy and should be raising more money from a windfall tax on energy company profits. The Treasury hasn't said when it expects to achieve its desired economic growth. But the chancellor is determined to press ahead with a radical change of direction. The big question now: will it work? Labour described his statement as ""an admission of 12 years of economic failure"". ""The Conservatives cannot solve the cost-of-living crisis, the Conservatives are the cost-of-living crisis, and our country cannot afford them anymore,"" shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said. ""The chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today. Not a plan for growth. A plan to reward the already wealthy. A return to the trickle-down of the past. Back to the future, not a brave new era."" Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""This was the billionaire's budget, showing the Conservatives are completely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills.""

Mr Kwarteng said these estimated costs were ""particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices"" but based on recent prices the total cost of the package for the six months from October was expected to be around Â£60bn. ""We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long-term energy contracts with suppliers,"" he added. The government normally releases an independent forecast of how major tax changes will impact the economy, but Mr Kwarteng has opted not to do this, as his statement is not technically a Budget. However, Mr Kwarteng promised the Office for Budget Responsibility would publish a full economic forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year. The huge increase in borrowing comes at a time when inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high, leading to higher interest payments. On Thursday the Bank of England raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - in an attempt to cool soaring prices.
