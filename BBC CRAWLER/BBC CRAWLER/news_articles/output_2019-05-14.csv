PM and Corbyn holding Brexit meeting,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are meeting to discuss ongoing Brexit talks between their two parties. A Labour source told the BBC it was about ""keeping in touch"" after meetings of both the PM's cabinet and the opposition leader's shadow cabinet. Earlier, Labour's John McDonnell said there had been no ""significant shift"" in the government position. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a compromise was not impossible but talks could not continue ""indefinitely"". The discussions have been going on for weeks with little sign of progress. Following a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said ministers had agreed they would continue. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event in London, the shadow chancellor, Mr McDonnell, criticised a letter from senior Tories to Mrs May urging her not to agree a deal with Labour that includes a customs union. The letter has been signed by 13 former Tory cabinet ministers and Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee. PM's negotiator heads to Brussels Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Why is the customs union so important? Mr McDonnell said Labour had not seen enough movement from ministers to reach a deal - especially on the issue of a customs union with the EU - and insisted Labour had ""compromised in some areas"", but ""we're not near what we want"". He said the letter gave Labour ""no security"" that any deal done would be honoured in the long-term - especially once Mrs May is replaced as Tory leader. This video can not be played John McDonnell insists Labour has offered some compromises ""We've gone into this in really good faith, we've tried to put party politics to one side,"" Mr McDonnell added. ""Our big problem now is if we're going to march our troops in Parliament to the top of the hill to vote for a deal and then that's overturned, literally, in weeks, I think that would be a cataclysmic act of bad faith."" But speaking at the same event, Mr Hunt said there was ""potential"" for a deal because it was in the interests of both main parties to resolve the Brexit impasse. ""Both of us would be crucified by our base if we went into a general election having promised that we would respect the referendum result and not having respected it,"" he added. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says it is ""impressive"" how long cross-party talks have lasted Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. So far both sides have resisted calls to set a deadline on the negotiations. But the prime minister's official spokesman said the government believed it was ""imperative"" that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation required to leave the EU - was brought to Parliament in time for it pass all its stages by the summer recess. No date has so far been set for the summer recess, but Parliament usually rises towards the end of July. The cabinet discussions came as the PM's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins travelled to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the political declaration between the UK and the EU. The document sets out the parameters for the future relationship, and Labour negotiators have insisted that any deal they strike with ministers must be reflected in changes to it. They want a permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU after Brexit, meaning there would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods sold between the UK and the rest of the bloc. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, something many Brexit-supporting Tory MPs support. Any Brexit deal 'must include fresh vote' Brexit: What is Labour's customs union policy? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. The big question at Westminster is how long can these talks go on for. The answer appears to be, a little while longer. But the odds are stacked against a Tory-Labour compromise. Labour doesn't think the government has moved far enough. They remain worried that Theresa May's replacement will come in and decide they don't like what has been agreed and try to rip it up. On the other side, prominent Tories are seething at the idea a customs union could be the price of getting a Brexit deal through. No 10 sources said this morning the PM won't agree to a permanent customs union - but the idea of a temporary solution is exactly what frightens many on the Labour side. In this process, taking a step to keep one group happy appears to mean you make another more annoyed. Cabinet agreed today it was ""imperative"" that legislation to allow the UK's withdrawal is brought back to Parliament in time to pass before the summer recess. That sets up the prospect of another set of big Brexit votes in the coming weeks. But for now, there's more talk than action. Mr McDonnell also said Labour had told ministers they ""may well have to concede that there is a public vote of some sort"" to get a deal through Parliament. At the weekend, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a ""significant number, probably 120 if not 150"" of Labour MPs would not back deal without a ""confirmatory vote"". On the prospect of another referendum, Mr McDonnell said: ""My view is that you'd put the deal to the people, but you'd have to also have the option of the status quo. ""Deep in my heart, I'm still a Remainer, but I've got to try and bring together effectively what is a British compromise."" Asked if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also a Remainer in his heart, the shadow chancellor responded: ""Yes."" But Jeremy Hunt said another referendum or a general election were the ""least likely outcomes"" of the current Brexit stalemate. ""When approximately half your constituents have voted to leave the EU, just imagine their anger if you went on to support a second referendum where you're basically saying 'we think you got it wrong first time'.""

Kuenssberg: Policy and politics,"Are the talks between the government and the opposition dead? Not yet. Olly Robbins, (remember him?) the government's Brexit negotiator, is off to Brussels on Tuesday to talk about how long it might take, and how the broad outline of the future arrangement between the EU and the UK could be changed if there were to be some kind of deal. On its own, that sounds rather promising. It's been a demand from Labour that there would be changes to the so-called political declaration so that any compromises can be trusted. And broadly, the actual policies of the two main Westminster parties aren't so far apart after all. If you squint at the detail you can just about see where, with some understanding, and urgency, they could collide. Remember the political declaration, that guide to the future, is rather helpfully vague. One cabinet minister told me tonight ""we could sort the real policy differences out in an afternoon"". Of course there are disagreements on detail, tone, and ambition for the long term outcome. But if these talks fail it won't be because the two parties have an entirely different set of ideas about our actual departure when it comes at least to the first part of Brexit, the divorce deal withdrawal agreement. Brexit: Cross-party deal must include new referendum - Sir Keir Starmer Brexit: What's in the political declaration? This process though is not just about the policy, it's about the politics too. And with unease on the Tory side, expressed explicitly in a letter to Theresa May today from former ministers, about softening up their Brexit plan at all, and division on the Labour side about signing up to anything without a promise of another referendum, the reality of getting anything agreed threatens to choke it off. And as each day passes it becomes harder - Theresa May's hold on government becomes more slippery, undermining her chances of selling anything to her party, and eroding Labour's faith that they could sign up to anything that lasts. And actors on both sides do agree on something -  that while they talk, rather than decide, it's leaving a vacuum that makes the divisions at Westminster and beyond worse. The visible agonies of their attempts to compromise are making more space for those offering clear sounding solutions - whether that's leaving without a deal, changing the prime minister or holding another public vote. The cabinet and shadow cabinet share the fears that their respective parties suffer in an increasingly brutal and binary Brexit debate. But they seem unlikely to take bold moves suddenly to shift their attitude to doing a deal, when they meet separately and discuss the status of the talks  on Tuesday morning. Another Eurostar trip for Olly Robbins is unlikely to change that.

Victim came 'nose to nose' with attacker,"Richard Livett described how he was rescued after coming face to face with one of the attackers The first person stabbed in the London Bridge attack has described how he came ""nose to nose"" with Khuram Butt, who shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" in his face before stabbing him in the back. Richard Livett, who had been out watching football, first thought he had witnessed an accident when he saw a van crash into railings on June 3, 2017. He told an inquest he went to check on the occupants. But in a ""split second"", his attacker's face was ""an inch or so off"", he said. ""I felt what I thought initially was a punch in the back, which turned out to be him flailing his arm around the back of me and stabbing me,"" Mr Livett told the hearing at London's Old Bailey. He said that after looking at photographs, he could identify the man as Khuram Butt, one of the three attackers. Mr Livett said after he was attacked, he slumped on the ground for a few seconds before deciding to get up and move away. ""It was chaos all around. I was aware of screaming and shouting and people around me,"" he said. ""I think it was a personal mission to get help as quickly as I possibly could. I realised it was quite a serious blow I had taken."" Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened We did our best - London Bridge attack PC He went on to describe how he felt weak before he collapsed and banged on the locked door of the nearby Globe Tavern. Some people, including a soldier and an off-duty doctor, came to his aid before he was helped back towards the bridge to receive medical attention, chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC was told. Another witness, Jack Baxter, told how he saw French-born waiter Alexandre Pigeard, 26, running and holding his neck near Borough Market's Boro Bistro, where he worked. ""He had somebody else running to his right,"" he said. ""They were both running, looking at each other almost in shock at what happened and screaming to each other like 'what's going on?'"" French-born waiter Mr Pigeard, left, and chef Mr Belanger, also from France, were both killed in the attack He told the Old Bailey that he then saw a man, now identified as 36-year-old chef Sebastien Belanger, who was cornered by three knifeman in an archway before being stabbed. Asked how the attackers were behaving, he said that they looked to be acting as a team and appeared to have been trained. The inquest into the deaths of eight victims has also been hearing from Rasak Kalenikanse, the doorman at the Barrowboy and Banker pub next to where the van crashed. Mr Kalenikanse broke down in tears as he described seeing the three attackers standing with knives, while dead and injured people lay around them. He said he heard one of them say: ""We are doing these things in the cause of Allah, you unbelievers."" BBC reporter Alice Evans, at the inquest Much of the inquest today has focused on witnesses' desperate attempts to save those who were wounded. This afternoon Philippe Pigeard listened as a waiter described the moment he found his son, Alexandre Pigeard, mortally wounded on a walkway in the Borough Market area. Dervish Gashi, a waiter at the nearby Cafe Brood, became upset when an image was shown to the court of the bloodied path where he found Mr Pigeard. He wiped a shaky hand across his forehead as he described frantically searching for a pulse. During some of his evidence, Mr Pigeard's father closed his eyes with a pained expression on his face. As Mr Gashi stepped out of the witness box, the bereaved father jumped out of his seat and approached him. He whispered something in his ear and extended his hand out. They shook hands before enveloping in a spontaneous embrace. The gesture of goodwill and solidarity was a brief moment of respite from the graphic narratives that have dominated this inquest. The inquest also heard how three members of the public spent more than half an hour trying to save Mr Belanger after he was stabbed. Craig Smith and his girlfriend, Emma Thompson, were joined by Lisa Deacon, who told how she had been given first aid training a few weeks before the attack. Mr Smith said the chef was initially conscious but became unresponsive as he tried to stop him from bleeding. They were later joined by two police officers who helped them give CPR to Mr Belanger while also keeping watch in case the attackers returned. After 22:45 BST they brought Mr Belanger out to paramedics in Borough High Street.

Ex-Celtic youth football coach admits abuse,"Jim McCafferty leaves court after his sentencing A former youth coach involved in Scottish football has been given a further jail sentence after admitting a series of child sex abuse crimes. Jim McCafferty, 73, was a coach and kit man for the Celtic youth team who also worked for Celtic Boys Club. In court, he admitted 12 charges related to child sex abuse against 10 teenage boys between 1972 and 1996. He was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. He was already serving a jail term for abuse. Last year he washe was found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy in Belfast. In relation to the latest charges, most of his victims played for youth teams he ran in North Lanarkshire. The abuser who preyed on dreams of football stardom Four played for Celtic Boys Club and Celtic youth team. They were aged between 14 and 17. The incidents took place in several locations across Scotland - including team showers, hotel rooms and minibuses. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that among the complainers were former professional footballers. Jim McCafferty was already serving a jail term after a trial in Northern Ireland Some of his victims developed alcohol and mental health problems as a consequence of the abuse he subjected them too. Judge Lord Beckett said McCafferty was ""physically intimidating"" and used his ""overpowering"" nature to achieve his ""depraved objectives"" of abusing young boys. He added: ""You took advantage of your position of trust as a football coach to groom and then sexually abuse boys who played for your teams. ""You were adept at identifying the circumstances of different boys so that you could manipulate them and in some cases their parents in a variety of ways. ""All of this was done to facilitate your sexually abusing children."" He added: ""Careers did not reach their full potential, some were cut short and lives have been seriously blighted. Many of those that you abused have suffered from enduring anxiety and depression caused by what you did. ""Conduct of this kind has a wider effect which is corrupting and socially corrosive. It has the potential to undermine the trust which people place in youth football and sports clubs."" McCafferty's lawyer told the court he wanted to apologise to his victims and their families. He is the fourth man connected to either Celtic or Celtic Boys Club to be found guilty of historical child sex abuse in the past year. Both Jim Torbett (left) and Frank Cairney (right) have been convicted of abusing children at Celtic Boys Club Last NovemberCeltic Boys Club founder Jim Tobett was jailedfor six years for sexually abusing three boys over eight years. Earlier this year, the boys club's former chairman,Gerald King, was given a three-year probation orderfor sexually abusing four boys and a girl in the 1980s. And in FebruaryFrank Cairney, a former manager of the boys club, was jailed for four yearsafter being convicted of nine charges of sexually abusing young footballers. Outside court, Det Ch Insp Sarah Taylor said McCafferty exploited his position to satisfy his own ""sexual depravity"". She paid tribute to the victims who ""lived in fear as boys"", but found the courage and strength to speak out as adults. ""They were listened to and without their testimony we would not be here today witnessing McCafferty's long awaited admissions of guilt,"" she said. ""The scale of his abuse is unprecedented, and demonstrates the systematic and calculated methods he used to target his victims. ""Whether as a respected coach or an affable kit man, he used every opportunity available to perpetrate his callous abuse."" Patrick McGuire, of Thompsons Solicitors, is representing some of McCafferty's victims in civil cases. He called for action from Celtic Football Club. ""McCafferty's connection with Celtic is now utterly undeniable,"" he said. ""We now know that some of the abuse took place in Celtic premises. What he did was groom the boys but at the same time groom the parents, always with Celtic dangling on the end of a stick as a golden carrot. It's just utterly unforgivable. ""McCafferty's conviction is probably the last conviction that we'll see in a Celtic setting. But what's never happened is any form of financial justice for the survivors of abuse at Celtic Park and that's why now all eyes are on the board of Celtic Football Club to do the right thing.""

Steven Dymond, 63, was found dead on 9 May following a recording of the ITV show during which he took a lie detector test. Hampshire Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious. Downing Street called the death ""deeply concerning"", and a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the show was ""the theatre of cruelty"". ITV has already suspended both filming and broadcasting of The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the episode in question will not be screened. The broadcaster said everyone at the show was ""shocked and saddened"" and ""thoughts are with the family and friends"". An inquest into Mr Dymond's death is likely to be opened within the next few days, a spokeswoman for Portsmouth coroner's office said, and they are awaiting the result of the post-mortem investigation. Commenting on the case, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Broadcasters and production companies have a responsibility for the mental health and wellbeing of participants and viewers of their programmes. ""We are clear they must have appropriate levels of support in place."" 'I worked on The Jeremy Kyle Show' This video can not be played Jeremy Kyle Show: Audience member recalls Steven Dymond episode The pre-recorded episode Mr Dymond took part in was based on the subject of infidelity and it is understood he took a lie detector test. A member of the audience who was at the recording, Babette, 20, told the BBC: ""As soon as the test result was announced [Dymond] was already crying but he was shocked. ""His fiancee was heartbroken and sobbing. Steve couldn't believe it had come back as a fail. ""He was put into a position where his story was meant to be entertaining. I'm just shocked by it all."" About one million people watch The Jeremy Kyle Show every day Speaking to The Sun,external, Mr Dymond's former fiancee Jane Callaghan said: ""I know we split up a week ago but we were together for two years. I still loved him. ""We got engaged Christmas Day 2017. He was crying, the love was real. He was the most generous and loving person. ""He was quietly struggling, and we didn't know at the time. He cheated on me, I know he did. I can't forgive but I just want him to be alive."" The basic question prompted by Steve Dymond's death is whether the very genre of which Jeremy Kyle is the personification has any place on our screens. Nobody doubts it is a commercial success. In a highly competitive market, the show has delivered solid ratings for years; and the fact that it has been on air for 14 years is testament to ITV's support for it. But is it right to allow private trauma to become public spectacle? And is the ultimate result nothing less than the exploitation - for commercial gain at ITV, and for voyeuristic viewers - of highly vulnerable people? Read more from Amolhere. Conservative MP Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, has called on Ofcom to carry out an independent review into the duty of care policies in place at The Jeremy Kyle Show and others. He told the BBC that the committee would discuss the issue at a private meeting on Wednesday. Charles Walker MP, who has spoken openly about his own mental health issues, has urged ITV to axe The Jeremy Kyle Show for good. He told the BBC it would be ""extremely sensible"" if ITV said ""this has gone far enough"", adding that it was ""a watershed moment"". Charles Walker says the TV we watch ""is a reflection of ourselves"". Mr Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne and a member of the all-party parliamentary group on suicide and self-harm prevention, told the BBC that guests on The Jeremy Kyle Show were ""not really guests, they're victims"". ""I don't want to pile in on Jeremy Kyle because he probably feels bad enough, although obviously not as bad as the familyâ¦ and this is a shared responsibility,"" Mr Walker said. ""None of this stuff would be made if nobody watched it."" Mr Walker,who has openly talked about having OCD, added: ""Jeremy Kyle is a talented man who can do other things and go on to make other TV shows. The Jeremy Kyle Show will become just a memory. ""Societally, we have a responsibility for why this TV is made, it's a reflection of ourselves that it has been made and so many people watch it. ""It's cruel and there's enough cruelty in the world without showing it on TV."" Labour MP for Sunderland Central, Julie Elliott, agreed the programme should be culled, saying she has had ""grave concerns"" for some time about the way shows like The Jeremy Kyle Show ""appear to exploit the most vulnerable in society"". And psychiatrist Sir Simon Wessely, who was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists until 2017, said: ""I think it should be dropped, actually. It's the theatre of cruelty. ""And yes, it might entertain a million people a day, but then again, so did Christians versus Lions."" The Jeremy Kyle Show is the most popular programme on ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. This video can not be played Former ITV chairman Michael Grade: 'ITV is right to take the show off air' All previous episodes of the show have been taken down from the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will not air on ITV2 either. In an email to staff, ITV boss Dame Carolyn McCall said the decision to take the show off air was ""not in any way a reflection on the show, but the best way we think we can protect the show and the production team from the reaction we expect to this death"". White Dee, as she became known after finding fame on documentary series Benefits Street, defended the show, following an appearance in February. ""I received an awful lot of pre-show care along with a good bit of after-show care,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding it was ""a very positive experience"". White Dee took part in a Jeremy Kyle special on the price of fame ITV said in a statement: ""The Jeremy Kyle Show has significant and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors pre, during and post-show which have been built up over 14 years, and there have been numerous positive outcomes from this, including parties who have resolved complex and long-standing personal problems."" ITV's former executive chairman Michael Grade told the BBC he thought ITV has ""handled it immaculately"". ""I don't think it hurts ITV, they've got a hole in the schedule, they've got some very creative people, they'll come up with some new format, some new idea, it's an opportunity. But they're absolutely right to have taken the programme off the air."" Media watchdog Ofcom said on Monday that it was a ""very distressing case"" and it was in discussion with ITV to understand what took place - but it can only assess content that has been broadcast. The Jeremy Kyle Show has been broadcast in its mid-morning slot since 2005. Its guests discuss relationship issues and conflicts with each other in front of Kyle's studio audience. It is well-known for its often heated debates, with Kyle mediating between guests. This video can not be played Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James: TV producers are well-meaning but are not mental health care experts. Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James, who has worked on various reality TV shows over the last 15 years, told BBC Breakfast that care of TV guests had improved in general but added there was still work to be done. ""One of the difficulties comes from the fact that even though producers want to help, they don't always understand how psychological services work,"" she said.

Brexit bill to be published in early June,"This video can not be played Barclay: There needs to be an ""end point"" to Brexit talks Theresa May is giving MPs another chance to vote on Brexit in early June - whether or not the government and Labour have reached a deal by then. A vote on the bill that would pave the way for Brexit was ""imperative"" if the UK was to leave the EU before MPs' summer recess, Downing Street said. Labour sources say they will not back the bill without a cross-party deal. If Mrs May's plan is defeated, Number 10 saidthe UK is set for no deal or for Article 50 to be revoked,external. That is because the EU will not grant a further extension beyond 31 October, says BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also said the deal the PM negotiated with the EU would be ""dead"" if the bill did not pass. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Mrs May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. But government sources have told the BBC that there would not be a further attempt if the plan is rejected. PM all but out of time to pass Brexit deal Remain parties 'shouldn't squabble' The vote - which will take place when MPs return from half-term recess - would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law via the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. The prime minister has negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs have effectively rejected three times in Commons votes. No 10 described Tuesday evening's discussions between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Brexit as ""both useful and constructive"". Mrs May had made clear the government's ""determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU"", a spokesman said. A Labour party spokesman said Mr Corbyn had ""raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments, following statements by Conservative MPs and cabinet ministers seeking to replace the prime minister"". He said the Labour leader had called for ""further movement"" from the government and the prime minister's team would bring back ""further proposals tomorrow"". Talks continued on Tuesday evening Bringing the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill forward would allow the prime minister to push ahead with her ambition of delivering Brexit before the summer - despite the lack of agreement so far in the cross-party talks, said BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""It is now time for Parliament to make a decision, reflecting the manifestos of both the Conservative and Labour parties at the last general election and to deliver Brexit in the way that the public were promised."" In the 2017 general election, the two main parties promised in their manifestos to respect the result of the Brexit referendum. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said that if MPs do not vote for the government's Brexit plan next month, then it will ""take us to either the potential of revocation of Article 50 or leaving without a deal"". He said MPs will have to decide ""if they want to vote for Brexit or not"". Brexiteer and Conservative MP Steve Baker said bringing the bill forward ""over the heads"" of DUP MPs - on whom the government relies for a majority - would ""eradicate the government's majority"". ""What is the government thinking?"" he asked. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: ""If the prime minister brings the withdrawal bill to the Commons for a vote, the question will be, 'What has changed?'. ""Unless she can demonstrate something new that addresses the problem of the backstop, then it is highly likely her deal will go down to defeat once again."" Thebackstopis the controversial part of the withdrawal deal that aims to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. It's not exactly the same thumbs up or thumbs down that another meaningful vote would be. That is a straightforward yes or no to the divorce deal that the prime minister negotiated with the EU. This time, it will be the Withdrawal Bill which is a whole tome of new laws that will be needed to take us out of the European Union. The draft of that bill is still being kept under wraps. Very, very few people have seen it. It's much more detailed than just a vote on the agreement would be. Of course, that gives people more things to object to. Although Theresa May might have pleaded in cabinet that people on all sides have to move away from absolutism, and move to a mood of compromise, there's not much sign of it. As and when that bill actually emerges, that may well - in the words of one cabinet minister - make things worse before they can get better. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. This is a requirement under the terms of previous Brexit legislation passed last year. The legislation would make the citizens' rights part of the agreement directly enforceable in UK courts, and set their relationship with the EU's Court of Justice. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal, and give effect to the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border. MPs will be able to vote on amendments to the bill, and this could allow ministers to make good on any compromise they reach with Labour in the cross-party talks. If the bill is introduced in the first week of June it will come seven days after the European Parliament elections -  which Education Secretary Damian Hinds has acknowledged could be ""difficult"" for the Conservatives. A state visit by US President Donald Trump and a by-election in Peterborough will also take place that same week.

Amol Rajan: Show faces 'tough questioning',"The death of guest Steve Dymond has put The Jeremy Kyle Show under intense scrutiny The basic question prompted by Steve Dymond's death is whether the very genre of which Jeremy Kyle is the personification has any place on our screens. Nobody doubts it is a commercial success. In a highly competitive market, the show has delivered solid ratings for years; and the fact that it has been on air for 14 years is testament to ITV's support for it. But is it right to allow private trauma to become public spectacle? And is the ultimate result nothing less than the exploitation - for commercial gain at ITV, and for voyeuristic viewers - of highly vulnerable people? Here, some important caveats are vital. Guests on the show have provided their consent. They are familiar with the programme, and generally know what they're getting into. And there is care provided for them by the production team. 'I worked on The Jeremy Kyle Show' But ultimately, is the show really there to help people - or to entertain an audience, both in the studio and at home? Today I interviewed Professor Sir Simon Wessely, Professor of Psychiatry Kings College London. He thinks any claim that the show is about helping people is little short of contemptible, and describes it as a ""theatre of cruelty"" in which people on the edge are exploited. The tough questioning of host Jeremy Kyle has been a daytime TV staple since 2005 What to do with the show is a question for ITV rather than Ofcom who, being a post-transmission regulator, don't want to be accused of censorship. There is a massive disconnect here, between those who don't like what Jeremy Kyle does, and want him off the airwaves, and millions who tune in. Those who want it off air generally don't watch it.

PM and Corbyn to hold Brexit meeting,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are meeting to discuss ongoing Brexit talks between their two parties. A Labour source told the BBC it was about ""keeping in touch"" after meetings of both the PM's cabinet and the opposition leader's shadow cabinet. Earlier, Labour's John McDonnell said there had been no ""significant shift"" in the government position. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a compromise was not impossible but talks could not continue ""indefinitely"". The discussions have been going on for weeks with little sign of progress. Following a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said ministers had agreed they would continue. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event in London, the shadow chancellor, Mr McDonnell, criticised a letter from senior Tories to Mrs May urging her not to agree a deal with Labour that includes a customs union. The letter has been signed by 13 former Tory cabinet ministers and Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee. PM's negotiator heads to Brussels Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Why is the customs union so important? Mr McDonnell said Labour had not seen enough movement from ministers to reach a deal - especially on the issue of a customs union with the EU - and insisted Labour had ""compromised in some areas"", but ""we're not near what we want"". He said the letter gave Labour ""no security"" that any deal done would be honoured in the long-term - especially once Mrs May is replaced as Tory leader. This video can not be played John McDonnell insists Labour has offered some compromises ""We've gone into this in really good faith, we've tried to put party politics to one side,"" Mr McDonnell added. ""Our big problem now is if we're going to march our troops in Parliament to the top of the hill to vote for a deal and then that's overturned, literally, in weeks, I think that would be a cataclysmic act of bad faith."" But speaking at the same event, Mr Hunt said there was ""potential"" for a deal because it was in the interests of both main parties to resolve the Brexit impasse. ""Both of us would be crucified by our base if we went into a general election having promised that we would respect the referendum result and not having respected it,"" he added. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says it is ""impressive"" how long cross-party talks have lasted Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. So far both sides have resisted calls to set a deadline on the negotiations. But the prime minister's official spokesman said the government believed it was ""imperative"" that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation required to leave the EU - was brought to Parliament in time for it pass all its stages by the summer recess. No date has so far been set for the summer recess, but Parliament usually rises towards the end of July. The cabinet discussions came as the PM's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins travelled to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the political declaration between the UK and the EU. The document sets out the parameters for the future relationship, and Labour negotiators have insisted that any deal they strike with ministers must be reflected in changes to it. They want a permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU after Brexit, meaning there would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods sold between the UK and the rest of the bloc. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, something many Brexit-supporting Tory MPs support. Any Brexit deal 'must include fresh vote' Brexit: What is Labour's customs union policy? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. The big question at Westminster is how long can these talks go on for. The answer appears to be, a little while longer. But the odds are stacked against a Tory-Labour compromise. Labour doesn't think the government has moved far enough. They remain worried that Theresa May's replacement will come in and decide they don't like what has been agreed and try to rip it up. On the other side, prominent Tories are seething at the idea a customs union could be the price of getting a Brexit deal through. No 10 sources said this morning the PM won't agree to a permanent customs union - but the idea of a temporary solution is exactly what frightens many on the Labour side. In this process, taking a step to keep one group happy appears to mean you make another more annoyed. Cabinet agreed today it was ""imperative"" that legislation to allow the UK's withdrawal is brought back to Parliament in time to pass before the summer recess. That sets up the prospect of another set of big Brexit votes in the coming weeks. But for now, there's more talk than action. Mr McDonnell also said Labour had told ministers they ""may well have to concede that there is a public vote of some sort"" to get a deal through Parliament. At the weekend, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a ""significant number, probably 120 if not 150"" of Labour MPs would not back deal without a ""confirmatory vote"". On the prospect of another referendum, Mr McDonnell said: ""My view is that you'd put the deal to the people, but you'd have to also have the option of the status quo. ""Deep in my heart, I'm still a Remainer, but I've got to try and bring together effectively what is a British compromise."" Asked if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also a Remainer in his heart, the shadow chancellor responded: ""Yes."" But Jeremy Hunt said another referendum or a general election were the ""least likely outcomes"" of the current Brexit stalemate. ""When approximately half your constituents have voted to leave the EU, just imagine their anger if you went on to support a second referendum where you're basically saying 'we think you got it wrong first time'.""

"WhatsApp discovers surveillance attack""An advanced cyber-actor"" exploited a major flaw in the Facebook-owned messaging service, WhatsApp says.Technology","WhatsApp has 1.5bn users, but it believed the attacks were highly-targeted Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp, it has been confirmed. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a ""select number"" of users and was orchestrated by ""an advanced cyber-actor"". A fix was rolled out on Friday. On Monday, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution. The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firmNSO Group, according to a report in theFinancial Times,external. Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May. WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages areend-to-end encrypted, meaning they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device. However, the surveillance software would have let an attacker read the messages on the target's device. Some users of the app have questioned why the app store notes associated with the latest update are not explicit about the fix. ""Journalists, lawyers, activists and human rights defenders"" are most likely to have been targeted, saidAhmed Zidan,externalfrom the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists. Android Open theGoogle Playstore Tap the menu at the top left of the screen Tap My Apps & Games If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on Android is 2.19.134 iOS Open theApp Store At the bottom of the screen, tap Updates If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on iOS is 2.19.51 It involved attackers using WhatsApp's voice calling function to ring a target's device. Even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software could be installed. According to the FT report, the call would often disappear from the device's call log. WhatsApp told the BBC its security team was the first to identify the flaw. It shared that information with human rights groups, selected security vendors and the US Department of Justice earlier this month. ""The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,â the company said on Monday in a briefing document note for journalists. What is encryption? What we know about the secretive NSO Group The firm also published anadvisory to security specialists,external, in which it described the flaw as: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP [voice over internet protocol] stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP [secure real-time transport protocol] packets sent to a target phone number.â Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was a ""pretty old-fashioned"" method of attack. ""A buffer overflow is where a program runs into memory it should not have access to.  It overflows the memory it should have and hence has access to memory in which malicious code can potentially be run,"" he explained. ""If you are able to pass some code through the app, you can run your own code in that area. ""In VOIP there is an initial process that dials up and establishes the call, and the flaw was in that bit. Consequently you did not need to answer the call for the attack to work."" The NSO Group is an Israeli company that has been referred to in the past as a ""cyber-arms dealer"". While some cyber-security companies report the flaws they find so that they can be fixed, others keep problems to themselves so they can be exploited or sold to law enforcement. The NSO Group ispart-owned by the London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital,external, which acquired a stake in February. NSO's flagship software, Pegasus, has the ability to collect intimate data from a target device, including capturing data through the microphone and camera, and gathering location data. In a statement, the group said: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war WhatsApp sets new rules after mob killings ""The company does not operate the system, and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions. We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary, we take action, including shutting down the system. ""Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation."" WhatsApp said it was too early to know how many users had been affected by the vulnerability, although it added that suspected attacks were highly-targeted. According to theNew York Times,external, one of the people targeted was a London-based lawyer involved in a lawsuit against the NSO Group. Amnesty International, which said it had been targeted by tools created by the NSO Group in the past, said this attack was one human rights groups had long feared was possible. ""They're able to infect your phone without you actually taking an action,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy programme director for Amnesty Tech. She said there was mounting evidence that the tools were being used by regimes to keep prominent activists and journalists under surveillance. ""There needs to be some accountability for this, it can't just continue to be a wild west, secretive industry."" On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv court will hear a petition led by Amnesty International that calls for Israel's Ministry of Defence to revoke the NSO Group's licence to export its products. How many people were targeted?WhatsApp says it is too early in its investigation to say how many people were targeted, or how long the flaw was present in the app Does updating WhatsApp remove the spyware?While the update fixes the flaw that let this attack take place, WhatsApp has not said whether the update removes any spyware that has already infected a compromised device What could the spyware do?WhatsApp has not said whether the attack could extend beyond the confines of WhatsApp, reaching further into a device and accessing emails, photos and more ""Using an app as an attack route is limited on iOS as they run apps in very tightly controlled sandboxes,"" said Prof Woodward. ""We're all assuming that the attack was just a corruption of WhatsApp but analysis is still ongoing. ""The nightmare scenario would be if you could get something much more capable onto the device without the user having to do anything,"" he said.

'No significant shift' in Brexit talks,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are meeting to discuss ongoing Brexit talks between their two parties. A Labour source told the BBC it was about ""keeping in touch"" after meetings of both the PM's cabinet and the opposition leader's shadow cabinet. Earlier, Labour's John McDonnell said there had been no ""significant shift"" in the government position. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a compromise was not impossible but talks could not continue ""indefinitely"". The discussions have been going on for weeks with little sign of progress. Following a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said ministers had agreed they would continue. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event in London, the shadow chancellor, Mr McDonnell, criticised a letter from senior Tories to Mrs May urging her not to agree a deal with Labour that includes a customs union. The letter has been signed by 13 former Tory cabinet ministers and Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee. PM's negotiator heads to Brussels Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Why is the customs union so important? Mr McDonnell said Labour had not seen enough movement from ministers to reach a deal - especially on the issue of a customs union with the EU - and insisted Labour had ""compromised in some areas"", but ""we're not near what we want"". He said the letter gave Labour ""no security"" that any deal done would be honoured in the long-term - especially once Mrs May is replaced as Tory leader. This video can not be played John McDonnell insists Labour has offered some compromises ""We've gone into this in really good faith, we've tried to put party politics to one side,"" Mr McDonnell added. ""Our big problem now is if we're going to march our troops in Parliament to the top of the hill to vote for a deal and then that's overturned, literally, in weeks, I think that would be a cataclysmic act of bad faith."" But speaking at the same event, Mr Hunt said there was ""potential"" for a deal because it was in the interests of both main parties to resolve the Brexit impasse. ""Both of us would be crucified by our base if we went into a general election having promised that we would respect the referendum result and not having respected it,"" he added. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says it is ""impressive"" how long cross-party talks have lasted Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. So far both sides have resisted calls to set a deadline on the negotiations. But the prime minister's official spokesman said the government believed it was ""imperative"" that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation required to leave the EU - was brought to Parliament in time for it pass all its stages by the summer recess. No date has so far been set for the summer recess, but Parliament usually rises towards the end of July. The cabinet discussions came as the PM's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins travelled to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the political declaration between the UK and the EU. The document sets out the parameters for the future relationship, and Labour negotiators have insisted that any deal they strike with ministers must be reflected in changes to it. They want a permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU after Brexit, meaning there would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods sold between the UK and the rest of the bloc. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, something many Brexit-supporting Tory MPs support. Any Brexit deal 'must include fresh vote' Brexit: What is Labour's customs union policy? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. The big question at Westminster is how long can these talks go on for. The answer appears to be, a little while longer. But the odds are stacked against a Tory-Labour compromise. Labour doesn't think the government has moved far enough. They remain worried that Theresa May's replacement will come in and decide they don't like what has been agreed and try to rip it up. On the other side, prominent Tories are seething at the idea a customs union could be the price of getting a Brexit deal through. No 10 sources said this morning the PM won't agree to a permanent customs union - but the idea of a temporary solution is exactly what frightens many on the Labour side. In this process, taking a step to keep one group happy appears to mean you make another more annoyed. Cabinet agreed today it was ""imperative"" that legislation to allow the UK's withdrawal is brought back to Parliament in time to pass before the summer recess. That sets up the prospect of another set of big Brexit votes in the coming weeks. But for now, there's more talk than action. Mr McDonnell also said Labour had told ministers they ""may well have to concede that there is a public vote of some sort"" to get a deal through Parliament. At the weekend, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a ""significant number, probably 120 if not 150"" of Labour MPs would not back deal without a ""confirmatory vote"". On the prospect of another referendum, Mr McDonnell said: ""My view is that you'd put the deal to the people, but you'd have to also have the option of the status quo. ""Deep in my heart, I'm still a Remainer, but I've got to try and bring together effectively what is a British compromise."" Asked if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also a Remainer in his heart, the shadow chancellor responded: ""Yes."" But Jeremy Hunt said another referendum or a general election were the ""least likely outcomes"" of the current Brexit stalemate. ""When approximately half your constituents have voted to leave the EU, just imagine their anger if you went on to support a second referendum where you're basically saying 'we think you got it wrong first time'.""

British Steel seeks loan for 'Brexit issues',"British Steel's Scunthorpe plant British Steel has said it is seeking further financial support from the government to help it address ""Brexit-related issues"". It follows reports the company needs a loan of up to Â£75m to keep trading in the coming months. The UK's second largest steel firm employs 4,500 people, and about 20,000â indirectly via its supply chain. The company said ""uncertainties around Brexit are posing challenges for all businesses including British Steel"". It added: ""We are holding constructive discussions with our stakeholders on how to navigate them. ""Discussions are continuing about a package of additional support to assist the company address broader Brexit-related issues, whilst continuing with [the company's] investment plans."" A spokesperson for the the Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy said: ""As this is speculation, we won't be commenting."" British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has sites in Teesside, Cumbria and North Yorkshire. The move comes just two weeks afterBritish Steel secured a Â£100m loan from the governmentto pay its EU carbon bill. The money meant the private equity-owned firm could avoid a steep EU fine. According to Sky News,external, in recent days the steel maker has met its lenders and the government to discuss another loan. British Steel has reportedly faced a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has also been struggling with the prolonged weakness of sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Quoting people close to the process, Sky said insolvency experts have been placed on standby in case British Steel cannot secure the funds it needs. The BBC understands that nationalisation or a management buyout are also being discussed as fall-back options. The GMB union called on the government to guarantee the future of the firm and safeguard thousands of jobs. ""This government has a track record of sitting on its hands while UK manufacturing collapse round its ears,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""Now is the time to take action - ministers must come out and guarantee the loan required to safeguard British Steel."" Private equity firm Greybull Capital rescued Tata Steel's long products business - which makes steel for the rail and construction sectors - during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It paid a nominal Â£1 fee for the assets, but pledged to plough up to Â£400m into the business, which it rebranded British Steel. Workers had to take pay cuts and reductions in their pensions in return, and the company recently returned to profit. The news comes days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata said its UK business would keep running, but admitted it was facing tough operating conditions in the UK.

"Female unemployment rate lowest since 1971The female unemployment rate of 3.7% in the first quarter is the lowest since records began, the ONS said.BusinessComments","Britain's female unemployment rate in the first three months of the year has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalincluded the figure in data showing the overall unemployment rate in the three-month period stood at 3.8%, the lowest rate since late 1974. For men the rate was 3.9%, the lowest since mid 1975. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees rose by 3.3%. The ONS said that unemployment rates for both men and women have been falling since late 2013. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the unemployment figures were strong given the issues facing the economy. ""The UK labour market has been remarkably resilient in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty,"" he said. For January to March 2019, the ONS said 1.3 million people were unemployed, 119,000 fewer than for a year earlier and 914,000 fewer than for five years earlier. The overall unemployment rate of 3.8% in the first quarter was last matched in the three-month period from November 1974 to January 1975. It was last lower, at 3.7%, in October to December 1974. Over the last five years the unemployment rate for men has fallen from 7% to 3.9% and for women has shown a smaller fall over this period - from 6.4% to 3.7%. But this is the lowest level since 1971, when records began. The ONS said the increase in the employment rate for women is due partly to changes to the state pension age for women, so fewer women are retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The ONS added that total hours worked by women had increased while for men had stayed stable. This is because falls in the employment rate for men have been roughly offset by population increases. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the increased participation rate of women was part of ""a cultural change seen across developed economies"". It may also reflect higher wages attracting women and older workers into the workplace, he added. While average real wages - adjusted for inflation - were the highest since December 2010, the TUC said the rate of growth was slowing. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Pay growth is stalling again. The last thing workers need is another hit in the pocket when real wages are still lower than a decade ago"". Employment Minister Alok Sharma said the rise in wages and booming higher-skilled employment meant prospects for families were improving. ""We now need to shift some of our focus to up-skilling people and supporting them into roles with real career progression to create a modern workforce fit for the challenges of the 21st Century,"" he said. Not since Barry White's 'My first My last My everything' and 'Wombling Merry Christmas' were in the charts has the unemployment rate been lower (December 1974). And the rate of unemployment among women is now the lowest it's been since 1971 - try Janis Joplin's Mercedes Benz (Oh Lord). In both of those years, the official policy goal was to obtain full employment. And although inflation was higher in the 1970s, who wouldn't welcome the lowest unemployment since then? Well, to be a party-pooper, it's not like most of those women are going to be able to afford a Merc themselves. Wages have risen by 3.3%, 1.5% above inflation. But that's still only modest wage growth compared to the 1970s (when prices rose quickly, but wages mostly rose faster).  We're not getting better off as fast as we did back then. And back then, productivity - the amount each worker could produce - was on the rise. Now, according to the latest figures, it's dropped. Output per worker barely grew compared to a year before - up just 0.7%. That's not enough to fund the bigger pay rises. And at the same time, it's getting harder and harder to find the staff to meet orders. You may be able to afford what you want, but you may have to wait a little longer. Prof Geraint Johnes, at Lancaster University Management School, said the number of full-time employees fell in the quarter, which was offset by an increase in full-time self-employed workers and that the number of employees working part time also rose. ""Whether these shifts indicate a longer term increase in precarity will need to be monitored carefully over the coming months. The labour market seems now to be exhibiting signs of nervousness that, given present uncertainties, should not be surprising,"" Prof Johnes said. Mr Wishart noted that employment only rose by 99,000 during the period, driven by self-employment, while full-time employment fell by 55,000. ""Despite the unemployment rate edging down to a fresh 45-year low, March's figures painted a picture of a softening labour market,"" Mr Wishart said.

Man City could face Champions League banUefa investigators want Manchester City banned from the Champions League for a season if they are found guilty of breaking financial rules.BBC Sport,"Manchester City won the Premier League for the fourth time in eight seasons on Sunday Uefa investigators want Manchester City to be banned from the Champions League for a season if they are found guilty of breaking financial rules. However, according to one well-placed source, a final decision is yet to be made by chief investigator Yves Leterme. The former Belgian prime minister, chairman of the investigatory panel of Uefa's independent financial control board, is set to make a recommendation this week. With no vote in such cases, the final say lies with him but several of his colleagues are understood to have firmly expressed the view at a recent meeting that a season-long ban would be a suitable punishment if City are found guilty. Mahrez happy to fight for Manchester City place Premier League champions return home to celebrate title success This is my toughest title - Guardiola Manchester City lost to Tottenham in the Champions League quarter-finals this season and have never got past the semi-finals Leterme and his team have been looking at evidence first uncovered in a series of leaks published by the German newspaper Der Spiegel last year. The reports alleged that Manchester City had broken Financial Fair Play regulations by inflating the value of a multimillion-pound sponsorship deal. City were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. The Premier League champions denied any wrongdoing, and Uefa said it could not comment on an ongoing investigation, butaccording to the New York Times,,externalinvestigators now want rules upheld and City punished with a ban. Uefa's adjudicatory chamber would have to decide whether it agreed with any recommendation from Leterme - expected in the next 48 hours - although it is unlikely to apply to next season's competition because City could appeal, and even take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. But it would still be a major blow for a club desperate to win Europe's most prestigious club competition for the first time, and who could also soon face a transfer ban, with the FA, Premier League and Fifa also currently investigating City over their signing of youth players. A statement from Manchester City said: ""Manchester City FC is fully cooperating in good faith with the CFCB IC's [Club Financial Control Body Investigatory Chamber] ongoing investigation. ""In doing so the club is reliant on both the CFCB IC's independence and commitment to due process; and on Uefa's commitment of the 7 March that it 'will make no further comment on the matter while the investigation is ongoing'. ""The New York Times report citing 'people familiar with the case' is therefore extremely concerning. ""The implications are that either Manchester City's good faith in the CFCB IC is misplaced or the CFCB IC process is being misrepresented by individuals intent on damaging the club's reputation and its commercial interests. Or both. ""Manchester City's published accounts are full and complete and a matter of legal and regulatory record. The accusation of financial irregularities are entirely false, and comprehensive proof of this fact has been provided to the CFCB IC."" FFP rules - all you need to know Financial Fair Play wasintroduced by Uefa,externalto prevent clubs in its competitions from spending beyond their means and stamp out what its then president Michel Platini called ""financial doping"" within football. Under the rules, financial losses are limited and clubs are also obliged to meet all their transfer and employee payment commitments at all times. Clubs need to balance football-related expenditure - transfers and wages - with television and ticket income, plus revenues raised by their commercial departments. Money spent on stadiums, training facilities, youth development or community projects is exempt. The Club Financial Control Body, set up by Uefa, has the ultimate sanction of banning clubs from Uefa competitions, with other potential punishments including warnings, fines, withholding prize money, transfer bans, points deductions, a ban on registration of new players and a restriction on the number of players who can be registered for Uefa competitions. In 2014, Qatar-owned Paris St-Germain received a similar financial punishment to the one City received. PSG weredeemed to have breached FFP ruleswhen the CFCB decided their back-dated Â£167m sponsorship contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority, which wiped out their losses, had an unfair value. That meant the French side exceeded allowed financial losses by a wide margin when, under FFP rules, clubs were limited to losses of Â£37m over the previous two years. They received a fine, a spending cap and were only allowed to register 21 players for the Champions League for a season. PSG alsoremain under investigationfor their 2017-18 finances when they signed Neymar from Barcelona for a world record Â£222m euros (Â£200m) and Kylian Mbappe from Monaco, initially on loan, for 180m euros (Â£165.7m).

The former Belgian prime minister, chairman of the investigatory panel of Uefa's independent financial control board, is set to make a recommendation this week. With no vote in such cases, the final say lies with him but several of his colleagues are understood to have firmly expressed the view at a recent meeting that a season-long ban would be a suitable punishment if City are found guilty. Mahrez happy to fight for Manchester City place Premier League champions return home to celebrate title success This is my toughest title - Guardiola Manchester City lost to Tottenham in the Champions League quarter-finals this season and have never got past the semi-finals Leterme and his team have been looking at evidence first uncovered in a series of leaks published by the German newspaper Der Spiegel last year. The reports alleged that Manchester City had broken Financial Fair Play regulations by inflating the value of a multimillion-pound sponsorship deal. City were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. The Premier League champions denied any wrongdoing, and Uefa said it could not comment on an ongoing investigation, butaccording to the New York Times,,externalinvestigators now want rules upheld and City punished with a ban. Uefa's adjudicatory chamber would have to decide whether it agreed with any recommendation from Leterme - expected in the next 48 hours - although it is unlikely to apply to next season's competition because City could appeal, and even take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. But it would still be a major blow for a club desperate to win Europe's most prestigious club competition for the first time, and who could also soon face a transfer ban, with the FA, Premier League and Fifa also currently investigating City over their signing of youth players. A statement from Manchester City said: ""Manchester City FC is fully cooperating in good faith with the CFCB IC's [Club Financial Control Body Investigatory Chamber] ongoing investigation. ""In doing so the club is reliant on both the CFCB IC's independence and commitment to due process; and on Uefa's commitment of the 7 March that it 'will make no further comment on the matter while the investigation is ongoing'. ""The New York Times report citing 'people familiar with the case' is therefore extremely concerning. ""The implications are that either Manchester City's good faith in the CFCB IC is misplaced or the CFCB IC process is being misrepresented by individuals intent on damaging the club's reputation and its commercial interests. Or both. ""Manchester City's published accounts are full and complete and a matter of legal and regulatory record. The accusation of financial irregularities are entirely false, and comprehensive proof of this fact has been provided to the CFCB IC."" FFP rules - all you need to know Financial Fair Play wasintroduced by Uefa,externalto prevent clubs in its competitions from spending beyond their means and stamp out what its then president Michel Platini called ""financial doping"" within football. Under the rules, financial losses are limited and clubs are also obliged to meet all their transfer and employee payment commitments at all times. Clubs need to balance football-related expenditure - transfers and wages - with television and ticket income, plus revenues raised by their commercial departments. Money spent on stadiums, training facilities, youth development or community projects is exempt. The Club Financial Control Body, set up by Uefa, has the ultimate sanction of banning clubs from Uefa competitions, with other potential punishments including warnings, fines, withholding prize money, transfer bans, points deductions, a ban on registration of new players and a restriction on the number of players who can be registered for Uefa competitions. In 2014, Qatar-owned Paris St-Germain received a similar financial punishment to the one City received. PSG weredeemed to have breached FFP ruleswhen the CFCB decided their back-dated Â£167m sponsorship contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority, which wiped out their losses, had an unfair value. That meant the French side exceeded allowed financial losses by a wide margin when, under FFP rules, clubs were limited to losses of Â£37m over the previous two years. They received a fine, a spending cap and were only allowed to register 21 players for the Champions League for a season. PSG alsoremain under investigationfor their 2017-18 finances when they signed Neymar from Barcelona for a world record Â£222m euros (Â£200m) and Kylian Mbappe from Monaco, initially on loan, for 180m euros (Â£165.7m).

British Steel seeks loan for 'Brexit issues'The steelmaker says it is seeking another government loan amid reports it is close to administration.BusinessComments,"British Steel's Scunthorpe plant British Steel has said it is seeking further financial support from the government to help it address ""Brexit-related issues"". It follows reports the company needs a loan of up to Â£75m to keep trading in the coming months. The UK's second largest steel firm employs 4,500 people, and about 20,000â indirectly via its supply chain. The company said ""uncertainties around Brexit are posing challenges for all businesses including British Steel"". It added: ""We are holding constructive discussions with our stakeholders on how to navigate them. ""Discussions are continuing about a package of additional support to assist the company address broader Brexit-related issues, whilst continuing with [the company's] investment plans."" A spokesperson for the the Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy said: ""As this is speculation, we won't be commenting."" British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has sites in Teesside, Cumbria and North Yorkshire. The move comes just two weeks afterBritish Steel secured a Â£100m loan from the governmentto pay its EU carbon bill. The money meant the private equity-owned firm could avoid a steep EU fine. According to Sky News,external, in recent days the steel maker has met its lenders and the government to discuss another loan. British Steel has reportedly faced a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has also been struggling with the prolonged weakness of sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Quoting people close to the process, Sky said insolvency experts have been placed on standby in case British Steel cannot secure the funds it needs. The BBC understands that nationalisation or a management buyout are also being discussed as fall-back options. The GMB union called on the government to guarantee the future of the firm and safeguard thousands of jobs. ""This government has a track record of sitting on its hands while UK manufacturing collapse round its ears,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""Now is the time to take action - ministers must come out and guarantee the loan required to safeguard British Steel."" Private equity firm Greybull Capital rescued Tata Steel's long products business - which makes steel for the rail and construction sectors - during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It paid a nominal Â£1 fee for the assets, but pledged to plough up to Â£400m into the business, which it rebranded British Steel. Workers had to take pay cuts and reductions in their pensions in return, and the company recently returned to profit. The news comes days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata said its UK business would keep running, but admitted it was facing tough operating conditions in the UK.

Scottish jobless total continues to fall,"Scottish unemployment continued to fall in the three months to March, according to official figures. The jobless total fell by 7,000 from the previous quarter to reach 89,000. The unemployment rate is now at 3.2%, compared with the UK figure of 3.8%. Employment among Scots of working age fell by 3,000 to just under 2.6 million - an employment rate of 75.4%. UK employment jumped by 99,000 to 32.7 million - the third highest total since records began in 1971. According to the Office for National Statistics,unemployment in the UK as a whole fell by 65,000during the latest quarter to 1.3 million, continuing a general trend which started in early 2012. The UK's unemployment rate is now lower than at any time since late 1974. For men the rate was 3.9% - it has not been lower since March to May 1975 - and for women it was 3.7%, the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees rose by 3.3%. Responding to the figures, Scotland's Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said the Scottish economy and jobs market continued to strengthen.

Inequality driving 'deaths of despair',"Widening inequalities in pay, health and opportunities in the UK are undermining trust in democracy, says an Institute for Fiscal Studies report. The think tank warns of runaway incomes for high earners but rises in ""deaths of despair"", such as from addiction and suicide, among the poorest. It warns of risks to ""centre-ground"" politics from stagnating pay and divides in health and education. The report says such widening gaps are ""making a mockery of democracy"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country's leading research institutes, is launching what it says is the UK's biggest analysis of inequality. That will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Prof Sir Angus Deaton. He said ""people were troubled by inequality"" more than at any time since the 1940s - and the impact was so serious that it suggested ""democratic capitalism is broken"". He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work - and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by ""taking rather than making"". Sir Angus said ""people getting rich is a good thing"" but not if it meant ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"". Report author Sir Angus Deaton: Nobel laureate expert on poverty Middle classes losing out to ultra rich Half of children born into families renting British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' A third of millennials face renting their entire lives At the outset of this review, the IFS has published indicators of inequality - such as the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now earning 145 times the average salary, up from 47 times in 1998. It suggests pay inequality in the UK is high by international standards - with the share of household income going to the richest 1% having tripled in the past three decades. The middle classes are also under pressure, particularly younger generations, with stagnant pay and unaffordable house prices. The long-term decline in trade union membership is identified as another factor in wages not increasing. As well as inequality in income, the think tank highlights divergence in health. It says there is almost a 10-year gap in male life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas - and the IFS warns of ""deaths of despair"", with a rise in early deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and suicide being linked to factors such as poverty, social isolation and mental health problems. Patterns of relationship are also affected by inequality, the study suggests. Over recent decades, wealthier people have become more likely to be living in a couple, either married or co-habiting, the IFS says. But among the poor, declining numbers are living with a partner, a pattern attributed to increasing job insecurity, a lack of financial independence and more ""chaotic lives"". The big picture, says the IFS, is the UK is becoming more like the US, with a concentration of wealth at the top and pressure on working families lower down the pay scale. This video can not be played 'Inequality of political voice is even worse', says Prof Sir Angus Deaton It says that in the US, increases in life expectancy have stalled and that for non-graduate male workers, pay has not risen in real terms for five decades. ""The risk is that the UK may follow a similar path,"" says the IFS study. The IFS warns of the social tensions that will come with an economic landscape built on widening inequality. As economic think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported recently, this is likely to putpressure on the middle classesas well as those on low incomes. James Hutchinson says if people do not feel they are making progress, they become ""disconnected"" University science researcher James Hutchinson, in his 30s, feels he has kept his side of the bargain - gaining a degree from Cambridge - and now working as an academic as well as raising a family with his partner. But he feels a sense of ""powerlessness"" about the cost of housing and that his work has no job security, with a series of short-term contracts. ""It's not a sob story,"" says Dr Hutchinson, ""But if people feel they can't improve their lot, then they feel disconnected."" ""We were sold the idea that academic success is the way to be better off,"" he says. His partner Bethany has decided not to work because she can't afford childcare. She says ""for me as a parent, I didn't feel comfortable with us being separated... and then working all hours."" Bethany and her partner James Hutchinson have struggled to make ends meet for their family They live in Bristol and struggled to get somewhere they could afford to live - currently the family all sleep in one room while they patch up their home. Dr Hutchinson recognises that he's ""more privileged than many"" - earning the average for UK graduates of Â£35,000 per year - but he voices a frustration at a lack of progress and fears that things could get even worse for his children. The ""disconnect"" comes, he says, from his generation becoming ""increasingly aware of your own expendability"" and a work culture haunted by a ""constant lack of security"". Dr Hutchinson is sceptical that any of the political rhetoric will translate into real improvements. ""How do we build a functional society out of dysfunctional lives?"" he asks. The consumer society is afraid of becoming the consumed.

PM's negotiator to explore Brexit changes,"Chief negotiator Olly Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the political declaration Theresa May's Brexit negotiator has gone to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU. Olly Robbins is looking to see whether a key demand being made by Labour in cross-party talks can be satisfied. But as cabinet discussed the state of the talks, Theresa May faced calls from senior Conservative MPs not to agree a compromise with Jeremy Corbyn. Ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the process was a ""blind alley"". The Labour leader is also facing demands from his MPs to abandon the talks, which have been going on for more than a month with little apparent progress. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Cross-party deal must include new referendum - Sir Keir Starmer What's in the political declaration? Labour negotiators want any deal they strike with minister to be reflected in changes to the political declaration made with Brussels. This 27-page document was published alongside Mrs May's withdrawal agreement and sets out the parameters for the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but is not legally binding. In Brussels, Mr Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the declaration if the government and Labour can come to an agreement. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said officials were currently on a ""Brexit break"", but would come out of it ""if there is something happening in London"". ""We will listen to Olly Robbins tomorrow,"" she added. Meanwhile, in Westminster, the cabinet has been taking stock of progress so far in the talks, while Labour's shadow cabinet will meet later to discuss the state of play. Cabinet are discussing the state of the Brexit talks Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, and 13 former cabinet ministers have written to Mrs May to warn her not to agree a compromise with Labour that includes a customs union with the EU. Insidea customs unionthere would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between the UK and other EU nations - something that is seen as advantageous for business. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, and for some, that fails to satisfy the desire for a clean break with Brussels after Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? Among the former cabinet ministers are Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and sacked defence secretary Gavin Williamson, as well as Maria Miller and Sir Michael Fallon, who supported Remain in the 2016 referendum. According to the Times,external, the letter said such a compromise would lose the support of Conservatives who previously backed the prime minister's deal, and would be unlikely to gain enough Labour votes to pass. It said: ""More fundamentally, you would have lost the loyal middle of the Conservative Party, split our party and with likely nothing positive to show for it. No leader can [bind] his or her successor, so the deal would likely be at best temporary, at worst illusory."" Sir Michael said the government's focus should be on addressing Conservative and Democratic Unionist Party concerns over the Northern Irish border and finding alternative arrangements tothe backstop,not doing a deal with Labour. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""The talks are clearly not going anywhere. ""If they are going to include permanent membership of a customs union then frankly we would be better off staying in the EU then we would have a voice in the trade arrangements that are being negotiated. ""We can't say we are leaving the EU then half stay in it."" Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. ""Both sides agree that no Parliament can bind a future government and most EU trade deals have a six to 12-month exit clause.""

British Steel has reportedly faced a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has also been struggling with the prolonged weakness of sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Quoting people close to the process, Sky said insolvency experts have been placed on standby in case British Steel cannot secure the funds it needs. The BBC understands that nationalisation or a management buyout are also being discussed as fall-back options. The GMB union called on the government to guarantee the future of the firm and safeguard thousands of jobs. ""This government has a track record of sitting on its hands while UK manufacturing collapse round its ears,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""Now is the time to take action - ministers must come out and guarantee the loan required to safeguard British Steel."" Private equity firm Greybull Capital rescued Tata Steel's long products business - which makes steel for the rail and construction sectors - during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It paid a nominal Â£1 fee for the assets, but pledged to plough up to Â£400m into the business, which it rebranded British Steel. Workers had to take pay cuts and reductions in their pensions in return, and the company recently returned to profit. The news comes days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata said its UK business would keep running, but admitted it was facing tough operating conditions in the UK.

Vodafone to launch 5G UK service in JulyThe firm will offer its next-generation mobile network to businesses and the public in seven cities.Technology,"Vodafone has said that it will turn on its 5G service in the UK on 3 July. The company will rely on equipment from the Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, among others, to deliver the service. It is the first firm to confirm a UK switch-on date, and both business customers and consumers will be able to sign up. Vodafone said the benefits of the next-generation mobile network would include faster and more reliable data speeds for customers in busy areas. The UK government is still carrying out a review of the telecoms sector that has the potential to restrict or even block the use of Huawei's kit to address cyber-security concerns. However,a leak last month indicatedthat network providers will indeed be allowed to use Huawei's radio access network (Ran) gear, which allows smartphones and other devices to wirelessly connect to their systems. Vodafone has said seven cities will be involved in the initial roll-out: Birmingham Bristol Cardiff Glasgow Manchester Liverpool London ""Offering speeds over 5G up to 10 times faster than 4G, we've shown commuters at busy airports and railway stations that they can download TV box sets or movies in a matter of seconds before they embark on their journey,""Vodafone added in a press release,external.

That should help pave the way towards the wider use of data-gathering sensors, which in turn should help public authorities and businesses make better informed-decisions. But it is likely to take years or even decades for the technology's full potential to be harnessed. Vodafone has said it would reveal details of its 5G price plans next week.

Vodafone also uses 5G Ran kit purchased from Ericsson, so is not totally reliant on the Chinese company's products. But a ban would involve it having to strip out existing Huawei equipment already used to deliver its 4G services, which Vodafone has said would be a major undertaking and take up much of its engineering resources.

Female unemployment rate lowest since 1971,"Britain's female unemployment rate in the first three months of the year has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalincluded the figure in data showing the overall unemployment rate in the three-month period stood at 3.8%, the lowest rate since late 1974. For men the rate was 3.9%, the lowest since mid 1975. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees rose by 3.3%. The ONS said that unemployment rates for both men and women have been falling since late 2013. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the unemployment figures were strong given the issues facing the economy. ""The UK labour market has been remarkably resilient in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty,"" he said. For January to March 2019, the ONS said 1.3 million people were unemployed, 119,000 fewer than for a year earlier and 914,000 fewer than for five years earlier. The overall unemployment rate of 3.8% in the first quarter was last matched in the three-month period from November 1974 to January 1975. It was last lower, at 3.7%, in October to December 1974. Over the last five years the unemployment rate for men has fallen from 7% to 3.9% and for women has shown a smaller fall over this period - from 6.4% to 3.7%. But this is the lowest level since 1971, when records began. The ONS said the increase in the employment rate for women is due partly to changes to the state pension age for women, so fewer women are retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The ONS added that total hours worked by women had increased while for men had stayed stable. This is because falls in the employment rate for men have been roughly offset by population increases. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the increased participation rate of women was part of ""a cultural change seen across developed economies"". It may also reflect higher wages attracting women and older workers into the workplace, he added. While average real wages - adjusted for inflation - were the highest since December 2010, the TUC said the rate of growth was slowing. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Pay growth is stalling again. The last thing workers need is another hit in the pocket when real wages are still lower than a decade ago"". Employment Minister Alok Sharma said the rise in wages and booming higher-skilled employment meant prospects for families were improving. ""We now need to shift some of our focus to up-skilling people and supporting them into roles with real career progression to create a modern workforce fit for the challenges of the 21st Century,"" he said. Not since Barry White's 'My first My last My everything' and 'Wombling Merry Christmas' were in the charts has the unemployment rate been lower (December 1974). And the rate of unemployment among women is now the lowest it's been since 1971 - try Janis Joplin's Mercedes Benz (Oh Lord). In both of those years, the official policy goal was to obtain full employment. And although inflation was higher in the 1970s, who wouldn't welcome the lowest unemployment since then? Well, to be a party-pooper, it's not like most of those women are going to be able to afford a Merc themselves. Wages have risen by 3.3%, 1.5% above inflation. But that's still only modest wage growth compared to the 1970s (when prices rose quickly, but wages mostly rose faster).  We're not getting better off as fast as we did back then. And back then, productivity - the amount each worker could produce - was on the rise. Now, according to the latest figures, it's dropped. Output per worker barely grew compared to a year before - up just 0.7%. That's not enough to fund the bigger pay rises. And at the same time, it's getting harder and harder to find the staff to meet orders. You may be able to afford what you want, but you may have to wait a little longer. Prof Geraint Johnes, at Lancaster University Management School, said the number of full-time employees fell in the quarter, which was offset by an increase in full-time self-employed workers and that the number of employees working part time also rose. ""Whether these shifts indicate a longer term increase in precarity will need to be monitored carefully over the coming months. The labour market seems now to be exhibiting signs of nervousness that, given present uncertainties, should not be surprising,"" Prof Johnes said. Mr Wishart noted that employment only rose by 99,000 during the period, driven by self-employment, while full-time employment fell by 55,000. ""Despite the unemployment rate edging down to a fresh 45-year low, March's figures painted a picture of a softening labour market,"" Mr Wishart said.

Former youth football coach admits abuse,"Jim McCafferty leaves court after his sentencing A former youth coach involved in Scottish football has been given a further jail sentence after admitting a series of child sex abuse crimes. Jim McCafferty, 73, was a coach and kit man for the Celtic youth team who also worked for Celtic Boys Club. In court, he admitted 12 charges related to child sex abuse against 10 teenage boys between 1972 and 1996. He was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. He was already serving a jail term for abuse. Last year he washe was found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy in Belfast. In relation to the latest charges, most of his victims played for youth teams he ran in North Lanarkshire. The abuser who preyed on dreams of football stardom Four played for Celtic Boys Club and Celtic youth team. They were aged between 14 and 17. The incidents took place in several locations across Scotland - including team showers, hotel rooms and minibuses. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that among the complainers were former professional footballers. Jim McCafferty was already serving a jail term after a trial in Northern Ireland Some of his victims developed alcohol and mental health problems as a consequence of the abuse he subjected them too. Judge Lord Beckett said McCafferty was ""physically intimidating"" and used his ""overpowering"" nature to achieve his ""depraved objectives"" of abusing young boys. He added: ""You took advantage of your position of trust as a football coach to groom and then sexually abuse boys who played for your teams. ""You were adept at identifying the circumstances of different boys so that you could manipulate them and in some cases their parents in a variety of ways. ""All of this was done to facilitate your sexually abusing children."" He added: ""Careers did not reach their full potential, some were cut short and lives have been seriously blighted. Many of those that you abused have suffered from enduring anxiety and depression caused by what you did. ""Conduct of this kind has a wider effect which is corrupting and socially corrosive. It has the potential to undermine the trust which people place in youth football and sports clubs."" McCafferty's lawyer told the court he wanted to apologise to his victims and their families. He is the fourth man connected to either Celtic or Celtic Boys Club to be found guilty of historical child sex abuse in the past year. Both Jim Torbett (left) and Frank Cairney (right) have been convicted of abusing children at Celtic Boys Club Last NovemberCeltic Boys Club founder Jim Tobett was jailedfor six years for sexually abusing three boys over eight years. Earlier this year, the boys club's former chairman,Gerald King, was given a three-year probation orderfor sexually abusing four boys and a girl in the 1980s. And in FebruaryFrank Cairney, a former manager of the boys club, was jailed for four yearsafter being convicted of nine charges of sexually abusing young footballers. Outside court, Det Ch Insp Sarah Taylor said McCafferty exploited his position to satisfy his own ""sexual depravity"". She paid tribute to the victims who ""lived in fear as boys"", but found the courage and strength to speak out as adults. ""They were listened to and without their testimony we would not be here today witnessing McCafferty's long awaited admissions of guilt,"" she said. ""The scale of his abuse is unprecedented, and demonstrates the systematic and calculated methods he used to target his victims. ""Whether as a respected coach or an affable kit man, he used every opportunity available to perpetrate his callous abuse."" Patrick McGuire, of Thompsons Solicitors, is representing some of McCafferty's victims in civil cases. He called for action from Celtic Football Club. ""McCafferty's connection with Celtic is now utterly undeniable,"" he said. ""We now know that some of the abuse took place in Celtic premises. What he did was groom the boys but at the same time groom the parents, always with Celtic dangling on the end of a stick as a golden carrot. It's just utterly unforgivable. ""McCafferty's conviction is probably the last conviction that we'll see in a Celtic setting. But what's never happened is any form of financial justice for the survivors of abuse at Celtic Park and that's why now all eyes are on the board of Celtic Football Club to do the right thing.""

How to stay safe on WhatsApp,"The phrase ""WhatsApp targeted attack"" is something no WhatsApp user wants to seein a headline. Add in ""hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software"" and the company's PR department have got a big day on their hands. WhatsApp says a small number of accounts were attacked by ""an advanced cyber actor"". But if that entirely normal phrase hasn't quite put you at ease, here are a few tips to help keep your information safe. According to our stock image library, this is what cyber attackers look like The attack was first discovered earlier this month. At the time Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, told security specialists the issue was: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP [voice over internet protocol] stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP [secure real-time transport protocol] packets sent to a target phone number."" Cool. Let us roughly translate - attackers used WhatsApp's voice call function to ring a target's device. Even if the call wasn't picked up, the surveillance software could still be installed because of that ""vulnerable VOIP"" not being secure enough. The call then may have disappeared from the device's call log because hackers had control of the app. Updates on most social media apps include security improvements And no, the fix isn't just a case of turning your phone off and on again. On Monday, WhatsApp suggested its 1.5 billion users update the app after rolling out a fix to help protect devices from cyber attacks. You'll have to do this one manually so that little red dot hovering above App Store (or whatever your phone does to give you a passive-aggressive nudge) isn't going to take care of itself this time. Even though messages in WhatsApp areend-to-end encrypted, which means they should only appear on the sender or recipient's device, the surveillance software used in the latest hack would have let an attacker read the target's messages. It's probably best to keep on top of all your app updates as they often include tweaks to security. Dark room, green numbers on a screen. Classic hacker. You probably know about end-to-end encryption - one of the biggest appeals of WhatsApp. But if you - or your friends - back up your WhatsApp chats to a service like Google Drive or iCloud, there is a flaw. That back-up is not protected by end-to-end encryption, so anyone with access to your cloud could get hold of your chat history. So if you really care about privacy, then that's something you might want to disable. You might get the odd prompt asking how often you want backups - but if you want to change it now then head to the Chat Backup area of your settings. You're not fooling anyone with that sinister hoodie and no face, pal If your app supports it (which WhatsApp does), two-factor authentication (2FA) is a good way to help keep data safe. This is an extra layer of security to make sure people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they'll be required to provide a finger print, a voice command, or a code texted to your mobile device for example. Sometimes it's some extra information. You know the drill: first pet, mother's maiden name - those guys. Again you can change two-step verification in your settings in WhatsApp. If your device looks like this - you've gone too far WhatsApp (and loads of other apps) offers a range of security and privacy control. Go to Settings > Account > Privacy to see everything at your disposal. From there you can control who can see your ""last seen"", profile photo and live location. You can also turn off read receipts here, so the blue check marks are switched off. You can go for all or none of those depending on who you want to let see various aspects of your chats.

WhatsApp sets new rules amid mob killings,"Many Indians are first exposed to the internet through low-cost smartphones WhatsApp has said it will limit how many times messages can be forwarded in India, to curb the spread of false information on its platform. The announcement comes after a spate of mob lynchings were linked to messages that circulated on WhatsApp groups. The government on Thursday reissued a warning to the company that it could face legal consequences if it remained a ""mute spectator"". With more than 200 million users, India is WhatsApp's biggest market. WhatsApp said its users in India ""forward more messages, photos, and videos, than any other country in the world"". Groups on WhatsApp can have a maximum of 256 people. Many of the messages that are believed to have triggered violence were forwarded to multiple groups which had more than 100 members each. In a blog published on its website,the company announced that it was ""launching a test to limit forwarding that will apply to everyone using WhatsApp"",external. For Indian users, however, the forwarding option will be limited even further. A WhatsApp spokesperson told the BBC that this means a single person would be able to forward one message only five times. However, this does not stop other members from a group from forwarding the message to a further five chats of their own. WhatsApp added that they hoped this measure would curb the frequency of messages being forwarded. The company also said it would be removing the ""quick forward button"" next to messages containing pictures or video. Who can stop India WhatsApp lynchings? How WhatsApp helped turn an Indian village into a lynch mob India 'WhatsApp child abduction rumours': Five more lynched These changes come in the wake of a series of mob lynchings that have seen at least 18 people killed across India since April 2018. Media reports put the number of dead higher. The violence has been blamed on rumours of child kidnappings, spread over WhatsApp, which have led people to attack strangers. Police say it is proving hard to get people to believe that the messages are false. In a recent lynching in the north-eastern state of Tripura, the victim was a man employed by the local government to go around villages to dispel rumours being spread on social media. India's federal government had earlier warned WhatsApp, a Facebook-owned company, that it could not evade ""accountability and responsibility"" for the content its users were sharing. This video can not be played The India WhatsApp video driving people to murder WhatsApp had responded by saying it was ""horrified by these terrible acts of violence"", and that the situation was a ""challenge that requires government, civil society and technology companies to work together"". The messaging app is the single largest internet-based service available to people in India. It has tremendous reach, allowing messages to spread exponentially and enabling mobs to gather quickly. Earlier this month,the company outlined steps it was taking to help address the problem, which included enabling users to leave groups and block people more easily.

Who cracked the iPhone?,"The NSO Group boasted about being able to work without ""a trace"" What do we know about the curious, secretive NSO Group? Very little - but after this week, an awful lot more than we did before. The group, an Israeli-based but American-owned company, specialises in creating what it calls tools against crime and terrorism. But the security researchers call them something else: a cyber arms dealer. On Thursday, the NSO Group was thrust into international headlines after being credited with creating malicious software capable of ""jailbreaking"" any iPhone with just one tap of the screen, and then installing vicious spyware. Founded in 2010 and has had several different names Based in Herzliya, Israel, and owned by US investment firm Francisco Partners Could be worth $1bn Security-savvy human rights lawyer Ahmed Mansoor found himself targeted by the attack when his iPhone received a message promising ""secrets"" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates. Had he tapped on the link, the phone would have been plundered. Huge amounts of private data: text messages, photos, emails, location data, even whatâs being picked up by the deviceâs microphone and camera. Thankfully, he didn't do that. Instead, he passed on the message to experts at Citizen Lab and Lookout, who peeled back the covers on what they described as one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever discovered. With it came evidence that it was the NSO Groupâs expertise at the heart of it all. Earlier this year, UK-based watchdog Privacy International launched a database tracking the global trade of cyber arms. Its intention was to track deals between cyber arms companies and governments. According to the Surveillance Industry Index (SII), the NSO Group was founded in 2010 and is based in Herzliya, an attractive city north of Tel Aviv that is known as being a cluster of tech start-ups. The group was likely funded by the elite 8200 Intelligence Unit, an Israeli military-funded scheme for start-ups. According to Forbes, the8200 Intelligence Unit was heavily involved,externalin providing expertise and funding forStuxnet, a cyber attack on Iran that was a joint operation between the US and Israel. The texts had been sent to human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor Listed in the SSI were multi-million dollar deals made between the NSO Group and government entities in Mexico and Panama. This is the tip of the iceberg - âpress reports of sales rely on leaks and anonymous sources, and so there are likely many more unknown to the general public. In 2015, the NSO Groupâs owners - âUS-based venture capital firm Francisco Partnersâ - were looking to sell the company at a value of around $1bn. Neither firm has responded to the BBCâs requests for further comment. That the NSO Group sells tools to governments is no secretâ - âin a statement released in response to claims it was behind the attack on Mr Mansoor, NSO Group spokesman Zamir Dahbash said: ""The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations."" But the company has gone no further than that in describing who its customers are, and what exactly they buy. It does say it has no control over how its tools are used and for what purpose. Whatever the origin of the NSO Group, what has been created is an extraordinarily talented team of cyber specialists. The attack on Mr Mansoor, had it worked, would have utilised not one but three zero day attacks. A ""zero day"" is a term given to vulnerabilities that were previously unknown to the security industry, and are therefore wide open to attack. To discover one zero day is rare, to find three is outstanding. Clues to the origin of the attack came when the experts looked at the messages Mr Mansoor received. A link was included to a web domain known to point to servers set up by the NSO Group for its customers. When the researchers analysed the spywareâs code, they noticed apparent references to ""Pegasus"", the name given, by the NSO Group, to one of its spying products. Details about Pegasus were made public last year when another cyber arms firm, called the Hacking Team, was itself breached. Material used to market Pegasus was subsequently leaked. When Apple was made aware of the vulnerabilities in its iPhone, it acted quickly, patching the problem in 10 days and pushing out an update to all of its users. That has neutralised this specific attack, sure, but there'll likely be many more that remain hidden from view. In a rare interview with Defense News, the NSO Groupâs co-founder, Omri Lavie, said their attacks would ""leave no trace"". Thanks to the quick thinking of Mr Mansoor, and the forensic efforts of researchers, the group has been temporarily dragged into the limelight - but it will only be for a brief moment. Soon the NSO Group  will rejoin the rest of the money-spinning cyber arms trade back in the shadows.

'Weaponised' in Brazil poll,"Political campaigners in Brazil have used software that scrapes Facebook for citizens' phone numbers, and then automatically sends them WhatsApp messages and adds them to WhatsApp groups. Almost three weeks ago, 147 million voters in the country went to the polls for legislative elections and the first round of the presidential elections. This Sunday, they will decide between far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro and the left-wing Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad, in the second round of the presidential election. A BBC investigation has discovered that efforts to support various parties and candidates - covering state, federal and senate votes - have used the bulk message technique. WhatsApp is not just used as a private messaging app in Brazil. Many mobile phone networks allow unlimited WhatsApp access to subscribers, so even people who cannot afford an internet plan can use it. As a result, the platform has taken on some of the roles filled by social networks in other countries. Many people join interest-based WhatsApp groups to talk about politics and hobbies with people they have not met. WhatsApp claims 120 million Brazilians currently use its service. It is commonly used to share news - and misinformation. Some of the devices involved in the data scraping can send up to 300,000 messages at a time. They are sold via the internet and some sellers claim their use is hard to trace. The method is not limited to politics. Marketeers have also used it to promote cosmetics and foods, among other products, to Brazilians. BBC News Brasil interviewed people linked to different campaigns, on condition of anonymity. They included activists and marketeers, who reported how they used the scraping and bulk-messaging tools. In addition, the team spoke to companies selling the software as well as to people who had recently been added to politically linked WhatsApp groups without their consent. The scheme violates WhatsApp-owner Facebook's rules. In the view of some experts, it could also constitute an electoral crime. For its part, Facebook says it has banned hundreds of thousands of suspicious WhatsApp accounts and closed several Facebook pages and accounts linked to a marketing group believed to be supportive of Bolsonaro. The scraping software allows its clients to choose a target audience by searching for keywords, pages or public groups on Facebook. In fewer than 10 minutes and 10 clicks, it is possible to gather almost 1,000 phone numbers. Data can be group by city, gender and interests. Contacts can also be gathered by: using details voluntarily provided by a candidate's supporters buying databases sold legally in Brazil using information stolen or bought illegally from telephone service providers One woman in the Sao Paulo neighbourhood of Grajau remembers discovering that she had been added to four WhatsApp groups. ""I don't know where they found my phone number,"" the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""The administrators and some people had foreign numbers. I got scared, I left all of the groups and reported all of them to WhatsApp."" She added that after a day or two, she was added to a further eight groups. She said she had not provided her number to any political campaign, but had made it public on Facebook. Fighting Brazil's election on WhatsApp The secret world of Brazil's WhatsApp abortions Brazil general elections 2018 A 23-year-old university student living in Campinas reported having been added to three groups, in which four individuals dominated the conversation. ""They sent dozens of memes and videos against PT (the Workers' Party) every day,"" said the young man who also asked not to be named. ""Other people were sending lots of content too, and it was crazy."" Bulk WhatsAppmessaging Luiz Rodrigues Junior, of Agency Genius Publicidade, is one marketeer who acknowledged having tested adding people to WhatsApp groups in order to distribute political messages in bulk. But he said he had only used databases that had been legally compiled, and had opted not to pursue the strategy because it was not efficient. He declined to reveal which candidates he had acted on behalf of. ""I can't create a group that [explicitly] supports my candidate because that may expose him, people may attack him in the group and I'll have no control over it,"" he explained. ""So we set up election groups, with names like 'End corruption in the election', invited a lot of people through the software and put them in the group. ""Half of those who were added left and half stayed. ""Within this group, we placed two or three of our own professionals, who began to post content supporting our case and started debates. ""Then we would replicate this in many other groups, maybe 50 or 100."" In some cases, groups could be limited to residents of a neighbourhood who were facing a specific problem for which his candidate offered a solution, he said. But he explained that to make the strategy work he would have required an army of employees to keep discussions on track. How dobulk messagingprograms work? The mass delivery of WhatsApp messages generally involves the use of ""click farms"". But some services do not require special equipment any more, just Sim card details to be entered into a computer running relevant software. Several strategies are employed to avoid detection. One trick is to list the telephone numbers being used in ads posted to classified sites. When members of the public try to contact them, they ""legitimise"" the numbers and fool WhatsApp's bot detectors. Because the market is relatively new, the price, structure, and complexity of the tools vary greatly. In the interior of Sao Paulo state, for example, it is possible to find services that sell a package of one million WhatsApp messages for the equivalent of Â£6,200. WhatsApplimits In WhatsApp, each user can be a member of as many groups as he or she wants, but there are some limits. One is that each member can only create up to 9,999 groups. Another is the number of messages forwarded simultaneously to different conversations. This was reduced from 256 to 20 in August as part of efforts to tackle fake news. Some researchers are now calling for the number to be further reduced. They point to India, where the limit has been cut to five. But WhatsApp has said there would not be enough time to make the change before the weekend's vote. ""We have advanced spam detection technology that identifies accounts with abnormal behaviour so they cannot be used to spread spam or misinformation,"" said a statement from WhatsApp. ""We are also taking immediate legal action to prevent companies from sending bulk messages via WhatsApp and have already banned accounts associated with these companies."" Brazil's Electoral Court said that ""there is no specific electoral legislation for WhatsApp"" or similar apps, but added that the law does cover electoral advertising via the internet. But part of the problem with applying this to WhatsApp is its use of end-to-end encryption, explained one expert at the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). ""The content is not on the platform's servers, but on users' devices,"" said Prof Carlos Affonso Souza. And because WhatsApp cannot unscramble the encrypted messages itself to read them, it is unable to vet the content in the same way other social media platforms can, he added. ""I'm afraid that this debate will make us return to discussions of blocking the application or forcing it to give up its cryptography.""

"Former youth football coach admits abuseJim McCafferty, who worked with the Celtic youth team and Celtic Boys Club, abused teenage boys over 26 years.","Jim McCafferty leaves court after his sentencing A former youth coach involved in Scottish football has been given a further jail sentence after admitting a series of child sex abuse crimes. Jim McCafferty, 73, was a coach and kit man for the Celtic youth team who also worked for Celtic Boys Club. In court, he admitted 12 charges related to child sex abuse against 10 teenage boys between 1972 and 1996. He was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. He was already serving a jail term for abuse. Last year he washe was found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy in Belfast. In relation to the latest charges, most of his victims played for youth teams he ran in North Lanarkshire. The abuser who preyed on dreams of football stardom Four played for Celtic Boys Club and Celtic youth team. They were aged between 14 and 17. The incidents took place in several locations across Scotland - including team showers, hotel rooms and minibuses. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that among the complainers were former professional footballers. Jim McCafferty was already serving a jail term after a trial in Northern Ireland Some of his victims developed alcohol and mental health problems as a consequence of the abuse he subjected them too. Judge Lord Beckett said McCafferty was ""physically intimidating"" and used his ""overpowering"" nature to achieve his ""depraved objectives"" of abusing young boys. He added: ""You took advantage of your position of trust as a football coach to groom and then sexually abuse boys who played for your teams. ""You were adept at identifying the circumstances of different boys so that you could manipulate them and in some cases their parents in a variety of ways. ""All of this was done to facilitate your sexually abusing children."" He added: ""Careers did not reach their full potential, some were cut short and lives have been seriously blighted. Many of those that you abused have suffered from enduring anxiety and depression caused by what you did. ""Conduct of this kind has a wider effect which is corrupting and socially corrosive. It has the potential to undermine the trust which people place in youth football and sports clubs."" McCafferty's lawyer told the court he wanted to apologise to his victims and their families. He is the fourth man connected to either Celtic or Celtic Boys Club to be found guilty of historical child sex abuse in the past year. Both Jim Torbett (left) and Frank Cairney (right) have been convicted of abusing children at Celtic Boys Club Last NovemberCeltic Boys Club founder Jim Tobett was jailedfor six years for sexually abusing three boys over eight years. Earlier this year, the boys club's former chairman,Gerald King, was given a three-year probation orderfor sexually abusing four boys and a girl in the 1980s. And in FebruaryFrank Cairney, a former manager of the boys club, was jailed for four yearsafter being convicted of nine charges of sexually abusing young footballers. Outside court, Det Ch Insp Sarah Taylor said McCafferty exploited his position to satisfy his own ""sexual depravity"". She paid tribute to the victims who ""lived in fear as boys"", but found the courage and strength to speak out as adults. ""They were listened to and without their testimony we would not be here today witnessing McCafferty's long awaited admissions of guilt,"" she said. ""The scale of his abuse is unprecedented, and demonstrates the systematic and calculated methods he used to target his victims. ""Whether as a respected coach or an affable kit man, he used every opportunity available to perpetrate his callous abuse."" Patrick McGuire, of Thompsons Solicitors, is representing some of McCafferty's victims in civil cases. He called for action from Celtic Football Club. ""McCafferty's connection with Celtic is now utterly undeniable,"" he said. ""We now know that some of the abuse took place in Celtic premises. What he did was groom the boys but at the same time groom the parents, always with Celtic dangling on the end of a stick as a golden carrot. It's just utterly unforgivable. ""McCafferty's conviction is probably the last conviction that we'll see in a Celtic setting. But what's never happened is any form of financial justice for the survivors of abuse at Celtic Park and that's why now all eyes are on the board of Celtic Football Club to do the right thing.""

"Inequality driving 'deaths of despair'Inequalities are damaging health and trust in democracy, the IFS think tank says.Family & Education","Widening inequalities in pay, health and opportunities in the UK are undermining trust in democracy, says an Institute for Fiscal Studies report. The think tank warns of runaway incomes for high earners but rises in ""deaths of despair"", such as from addiction and suicide, among the poorest. It warns of risks to ""centre-ground"" politics from stagnating pay and divides in health and education. The report says such widening gaps are ""making a mockery of democracy"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country's leading research institutes, is launching what it says is the UK's biggest analysis of inequality. That will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Prof Sir Angus Deaton. He said ""people were troubled by inequality"" more than at any time since the 1940s - and the impact was so serious that it suggested ""democratic capitalism is broken"". He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work - and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by ""taking rather than making"". Sir Angus said ""people getting rich is a good thing"" but not if it meant ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"". Report author Sir Angus Deaton: Nobel laureate expert on poverty Middle classes losing out to ultra rich Half of children born into families renting British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' A third of millennials face renting their entire lives At the outset of this review, the IFS has published indicators of inequality - such as the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now earning 145 times the average salary, up from 47 times in 1998. It suggests pay inequality in the UK is high by international standards - with the share of household income going to the richest 1% having tripled in the past three decades. The middle classes are also under pressure, particularly younger generations, with stagnant pay and unaffordable house prices. The long-term decline in trade union membership is identified as another factor in wages not increasing. As well as inequality in income, the think tank highlights divergence in health. It says there is almost a 10-year gap in male life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas - and the IFS warns of ""deaths of despair"", with a rise in early deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and suicide being linked to factors such as poverty, social isolation and mental health problems. Patterns of relationship are also affected by inequality, the study suggests. Over recent decades, wealthier people have become more likely to be living in a couple, either married or co-habiting, the IFS says. But among the poor, declining numbers are living with a partner, a pattern attributed to increasing job insecurity, a lack of financial independence and more ""chaotic lives"". The big picture, says the IFS, is the UK is becoming more like the US, with a concentration of wealth at the top and pressure on working families lower down the pay scale. This video can not be played 'Inequality of political voice is even worse', says Prof Sir Angus Deaton It says that in the US, increases in life expectancy have stalled and that for non-graduate male workers, pay has not risen in real terms for five decades. ""The risk is that the UK may follow a similar path,"" says the IFS study. The IFS warns of the social tensions that will come with an economic landscape built on widening inequality. As economic think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported recently, this is likely to putpressure on the middle classesas well as those on low incomes. James Hutchinson says if people do not feel they are making progress, they become ""disconnected"" University science researcher James Hutchinson, in his 30s, feels he has kept his side of the bargain - gaining a degree from Cambridge - and now working as an academic as well as raising a family with his partner. But he feels a sense of ""powerlessness"" about the cost of housing and that his work has no job security, with a series of short-term contracts. ""It's not a sob story,"" says Dr Hutchinson, ""But if people feel they can't improve their lot, then they feel disconnected."" ""We were sold the idea that academic success is the way to be better off,"" he says. His partner Bethany has decided not to work because she can't afford childcare. She says ""for me as a parent, I didn't feel comfortable with us being separated... and then working all hours."" Bethany and her partner James Hutchinson have struggled to make ends meet for their family They live in Bristol and struggled to get somewhere they could afford to live - currently the family all sleep in one room while they patch up their home. Dr Hutchinson recognises that he's ""more privileged than many"" - earning the average for UK graduates of Â£35,000 per year - but he voices a frustration at a lack of progress and fears that things could get even worse for his children. The ""disconnect"" comes, he says, from his generation becoming ""increasingly aware of your own expendability"" and a work culture haunted by a ""constant lack of security"". Dr Hutchinson is sceptical that any of the political rhetoric will translate into real improvements. ""How do we build a functional society out of dysfunctional lives?"" he asks.

Normal diet 'would give me brain damage',"This video can not be played Mark Edwards has lived with PKU since he was born A man with a rare inability to digest protein has said eating a normal diet would leave him brain damaged. Mark Edwards, 35, has phenylketonuria,external(PKU), meaning he can only eat 6g (0.2oz) of protein per day - about one egg or two tablespoons of beans. Eating more than his body could process could cause him to suffer depression, anxiety or even brain damage. A form of treatment, Kuvan, is not available on the NHS - which instead recommends a strict diet. A number of MPs arecalling on drug company BioMarin to make the ""life-changing"" treatment affordableto UK patients. BioMarin said the NHS had not accepted its ""very competitive"" offer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises the NHS, said it had not begun its appraisal of Kuvan to treat PKU, but has made the ""exceptional decision"" to ask a panel to look at the issue. After this, a formal referral will be required from the UK government's health minister to determine the process under which Kuvan will be assessed, a spokeswoman said. The woman who is allergic to water 'I was made allergic to my husband's sperm' Mr Edwards, from Llanegryn in Gwynedd, was diagnosed with PKU at birth after it showed up in the standard blood tests given to babies - the condition affects one in 10,000 people in the UK. He spends about Â£4,000 a year on Kuvan tablets, which allow him to eat more protein - and said they could change the lives of people with PKU. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins. But people with PKU cannot properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine, and the levels build up in the bloodstream and the brain - leading to a number of health problems. Containers showing how much protein Mark can eat in a day ""I can't have any meat, no egg, so nothing. Just what is available on prescription, really,"" said Mr Edwards With Kuvan, Mr Edwards is able to eat up to 15g (0.5oz) a day, which he called ""a massive difference"". ""It's been available for 10 years but BioMarin, the company which makes it, they've put a price on it which is too expensive for the NHS,"" he said. Mr Edwards has met Westminster politicians to discuss how sufferers of conditions such as PKU have been ""massively failed by the system"". He is being supported by Plaid Cymru's Westminster spokeswoman, Liz Saville-Roberts, who said any drug with the potential to improve the lives of those with PKU should be easily and freely available. The company which makes Kuvan says the only countries not funding it in Europe are the UK and Poland Kuvan reduces the levels of phenylalanine in many with PKU. BioMarin said it had put the drug forward for commissioning five times in the past 10 years with no success. ""The burden and severity of PKU as a disease in the UK is not recognised by NICE or the NHS,"" it said. ""BioMarin has made an offer to the NHS which is very competitive compared to other markets but it has not been accepted.""

Organised crime fight 'needs an extra ÃÂ£3bn',"Teenager George Duke-Cohan was jailed for sending thousands of hoax bomb threats to schools The UK ""can't afford not to"" spend an extra Â£3bn on fighting organised crime over the next three years, the head of the National Crime Agency has warned. Lynne Owens said the threat from criminal gangs is ""staggering"" and that the public will ""feel the consequences"" if the extra funds are not found. She said the investment should include more than doubling the NCA's annual budget from Â£424m to nearly Â£1.1bn. The government says it invests in the right tools for law enforcement. The agency's annual review of organised crime says there are more than 4,500 groups with 37,000 members in the UK. Speaking in central London, Ms Owens argued that the threat from drug dealers, cyber criminals, human trafficking gangs and sexual predators was growing ""in scale and complexity"". Ms Owens told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the NCA faces a ""chronic and corrosive threat"". She said: ""It's a number of things, it's globalisation, it's the rapid use and expansion of technology, it's the development of encryption and it's the demand for services - it's the supply of drugs, and we are a nation unfortunately, with a high demand for drugs. ""It's paedophiles using the dark web to target children in their bedrooms, those who dominate communities using fear and violence through the trade of drugs and firearms and illicit finance and cyber crime."" NCA director general Lynne Owens says more investment is needed to fight organised crime The student who made a fortune blackmailing porn website users Modern day slavery cases up by a third County lines drugs gangs exploiting children as young as 11 When asked about reports indicating that the number of organised crime groups has fallen over the past year, Ms Owens said ""that's quite an old-fashioned way of looking at things. ""For example offenders operating on the dark web might only network through technology. So they won't be part of a traditional organisation, but they are a network of like-minded individuals and that is why we get to a higher figure of offenders."" At present the NCA spends Â£424m a year and has approximately 4,500 staff. By contrast, it estimates that 181,000 offenders can be ultimately linked to serious and organised crime - from drug dealing through to people trafficking, cyber extortion and the trade in online sexual abuse imagery. Ms Owens calculates that British investigators now need an extra Â£2.7bn over three years - to include an extra Â£650m annually for her agency. She says that extra cash would be less than the weekly estimated cost of organised crime to the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Enhancing our capabilities is critical to our national security. If we don't, the whole of UK law enforcement, and therefore the public, will feel the consequences. Some will say we cannot afford to provide more investment, but I say we cannot afford not to."" Responding to the NCA's call for more cash, security minister Ben Wallace acknowledged the scale of the threat - but did not immediately promise any more spending. ""Our serious organised crime strategy, published in November 2018, set out how we will mobilise the full force of the state to target and disrupt serious and organised crime. ""As criminals' use of technology evolves so must our response. We continue to invest in the right capabilities and tools in law enforcement, across government and in partnership with the private sector."" If the NCA could arrest all the gang members it knows about, they'd fill enough double-decker buses to jam every major road between the agency's headquarters and the Home Office, where its budget is set (trust me - I'll spare you the maths). The call for more cash isn't just an operational matter - it is a big political challenge after many other warnings from police leaders about cuts. If ministers found this huge pile of extra cash down the Whitehall sofa, it would go on not only investigators but resources for digital forensic and specialist surveillance operations. The challenge would still be enormous - here's just one example of how quickly organised criminals shift their focus: The UK's introduction of a forgery-proofed polymer Â£10 note has been followed by a surge in counterfeit Â£20s and Â£50s. As fast as investigators catch up, the criminal has found a new way to make a profit. The NCA's sixth annual review of organised crime says groups have been fragmenting and capitalising on new technology not only to hide their identities but to increase their profits. The rise of virtual or crypto currencies - which can be exceptionally difficult to track - is helping offenders launder their profits more efficiently without leaving a trail for investigators to pick up. On cyber-crime specifically, the UK is fighting sustained attempts by Russian-speaking gangs to make money by targeting British computers - either through ransom attacks that lock up systems or through the theft of personal banking credentials. One of the biggest threats has been the rise in sites in hidden parts of the internet where images of sexual abuse of children are traded. The NCA estimates that 144,000 of the people involved in these dark web sites are based in the UK - 5% of all known users. And it warns that Brexit will not only affect the ability of the NCA to work efficiently with its partners in the EU but could also lead to an increase in bribery and corruption as British companies enter into new markets around the world.

PM's negotiator to explore Brexit changesOlly Robbins heads to Brussels as cabinet ministers discuss the future of talks with Labour.UK PoliticsComments,"Chief negotiator Olly Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the political declaration Theresa May's Brexit negotiator has gone to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU. Olly Robbins is looking to see whether a key demand being made by Labour in cross-party talks can be satisfied. But as cabinet discussed the state of the talks, Theresa May faced calls from senior Conservative MPs not to agree a compromise with Jeremy Corbyn. Ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the process was a ""blind alley"". The Labour leader is also facing demands from his MPs to abandon the talks, which have been going on for more than a month with little apparent progress. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Cross-party deal must include new referendum - Sir Keir Starmer What's in the political declaration? Labour negotiators want any deal they strike with minister to be reflected in changes to the political declaration made with Brussels. This 27-page document was published alongside Mrs May's withdrawal agreement and sets out the parameters for the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but is not legally binding. In Brussels, Mr Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the declaration if the government and Labour can come to an agreement. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said officials were currently on a ""Brexit break"", but would come out of it ""if there is something happening in London"". ""We will listen to Olly Robbins tomorrow,"" she added. Meanwhile, in Westminster, the cabinet has been taking stock of progress so far in the talks, while Labour's shadow cabinet will meet later to discuss the state of play. Cabinet are discussing the state of the Brexit talks Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, and 13 former cabinet ministers have written to Mrs May to warn her not to agree a compromise with Labour that includes a customs union with the EU. Insidea customs unionthere would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between the UK and other EU nations - something that is seen as advantageous for business. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, and for some, that fails to satisfy the desire for a clean break with Brussels after Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? Among the former cabinet ministers are Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and sacked defence secretary Gavin Williamson, as well as Maria Miller and Sir Michael Fallon, who supported Remain in the 2016 referendum. According to the Times,external, the letter said such a compromise would lose the support of Conservatives who previously backed the prime minister's deal, and would be unlikely to gain enough Labour votes to pass. It said: ""More fundamentally, you would have lost the loyal middle of the Conservative Party, split our party and with likely nothing positive to show for it. No leader can [bind] his or her successor, so the deal would likely be at best temporary, at worst illusory."" Sir Michael said the government's focus should be on addressing Conservative and Democratic Unionist Party concerns over the Northern Irish border and finding alternative arrangements tothe backstop,not doing a deal with Labour. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""The talks are clearly not going anywhere. ""If they are going to include permanent membership of a customs union then frankly we would be better off staying in the EU then we would have a voice in the trade arrangements that are being negotiated. ""We can't say we are leaving the EU then half stay in it."" Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. ""Both sides agree that no Parliament can bind a future government and most EU trade deals have a six to 12-month exit clause.""

"Former youth football coach admits abuseJim McCafferty, who worked at Celtic, Hibs and Falkirk, is jailed after admitting a series of child sex abuse crimes.Glasgow & West Scotland","Jim McCafferty leaves court after his sentencing A former youth coach involved in Scottish football has been given a further jail sentence after admitting a series of child sex abuse crimes. Jim McCafferty, 73, was a coach and kit man for the Celtic youth team who also worked for Celtic Boys Club. In court, he admitted 12 charges related to child sex abuse against 10 teenage boys between 1972 and 1996. He was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. He was already serving a jail term for abuse. Last year he washe was found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy in Belfast. In relation to the latest charges, most of his victims played for youth teams he ran in North Lanarkshire. The abuser who preyed on dreams of football stardom Four played for Celtic Boys Club and Celtic youth team. They were aged between 14 and 17. The incidents took place in several locations across Scotland - including team showers, hotel rooms and minibuses. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that among the complainers were former professional footballers. Jim McCafferty was already serving a jail term after a trial in Northern Ireland Some of his victims developed alcohol and mental health problems as a consequence of the abuse he subjected them too. Judge Lord Beckett said McCafferty was ""physically intimidating"" and used his ""overpowering"" nature to achieve his ""depraved objectives"" of abusing young boys. He added: ""You took advantage of your position of trust as a football coach to groom and then sexually abuse boys who played for your teams. ""You were adept at identifying the circumstances of different boys so that you could manipulate them and in some cases their parents in a variety of ways. ""All of this was done to facilitate your sexually abusing children."" He added: ""Careers did not reach their full potential, some were cut short and lives have been seriously blighted. Many of those that you abused have suffered from enduring anxiety and depression caused by what you did. ""Conduct of this kind has a wider effect which is corrupting and socially corrosive. It has the potential to undermine the trust which people place in youth football and sports clubs."" McCafferty's lawyer told the court he wanted to apologise to his victims and their families. He is the fourth man connected to either Celtic or Celtic Boys Club to be found guilty of historical child sex abuse in the past year. Both Jim Torbett (left) and Frank Cairney (right) have been convicted of abusing children at Celtic Boys Club Last NovemberCeltic Boys Club founder Jim Tobett was jailedfor six years for sexually abusing three boys over eight years. Earlier this year, the boys club's former chairman,Gerald King, was given a three-year probation orderfor sexually abusing four boys and a girl in the 1980s. And in FebruaryFrank Cairney, a former manager of the boys club, was jailed for four yearsafter being convicted of nine charges of sexually abusing young footballers. Outside court, Det Ch Insp Sarah Taylor said McCafferty exploited his position to satisfy his own ""sexual depravity"". She paid tribute to the victims who ""lived in fear as boys"", but found the courage and strength to speak out as adults. ""They were listened to and without their testimony we would not be here today witnessing McCafferty's long awaited admissions of guilt,"" she said. ""The scale of his abuse is unprecedented, and demonstrates the systematic and calculated methods he used to target his victims. ""Whether as a respected coach or an affable kit man, he used every opportunity available to perpetrate his callous abuse."" Patrick McGuire, of Thompsons Solicitors, is representing some of McCafferty's victims in civil cases. He called for action from Celtic Football Club. ""McCafferty's connection with Celtic is now utterly undeniable,"" he said. ""We now know that some of the abuse took place in Celtic premises. What he did was groom the boys but at the same time groom the parents, always with Celtic dangling on the end of a stick as a golden carrot. It's just utterly unforgivable. ""McCafferty's conviction is probably the last conviction that we'll see in a Celtic setting. But what's never happened is any form of financial justice for the survivors of abuse at Celtic Park and that's why now all eyes are on the board of Celtic Football Club to do the right thing.""

'Bring your own lunchbox to cut waste',"You might only be grabbing a sandwich, crisps and maybe a cake and coffee, but that unremarkable weekday lunch can produce four or more items of waste. That adds up: the UK's lunch-on-the-go habit is creating nearly 11 billion pieces of packaging every year, says environmental campaign group Hubbub. Their solution? More packed lunches. But if you do buy lunch, take your own container to the shop and ask them to fill it, the charity suggests. Hubbub surveyed 1,200 UK office workers and more than half of them said they were buying takeaway lunches more than they used to five years ago, generating an estimated 276 items of waste per person per year. ""People are saying that they are buying food to take out because life has got busier,"" says Hubbub's Tessa Tricks. ""It's that sense that, 'I'm important and having this on the go will make me do things more efficiently,' but sometimes sitting with crockery and cutlery and enjoying it would be better."" Ms Tricks argues it is usually both healthier and cheaper to make a packed lunch, but the charity is also encouraging people to pop a plastic box in their bag alongside their reusable coffee cup, if they plan to buy takeaway food. Food outlets âshould list all ingredientsâ 'Eco-friendly' bags survive three years in soil Food waste 'worse for climate than plastic' Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Hubbub says a trial in East Anglia showed that offering a 10% price reduction did persuade some customers to come prepared with their own lunch box. Lyn McAlister who runs Cafe 7 in Norwich says the idea went down well with her customers and that she's continuing to offer the discount even now the trial's over. ""I think we need to keep spreading the word and hopefully other companies will come aboard too,"" she says. Some takeaways use recyclable packaging Larger takeaway food chains say customers bringing in containers could present a health and safety risk. But they say they are making other moves to reduce waste. Some, like Pret a Manger, offer water so customers can avoid buying it in bottles. Pret has also started moving its napkins and cutlery behind the counter, after a trial showed it reduced plastic cutlery usage by 30%. The Japanese-inspired takeaway chain Itsu says it is experimenting with putting recycling bins in front of its restaurants, although it says it is proving difficult to ensure waste streams are kept uncontaminated. Anything soiled with food can't be sent for recycling. ""We are trialling moving to bowls for all eat-in orders,"" says Itsu's spokeswoman. ""These obviously will be washed and reused."" Leon which markets itself as offering healthy fast-food says it would ""love"" to incentivise customers to bring in reusable containers, but there would have to be ""strict controls to minimise the risk of cross-contamination"". It points out that it already serves its food in cardboard boxes which can be composted or recycled (a removable greaseproof paper lining prevents the box being soiled) and biodegradable cutlery. However, Hubbub's Ms Tricks points out schemes like this fall down if customers don't dispose of the packaging correctly.

UK jobless rate falls to lowest since mid-70s,"Britain's female unemployment rate in the first three months of the year has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalincluded the figure in data showing the overall unemployment rate in the three-month period stood at 3.8%, the lowest rate since late 1974. For men the rate was 3.9%, the lowest since mid 1975. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees rose by 3.3%. The ONS said that unemployment rates for both men and women have been falling since late 2013. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the unemployment figures were strong given the issues facing the economy. ""The UK labour market has been remarkably resilient in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty,"" he said. For January to March 2019, the ONS said 1.3 million people were unemployed, 119,000 fewer than for a year earlier and 914,000 fewer than for five years earlier. The overall unemployment rate of 3.8% in the first quarter was last matched in the three-month period from November 1974 to January 1975. It was last lower, at 3.7%, in October to December 1974. Over the last five years the unemployment rate for men has fallen from 7% to 3.9% and for women has shown a smaller fall over this period - from 6.4% to 3.7%. But this is the lowest level since 1971, when records began. The ONS said the increase in the employment rate for women is due partly to changes to the state pension age for women, so fewer women are retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The ONS added that total hours worked by women had increased while for men had stayed stable. This is because falls in the employment rate for men have been roughly offset by population increases. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the increased participation rate of women was part of ""a cultural change seen across developed economies"". It may also reflect higher wages attracting women and older workers into the workplace, he added. While average real wages - adjusted for inflation - were the highest since December 2010, the TUC said the rate of growth was slowing. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Pay growth is stalling again. The last thing workers need is another hit in the pocket when real wages are still lower than a decade ago"". Employment Minister Alok Sharma said the rise in wages and booming higher-skilled employment meant prospects for families were improving. ""We now need to shift some of our focus to up-skilling people and supporting them into roles with real career progression to create a modern workforce fit for the challenges of the 21st Century,"" he said. Not since Barry White's 'My first My last My everything' and 'Wombling Merry Christmas' were in the charts has the unemployment rate been lower (December 1974). And the rate of unemployment among women is now the lowest it's been since 1971 - try Janis Joplin's Mercedes Benz (Oh Lord). In both of those years, the official policy goal was to obtain full employment. And although inflation was higher in the 1970s, who wouldn't welcome the lowest unemployment since then? Well, to be a party-pooper, it's not like most of those women are going to be able to afford a Merc themselves. Wages have risen by 3.3%, 1.5% above inflation. But that's still only modest wage growth compared to the 1970s (when prices rose quickly, but wages mostly rose faster).  We're not getting better off as fast as we did back then. And back then, productivity - the amount each worker could produce - was on the rise. Now, according to the latest figures, it's dropped. Output per worker barely grew compared to a year before - up just 0.7%. That's not enough to fund the bigger pay rises. And at the same time, it's getting harder and harder to find the staff to meet orders. You may be able to afford what you want, but you may have to wait a little longer. Prof Geraint Johnes, at Lancaster University Management School, said the number of full-time employees fell in the quarter, which was offset by an increase in full-time self-employed workers and that the number of employees working part time also rose. ""Whether these shifts indicate a longer term increase in precarity will need to be monitored carefully over the coming months. The labour market seems now to be exhibiting signs of nervousness that, given present uncertainties, should not be surprising,"" Prof Johnes said. Mr Wishart noted that employment only rose by 99,000 during the period, driven by self-employment, while full-time employment fell by 55,000. ""Despite the unemployment rate edging down to a fresh 45-year low, March's figures painted a picture of a softening labour market,"" Mr Wishart said.

"Tearful Felicity Huffman admits fraudProsecutors recommend prison time for the actress, who paid to have her daughter's exam corrected.US & Canada","This video can not be played Felicity Huffman was silent as she left court US actress Felicity Huffman has pleaded guilty to fraudulently conspiring to win a college place for her daughter. In a Boston court, the Desperate Housewives star admitted paying $15,000 (Â£11,500) to have her daughter's exam answers secretly corrected in 2017. In a statement last month, she said she was in ""full acceptance"" of her guilt. Prosecutors recommended a four-month prison term and a $20,000 fine. Huffman, 56, was among 50 charged in the college admissions scandal. The wealthy parents charged in the investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents. They managed to fraudulently secure spots for the teenagers at elite US universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford. Parents and college athletics coaches were charged in the scheme, but none of the children were indicted. Huffman did not speak to reporters outside court as she arrived to Monday's hearing holding hands with her brother. How much difference does going to a top US university make? She admitted one count of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The Emmy-winning actress cried while speaking to the judge, according to reporters in the courtroom. Her plea deal recommendation of four months in prison was at the lower end of sentencing guidelines, which could have carried a custodial term of up to 20 years. According to court documents, she was secretly recorded by the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, after he began co-operating with investigators. Singer helped Huffman falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy. When Sophia's school initially wanted to invigilate as she sat her test, Huffman expressed concern to Singer. The actress emailed to him, ""Ruh Ro!"" - the catchphrase of cartoon dog Scooby-Doo when he was in trouble. Actress Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty to her role in the scam Singer arranged so that Sophia could complete the SAT, which is the US college entrance test, elsewhere. Sophia scored an SAT score of 1420 out of a possible 1600 on the doctored test, about 400 points higher than a preliminary SAT she had taken a year earlier. The actress made arrangements to cheat a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so, according to prosecutors. Her husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges. Huffman said her daughter was unaware of the cheating, and that she felt ""regret and shame"" for having ""betrayed"" her. She will be sentenced on 13 September. Last month, Netflix announced it would postpone the release of a movie, Otherhood, starring Huffman that was originally set for release on 26 April. It did not specify a new premiere date. Though Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, the $15,000 she parted with was among the smallest sums allegedly paid by any of the other parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents. Lori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.

"MP calls for Jeremy Kyle show to goCharles Walker says the death of a guest on the show is ""a watershed moment"".Entertainment & Arts","Steven Dymond took part in a recording for The Jeremy Kyle Show MPs have called for The Jeremy Kyle Show to be axed after the death of a man who appeared on the programme. Steven Dymond, 63, was found dead on 9 May following a recording of the ITV show during which he took a lie detector test. Hampshire Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious. Downing Street called the death ""deeply concerning"", and a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the show was ""the theatre of cruelty"". ITV has already suspended both filming and broadcasting of The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the episode in question will not be screened. The broadcaster said everyone at the show was ""shocked and saddened"" and ""thoughts are with the family and friends"". An inquest into Mr Dymond's death is likely to be opened within the next few days, a spokeswoman for Portsmouth coroner's office said, and they are awaiting the result of the post-mortem investigation. Commenting on the case, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Broadcasters and production companies have a responsibility for the mental health and wellbeing of participants and viewers of their programmes. ""We are clear they must have appropriate levels of support in place."" 'I worked on The Jeremy Kyle Show' This video can not be played Jeremy Kyle Show: Audience member recalls Steven Dymond episode The pre-recorded episode Mr Dymond took part in was based on the subject of infidelity and it is understood he took a lie detector test. A member of the audience who was at the recording, Babette, 20, told the BBC: ""As soon as the test result was announced [Dymond] was already crying but he was shocked. ""His fiancee was heartbroken and sobbing. Steve couldn't believe it had come back as a fail. ""He was put into a position where his story was meant to be entertaining. I'm just shocked by it all."" About one million people watch The Jeremy Kyle Show every day Speaking to The Sun,external, Mr Dymond's former fiancee Jane Callaghan said: ""I know we split up a week ago but we were together for two years. I still loved him. ""We got engaged Christmas Day 2017. He was crying, the love was real. He was the most generous and loving person. ""He was quietly struggling, and we didn't know at the time. He cheated on me, I know he did. I can't forgive but I just want him to be alive."" The basic question prompted by Steve Dymond's death is whether the very genre of which Jeremy Kyle is the personification has any place on our screens. Nobody doubts it is a commercial success. In a highly competitive market, the show has delivered solid ratings for years; and the fact that it has been on air for 14 years is testament to ITV's support for it. But is it right to allow private trauma to become public spectacle? And is the ultimate result nothing less than the exploitation - for commercial gain at ITV, and for voyeuristic viewers - of highly vulnerable people? Read more from Amolhere. Conservative MP Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, has called on Ofcom to carry out an independent review into the duty of care policies in place at The Jeremy Kyle Show and others. He told the BBC that the committee would discuss the issue at a private meeting on Wednesday. Charles Walker MP, who has spoken openly about his own mental health issues, has urged ITV to axe The Jeremy Kyle Show for good. He told the BBC it would be ""extremely sensible"" if ITV said ""this has gone far enough"", adding that it was ""a watershed moment"". Charles Walker says the TV we watch ""is a reflection of ourselves"". Mr Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne and a member of the all-party parliamentary group on suicide and self-harm prevention, told the BBC that guests on The Jeremy Kyle Show were ""not really guests, they're victims"". ""I don't want to pile in on Jeremy Kyle because he probably feels bad enough, although obviously not as bad as the familyâ¦ and this is a shared responsibility,"" Mr Walker said. ""None of this stuff would be made if nobody watched it."" Mr Walker,who has openly talked about having OCD, added: ""Jeremy Kyle is a talented man who can do other things and go on to make other TV shows. The Jeremy Kyle Show will become just a memory. ""Societally, we have a responsibility for why this TV is made, it's a reflection of ourselves that it has been made and so many people watch it. ""It's cruel and there's enough cruelty in the world without showing it on TV."" Labour MP for Sunderland Central, Julie Elliott, agreed the programme should be culled, saying she has had ""grave concerns"" for some time about the way shows like The Jeremy Kyle Show ""appear to exploit the most vulnerable in society"". And psychiatrist Sir Simon Wessely, who was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists until 2017, said: ""I think it should be dropped, actually. It's the theatre of cruelty. ""And yes, it might entertain a million people a day, but then again, so did Christians versus Lions."" The Jeremy Kyle Show is the most popular programme on ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. This video can not be played Former ITV chairman Michael Grade: 'ITV is right to take the show off air' All previous episodes of the show have been taken down from the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will not air on ITV2 either. In an email to staff, ITV boss Dame Carolyn McCall said the decision to take the show off air was ""not in any way a reflection on the show, but the best way we think we can protect the show and the production team from the reaction we expect to this death"". White Dee, as she became known after finding fame on documentary series Benefits Street, defended the show, following an appearance in February. ""I received an awful lot of pre-show care along with a good bit of after-show care,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding it was ""a very positive experience"". White Dee took part in a Jeremy Kyle special on the price of fame ITV said in a statement: ""The Jeremy Kyle Show has significant and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors pre, during and post-show which have been built up over 14 years, and there have been numerous positive outcomes from this, including parties who have resolved complex and long-standing personal problems."" ITV's former executive chairman Michael Grade told the BBC he thought ITV has ""handled it immaculately"". ""I don't think it hurts ITV, they've got a hole in the schedule, they've got some very creative people, they'll come up with some new format, some new idea, it's an opportunity. But they're absolutely right to have taken the programme off the air."" Media watchdog Ofcom said on Monday that it was a ""very distressing case"" and it was in discussion with ITV to understand what took place - but it can only assess content that has been broadcast. The Jeremy Kyle Show has been broadcast in its mid-morning slot since 2005. Its guests discuss relationship issues and conflicts with each other in front of Kyle's studio audience. It is well-known for its often heated debates, with Kyle mediating between guests. This video can not be played Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James: TV producers are well-meaning but are not mental health care experts. Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James, who has worked on various reality TV shows over the last 15 years, told BBC Breakfast that care of TV guests had improved in general but added there was still work to be done. ""One of the difficulties comes from the fact that even though producers want to help, they don't always understand how psychological services work,"" she said.

"'Bring your own lunchbox to cut waste'The UK's lunch-on-the-go habit is creating nearly 11bn items of waste a year, say campaigners.","You might only be grabbing a sandwich, crisps and maybe a cake and coffee, but that unremarkable weekday lunch can produce four or more items of waste. That adds up: the UK's lunch-on-the-go habit is creating nearly 11 billion pieces of packaging every year, says environmental campaign group Hubbub. Their solution? More packed lunches. But if you do buy lunch, take your own container to the shop and ask them to fill it, the charity suggests. Hubbub surveyed 1,200 UK office workers and more than half of them said they were buying takeaway lunches more than they used to five years ago, generating an estimated 276 items of waste per person per year. ""People are saying that they are buying food to take out because life has got busier,"" says Hubbub's Tessa Tricks. ""It's that sense that, 'I'm important and having this on the go will make me do things more efficiently,' but sometimes sitting with crockery and cutlery and enjoying it would be better."" Ms Tricks argues it is usually both healthier and cheaper to make a packed lunch, but the charity is also encouraging people to pop a plastic box in their bag alongside their reusable coffee cup, if they plan to buy takeaway food. Food outlets âshould list all ingredientsâ 'Eco-friendly' bags survive three years in soil Food waste 'worse for climate than plastic' Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Hubbub says a trial in East Anglia showed that offering a 10% price reduction did persuade some customers to come prepared with their own lunch box. Lyn McAlister who runs Cafe 7 in Norwich says the idea went down well with her customers and that she's continuing to offer the discount even now the trial's over. ""I think we need to keep spreading the word and hopefully other companies will come aboard too,"" she says. Some takeaways use recyclable packaging Larger takeaway food chains say customers bringing in containers could present a health and safety risk. But they say they are making other moves to reduce waste. Some, like Pret a Manger, offer water so customers can avoid buying it in bottles. Pret has also started moving its napkins and cutlery behind the counter, after a trial showed it reduced plastic cutlery usage by 30%. The Japanese-inspired takeaway chain Itsu says it is experimenting with putting recycling bins in front of its restaurants, although it says it is proving difficult to ensure waste streams are kept uncontaminated. Anything soiled with food can't be sent for recycling. ""We are trialling moving to bowls for all eat-in orders,"" says Itsu's spokeswoman. ""These obviously will be washed and reused."" Leon which markets itself as offering healthy fast-food says it would ""love"" to incentivise customers to bring in reusable containers, but there would have to be ""strict controls to minimise the risk of cross-contamination"". It points out that it already serves its food in cardboard boxes which can be composted or recycled (a removable greaseproof paper lining prevents the box being soiled) and biodegradable cutlery. However, Hubbub's Ms Tricks points out schemes like this fall down if customers don't dispose of the packaging correctly. Lunch-on-the-go ""is a recycling minefield"" she says, because by its nature it is often being taken away from the point of purchase. And out on the street or back in the office there isn't often the infrastructure to support recycling and composting.

About one million people watch The Jeremy Kyle Show every day Speaking to The Sun,external, Mr Dymond's former fiancee Jane Callaghan said: ""I know we split up a week ago but we were together for two years. I still loved him. ""We got engaged Christmas Day 2017. He was crying, the love was real. He was the most generous and loving person. ""He was quietly struggling, and we didn't know at the time. He cheated on me, I know he did. I can't forgive but I just want him to be alive."" The basic question prompted by Steve Dymond's death is whether the very genre of which Jeremy Kyle is the personification has any place on our screens. Nobody doubts it is a commercial success. In a highly competitive market, the show has delivered solid ratings for years; and the fact that it has been on air for 14 years is testament to ITV's support for it. But is it right to allow private trauma to become public spectacle? And is the ultimate result nothing less than the exploitation - for commercial gain at ITV, and for voyeuristic viewers - of highly vulnerable people? Read more from Amolhere. Conservative MP Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, has called on Ofcom to carry out an independent review into the duty of care policies in place at The Jeremy Kyle Show and others. He told the BBC that the committee would discuss the issue at a private meeting on Wednesday. Charles Walker MP, who has spoken openly about his own mental health issues, has urged ITV to axe The Jeremy Kyle Show for good. He told the BBC it would be ""extremely sensible"" if ITV said ""this has gone far enough"", adding that it was ""a watershed moment"". Charles Walker says the TV we watch ""is a reflection of ourselves"". Mr Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne and a member of the all-party parliamentary group on suicide and self-harm prevention, told the BBC that guests on The Jeremy Kyle Show were ""not really guests, they're victims"". ""I don't want to pile in on Jeremy Kyle because he probably feels bad enough, although obviously not as bad as the familyâ¦ and this is a shared responsibility,"" Mr Walker said. ""None of this stuff would be made if nobody watched it."" Mr Walker,who has openly talked about having OCD, added: ""Jeremy Kyle is a talented man who can do other things and go on to make other TV shows. The Jeremy Kyle Show will become just a memory. ""Societally, we have a responsibility for why this TV is made, it's a reflection of ourselves that it has been made and so many people watch it. ""It's cruel and there's enough cruelty in the world without showing it on TV."" Labour MP for Sunderland Central, Julie Elliott, agreed the programme should be culled, saying she has had ""grave concerns"" for some time about the way shows like The Jeremy Kyle Show ""appear to exploit the most vulnerable in society"". And psychiatrist Sir Simon Wessely, who was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists until 2017, said: ""I think it should be dropped, actually. It's the theatre of cruelty. ""And yes, it might entertain a million people a day, but then again, so did Christians versus Lions."" The Jeremy Kyle Show is the most popular programme on ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. This video can not be played Former ITV chairman Michael Grade: 'ITV is right to take the show off air' All previous episodes of the show have been taken down from the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will not air on ITV2 either. In an email to staff, ITV boss Dame Carolyn McCall said the decision to take the show off air was ""not in any way a reflection on the show, but the best way we think we can protect the show and the production team from the reaction we expect to this death"". White Dee, as she became known after finding fame on documentary series Benefits Street, defended the show, following an appearance in February. ""I received an awful lot of pre-show care along with a good bit of after-show care,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding it was ""a very positive experience"". White Dee took part in a Jeremy Kyle special on the price of fame ITV said in a statement: ""The Jeremy Kyle Show has significant and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors pre, during and post-show which have been built up over 14 years, and there have been numerous positive outcomes from this, including parties who have resolved complex and long-standing personal problems."" ITV's former executive chairman Michael Grade told the BBC he thought ITV has ""handled it immaculately"". ""I don't think it hurts ITV, they've got a hole in the schedule, they've got some very creative people, they'll come up with some new format, some new idea, it's an opportunity. But they're absolutely right to have taken the programme off the air."" Media watchdog Ofcom said on Monday that it was a ""very distressing case"" and it was in discussion with ITV to understand what took place - but it can only assess content that has been broadcast. The Jeremy Kyle Show has been broadcast in its mid-morning slot since 2005. Its guests discuss relationship issues and conflicts with each other in front of Kyle's studio audience. It is well-known for its often heated debates, with Kyle mediating between guests. This video can not be played Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James: TV producers are well-meaning but are not mental health care experts. Psychologist Honey Langcaster-James, who has worked on various reality TV shows over the last 15 years, told BBC Breakfast that care of TV guests had improved in general but added there was still work to be done. ""One of the difficulties comes from the fact that even though producers want to help, they don't always understand how psychological services work,"" she said.

PM's negotiator to explore Brexit changesOlly Robbins is heading to Brussels to discuss the declaration on the UK's future relations with the EU.UK Politics,"Chief negotiator Olly Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the political declaration Theresa May's Brexit negotiator has gone to Brussels to explore the scope for changes to the agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU. Olly Robbins is looking to see whether a key demand being made by Labour in cross-party talks can be satisfied. But as cabinet discussed the state of the talks, Theresa May faced calls from senior Conservative MPs not to agree a compromise with Jeremy Corbyn. Ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the process was a ""blind alley"". The Labour leader is also facing demands from his MPs to abandon the talks, which have been going on for more than a month with little apparent progress. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. The inability to agree on a way forward led the UK to miss its 29 March deadline for leaving the EU - the current date for departure is 31 October. Kuenssberg: Policy and politics Cross-party deal must include new referendum - Sir Keir Starmer What's in the political declaration? Labour negotiators want any deal they strike with minister to be reflected in changes to the political declaration made with Brussels. This 27-page document was published alongside Mrs May's withdrawal agreement and sets out the parameters for the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but is not legally binding. In Brussels, Mr Robbins will explore how quickly changes could be made to the declaration if the government and Labour can come to an agreement. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said officials were currently on a ""Brexit break"", but would come out of it ""if there is something happening in London"". ""We will listen to Olly Robbins tomorrow,"" she added. Meanwhile, in Westminster, the cabinet has been taking stock of progress so far in the talks, while Labour's shadow cabinet will meet later to discuss the state of play. Cabinet are discussing the state of the Brexit talks Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, and 13 former cabinet ministers have written to Mrs May to warn her not to agree a compromise with Labour that includes a customs union with the EU. Insidea customs unionthere would be no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between the UK and other EU nations - something that is seen as advantageous for business. But it would mean the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries around the world, and for some, that fails to satisfy the desire for a clean break with Brussels after Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? Among the former cabinet ministers are Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and sacked defence secretary Gavin Williamson, as well as Maria Miller and Sir Michael Fallon, who supported Remain in the 2016 referendum. According to the Times,external, the letter said such a compromise would lose the support of Conservatives who previously backed the prime minister's deal, and would be unlikely to gain enough Labour votes to pass. It said: ""More fundamentally, you would have lost the loyal middle of the Conservative Party, split our party and with likely nothing positive to show for it. No leader can [bind] his or her successor, so the deal would likely be at best temporary, at worst illusory."" Sir Michael said the government's focus should be on addressing Conservative and Democratic Unionist Party concerns over the Northern Irish border and finding alternative arrangements tothe backstop,not doing a deal with Labour. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""The talks are clearly not going anywhere. ""If they are going to include permanent membership of a customs union then frankly we would be better off staying in the EU then we would have a voice in the trade arrangements that are being negotiated. ""We can't say we are leaving the EU then half stay in it."" Brexit: All you need to know What happens next? A Downing Street source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a compromise was being sought with Labour on customs ""as an interim position or a stepping stone"". ""We will not sign up to a permanent customs union,"" the source said. ""Both sides agree that no Parliament can bind a future government and most EU trade deals have a six to 12-month exit clause.""

'Huge' variation in mental health spending,"There is nearly a two-fold difference in mental health spending across England, an analysis suggests. Mental health charity Mind looked at investment across 42 NHS regions. It found that Surrey Heartlands spent the least - Â£124 per person last year - compared with South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw, which spent more than Â£220. The charity said the differences were huge and would affect the quality of care but, despite the variation, spending was still rising everywhere. The findings have been released to coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week. Mental health spending has been made a priority in recent years. In 2016, extra funding was announced and this was added to last year when the government announced its 10-year plan for the NHS. The analysis by Mind showed all areas were increasing their mental health budgets in line with the overall increase in spending - part of a requirement set by the senior leadership in the NHS. But that masked the big variations that still existed, according to the projected spending levels in 2018-19. South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Â£220.63 Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly Â£207.97 North Central London Â£205.11 Surrey Heartlands Â£124.48 Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin Â£134.77 Gloucestershire Â£137.00 Certainly some of the differences will be linked to the variation in overall health budgets. More deprived areas with greater level of illness get more money. So that means while there is close to a two-fold difference in spending in cash terms, the proportion of the regional budget going on mental health is closer. For example, Surrey Heartlands set aside 10% of its budget to mental health, compared with more than 16% in South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw. One in four young women has mental illness Child mental health referrals 'up 26%' In charts: Report into children's mental health Geoff Heyes, of Mind, said while there was some ""positive change"" with budgets increasing, the ""long-term historic postcode lottery"" was still a concern. ""The treatment you get shouldn't depend on where you live. ""The NHS and government have made it clear that mental health is a priority. Some local variation is to be expected but the scale of the difference is huge and we know that the need outstrips resource even in the areas that are performing well."" He said as the extra money started to become available - between now and 2023 mental health is in line to get Â£2.3bn of the extra Â£20bn going on the NHS - local areas needed to address funding levels. A spokeswoman for NHS England said spending has, and would, continue to increase. She said in the next five years an extra 700,000 people would get care and support. ""Funding for mental health services will grow faster than the overall NHS budget,"" she added.

Sri Lanka vows 'maximum force' against rioters,"This mosque in Kiniyama was one of the places attacked Sri Lanka has partially lifted an overnight curfew imposed nationwide after the worst bout of anti-Muslim violence since the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Mosques and Muslim-owned shops were vandalised or set on fire, and one Muslim man was slashed to death. A curfew will remain in the North-Western province until further notice, police said. In several towns, police fired into the air and used tear gas to disperse mobs. Tensions have been high since Islamist militants attacked churches and hotels three weeks ago on Easter Sunday, killing more than 250 people. In a televised address, Police Chief Chandana Wickramaratne warned that officers would respond to rioters with maximum force. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also appealed for calm, saying the current unrest was hampering the investigation into last month's attacks. The family networks behind the bombings Children of the Easter Sunday carnage Sri Lanka country profile Muslims make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people, who are predominantly Sinhalese Buddhists. Mob violence in central Sri Lanka targeting Muslim communities in March of last year prompted the government to declare a state of emergency. The unrest centred on districts north of the capital, Colombo: In the north-western town of Kiniyama, hundreds of people stormed a mosque, destroying windows and doors and burning Korans, according to witnesses. The attack was triggered by a group of people demanding a search of the building after soldiers inspected a lake nearby looking for weapons, Reuters news agency reports The motorbikes of worshippers were also damaged In the Catholic-majority town of Chilaw, Muslim-owned shops and mosques were attacked after a dispute that started on Facebook, police said. A 38-year-old Muslim businessman identified as the author of the post that sparked the violence was arrested A man died from stab wounds after a mob attacked his business in Puttalam District, also in Sri Lanka's north-west. ""Mobs had attacked him with sharp weapons at his carpentry workshop,"" a police official told AFP news agency. ""This is the first death from the riots"" Incidents were reported in the town of Hettipola, where at least three shops were reportedly torched. A large pasta factory was burned near Minuwangoda, with the owners accusing police of standing by while employees were trapped inside. The police have said that 13 people were arrested in Minuwangoda, where Muslim-owned shops were also attacked Shops were attacked in Minuwangoda The violence has prompted concern from the UN. The global body's special advisers on genocide prevention and the responsibility to protect called on the government to make clear it would ""not tolerate the spread of prejudice and hate among groups within its population"". ""Sri Lanka has a pluralistic society. To be a Sri Lankan is to be a Buddhist, to be Hindu, to be a Muslim, to be a Christian,"" they said. The government says that security forces have restored calm to streets in the areas affected by violence and insist officers are preventing revenge attacks on Muslims. ""What we want to say is that the government is very determined to control this and from tonight onwards it shall be completely controlled,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, an adviser to the president, told the BBC. Leaders from across the political spectrum have been pleading for calm and urging people not to share rumours via social media. Officials have blocked some social media platforms and messaging apps, including Facebook and Whatsapp, in an attempt to curb outbreaks of unrest. ""I appeal to all citizens to remain calm and not be swayed by false information.,externalSecurity forces are working tirelessly to apprehend terrorists and ensure the security of the country,"" the prime minister tweeted. Nevertheless, there is concern among some Muslims that their fears about retaliatory violence were not acted on soon enough.  One Muslim businessman, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he feared for his safety. ""We can see many places where the curfew has been announced. The army is on the streets with guns, but they don't take any action against the violence,"" he said. Sri Lanka has a history of ethnic conflict and the latest violence has triggered alarm. Separatists rebels from the Tamil minority community fought a violent insurgency against government forces for decades until the civil war ended in 2009. On Sunday 21 April six near-simultaneous suicide bombs exploded at hotels and churches across the country. Hours later, two more bombs were detonated, with fewer casualties, as police closed in on those behind the bombings. More than 250 people were killed in the wave of the attacks which stunned the world and the country - Sri Lanka was weeks away from marking 10 years of relative peace since the end of its brutal civil war. Police have blamed two local Islamist groups for the Easter Sunday bombings and dozens of arrests have been made in the weeks since. The Islamic State group has said it was involved but has given no details.

'Growing inequality threatens democracy',"Widening inequalities in pay, health and opportunities in the UK are undermining trust in democracy, says an Institute for Fiscal Studies report. The think tank warns of runaway incomes for high earners but rises in ""deaths of despair"", such as from addiction and suicide, among the poorest. It warns of risks to ""centre-ground"" politics from stagnating pay and divides in health and education. The report says such widening gaps are ""making a mockery of democracy"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country's leading research institutes, is launching what it says is the UK's biggest analysis of inequality. That will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Prof Sir Angus Deaton. He said ""people were troubled by inequality"" more than at any time since the 1940s - and the impact was so serious that it suggested ""democratic capitalism is broken"". He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work - and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by ""taking rather than making"". Sir Angus said ""people getting rich is a good thing"" but not if it meant ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"". Report author Sir Angus Deaton: Nobel laureate expert on poverty Middle classes losing out to ultra rich Half of children born into families renting British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' A third of millennials face renting their entire lives At the outset of this review, the IFS has published indicators of inequality - such as the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now earning 145 times the average salary, up from 47 times in 1998. It suggests pay inequality in the UK is high by international standards - with the share of household income going to the richest 1% having tripled in the past three decades. The middle classes are also under pressure, particularly younger generations, with stagnant pay and unaffordable house prices. The long-term decline in trade union membership is identified as another factor in wages not increasing. As well as inequality in income, the think tank highlights divergence in health. It says there is almost a 10-year gap in male life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas - and the IFS warns of ""deaths of despair"", with a rise in early deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and suicide being linked to factors such as poverty, social isolation and mental health problems. Patterns of relationship are also affected by inequality, the study suggests. Over recent decades, wealthier people have become more likely to be living in a couple, either married or co-habiting, the IFS says. But among the poor, declining numbers are living with a partner, a pattern attributed to increasing job insecurity, a lack of financial independence and more ""chaotic lives"". The big picture, says the IFS, is the UK is becoming more like the US, with a concentration of wealth at the top and pressure on working families lower down the pay scale. This video can not be played 'Inequality of political voice is even worse', says Prof Sir Angus Deaton It says that in the US, increases in life expectancy have stalled and that for non-graduate male workers, pay has not risen in real terms for five decades. ""The risk is that the UK may follow a similar path,"" says the IFS study. The IFS warns of the social tensions that will come with an economic landscape built on widening inequality. As economic think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported recently, this is likely to putpressure on the middle classesas well as those on low incomes. James Hutchinson says if people do not feel they are making progress, they become ""disconnected"" University science researcher James Hutchinson, in his 30s, feels he has kept his side of the bargain - gaining a degree from Cambridge - and now working as an academic as well as raising a family with his partner. But he feels a sense of ""powerlessness"" about the cost of housing and that his work has no job security, with a series of short-term contracts. ""It's not a sob story,"" says Dr Hutchinson, ""But if people feel they can't improve their lot, then they feel disconnected."" ""We were sold the idea that academic success is the way to be better off,"" he says. His partner Bethany has decided not to work because she can't afford childcare. She says ""for me as a parent, I didn't feel comfortable with us being separated... and then working all hours."" Bethany and her partner James Hutchinson have struggled to make ends meet for their family They live in Bristol and struggled to get somewhere they could afford to live - currently the family all sleep in one room while they patch up their home. Dr Hutchinson recognises that he's ""more privileged than many"" - earning the average for UK graduates of Â£35,000 per year - but he voices a frustration at a lack of progress and fears that things could get even worse for his children. The ""disconnect"" comes, he says, from his generation becoming ""increasingly aware of your own expendability"" and a work culture haunted by a ""constant lack of security"". Dr Hutchinson is sceptical that any of the political rhetoric will translate into real improvements. ""How do we build a functional society out of dysfunctional lives?"" he asks.

WhatsApp 'weaponised' in Brazil election,"Political campaigners in Brazil have used software that scrapes Facebook for citizens' phone numbers, and then automatically sends them WhatsApp messages and adds them to WhatsApp groups. Almost three weeks ago, 147 million voters in the country went to the polls for legislative elections and the first round of the presidential elections. This Sunday, they will decide between far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro and the left-wing Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad, in the second round of the presidential election. A BBC investigation has discovered that efforts to support various parties and candidates - covering state, federal and senate votes - have used the bulk message technique. WhatsApp is not just used as a private messaging app in Brazil. Many mobile phone networks allow unlimited WhatsApp access to subscribers, so even people who cannot afford an internet plan can use it. As a result, the platform has taken on some of the roles filled by social networks in other countries. Many people join interest-based WhatsApp groups to talk about politics and hobbies with people they have not met. WhatsApp claims 120 million Brazilians currently use its service. It is commonly used to share news - and misinformation. Some of the devices involved in the data scraping can send up to 300,000 messages at a time. They are sold via the internet and some sellers claim their use is hard to trace. The method is not limited to politics. Marketeers have also used it to promote cosmetics and foods, among other products, to Brazilians. BBC News Brasil interviewed people linked to different campaigns, on condition of anonymity. They included activists and marketeers, who reported how they used the scraping and bulk-messaging tools. In addition, the team spoke to companies selling the software as well as to people who had recently been added to politically linked WhatsApp groups without their consent. The scheme violates WhatsApp-owner Facebook's rules. In the view of some experts, it could also constitute an electoral crime. For its part, Facebook says it has banned hundreds of thousands of suspicious WhatsApp accounts and closed several Facebook pages and accounts linked to a marketing group believed to be supportive of Bolsonaro. The scraping software allows its clients to choose a target audience by searching for keywords, pages or public groups on Facebook. In fewer than 10 minutes and 10 clicks, it is possible to gather almost 1,000 phone numbers. Data can be group by city, gender and interests. Contacts can also be gathered by: using details voluntarily provided by a candidate's supporters buying databases sold legally in Brazil using information stolen or bought illegally from telephone service providers One woman in the Sao Paulo neighbourhood of Grajau remembers discovering that she had been added to four WhatsApp groups. ""I don't know where they found my phone number,"" the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""The administrators and some people had foreign numbers. I got scared, I left all of the groups and reported all of them to WhatsApp."" She added that after a day or two, she was added to a further eight groups. She said she had not provided her number to any political campaign, but had made it public on Facebook. Fighting Brazil's election on WhatsApp The secret world of Brazil's WhatsApp abortions Brazil general elections 2018 A 23-year-old university student living in Campinas reported having been added to three groups, in which four individuals dominated the conversation. ""They sent dozens of memes and videos against PT (the Workers' Party) every day,"" said the young man who also asked not to be named. ""Other people were sending lots of content too, and it was crazy."" Bulk WhatsAppmessaging Luiz Rodrigues Junior, of Agency Genius Publicidade, is one marketeer who acknowledged having tested adding people to WhatsApp groups in order to distribute political messages in bulk. But he said he had only used databases that had been legally compiled, and had opted not to pursue the strategy because it was not efficient. He declined to reveal which candidates he had acted on behalf of. ""I can't create a group that [explicitly] supports my candidate because that may expose him, people may attack him in the group and I'll have no control over it,"" he explained. ""So we set up election groups, with names like 'End corruption in the election', invited a lot of people through the software and put them in the group. ""Half of those who were added left and half stayed. ""Within this group, we placed two or three of our own professionals, who began to post content supporting our case and started debates. ""Then we would replicate this in many other groups, maybe 50 or 100."" In some cases, groups could be limited to residents of a neighbourhood who were facing a specific problem for which his candidate offered a solution, he said. But he explained that to make the strategy work he would have required an army of employees to keep discussions on track. How dobulk messagingprograms work? The mass delivery of WhatsApp messages generally involves the use of ""click farms"". But some services do not require special equipment any more, just Sim card details to be entered into a computer running relevant software. Several strategies are employed to avoid detection. One trick is to list the telephone numbers being used in ads posted to classified sites. When members of the public try to contact them, they ""legitimise"" the numbers and fool WhatsApp's bot detectors. Because the market is relatively new, the price, structure, and complexity of the tools vary greatly. In the interior of Sao Paulo state, for example, it is possible to find services that sell a package of one million WhatsApp messages for the equivalent of Â£6,200. WhatsApplimits In WhatsApp, each user can be a member of as many groups as he or she wants, but there are some limits. One is that each member can only create up to 9,999 groups. Another is the number of messages forwarded simultaneously to different conversations. This was reduced from 256 to 20 in August as part of efforts to tackle fake news. Some researchers are now calling for the number to be further reduced. They point to India, where the limit has been cut to five. But WhatsApp has said there would not be enough time to make the change before the weekend's vote. ""We have advanced spam detection technology that identifies accounts with abnormal behaviour so they cannot be used to spread spam or misinformation,"" said a statement from WhatsApp. ""We are also taking immediate legal action to prevent companies from sending bulk messages via WhatsApp and have already banned accounts associated with these companies."" Brazil's Electoral Court said that ""there is no specific electoral legislation for WhatsApp"" or similar apps, but added that the law does cover electoral advertising via the internet. But part of the problem with applying this to WhatsApp is its use of end-to-end encryption, explained one expert at the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). ""The content is not on the platform's servers, but on users' devices,"" said Prof Carlos Affonso Souza. And because WhatsApp cannot unscramble the encrypted messages itself to read them, it is unable to vet the content in the same way other social media platforms can, he added. ""I'm afraid that this debate will make us return to discussions of blocking the application or forcing it to give up its cryptography.""
