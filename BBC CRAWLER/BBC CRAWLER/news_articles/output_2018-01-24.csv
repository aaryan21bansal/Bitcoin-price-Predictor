Finsbury Park accused 'blew kiss at crowd',"A man accused of driving a van into people near a London mosque blew a kiss and smiled as he was put in a police vehicle after the alleged attack, a court has heard. A witness told the jury he would never forget the driver's ""constant smiling"". Darren Osborne, 48, is accused of ploughing into worshippers in Finsbury Park in June last year, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies murder and attempted murder. The court has already heard that the area was busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers at the time, and witnesses - including those who helped to apprehend the man - have been describing how events unfolded. In a statement, one bystander, Susan Can, told Woolwich Crown Court he was detained by police and put in the back of their van in front of a ""very angry"" crowd. ""As he was sat in there, I saw him blow a kiss at the crowd. This made them angrier still,"" she said. Another witness, Adnan Mohamud, said he recalled the driver lying on the floor with a smile on his face, saying: ""I have done my job, you can kill me now."" ""Something I will never forget was that he was constantly smiling,"" Mr Mohamud added. ""I knew at this point that what he did was not an accident - it was definitely deliberate."" Jurors earlier heard how a crowd had gathered around Makram Ali after he collapsed at the roadside before the alleged attack. Mr Mohamud called 999 for an ambulance, and in a recording played to the jury, he is heard speaking to the operator before a loud noise and shouts of distress. The operator can be heard saying ""hello"" 24 times before a male voice comes back on the line to say ""someone's just come with a big van and run over a load of people."" Ibrahim Benaounda had been tending to Mr Ali when he was struck, the jury heard. ""It felt like being on a rollercoaster, and spinning round and round. I could feel everything. I could feel my bones breaking,"" he told the court in his statement. Another witness, Hamdi Alfaiq, 38, who walked into the courtroom on crutches, had been offering Mr Ali a sip of water before he was hit and woke from consciousness under the van, the court heard. He told the jury: ""They pulled me out but I don't remember anything from when I was underneath."" Another witness, Mohamoud Geedi, 28, told the court he was knocked over by the van's wing mirror, but got up and launched himself at the driver. Mr Geedi said he had seen a white van speeding up and heard the noise of gears changing as it turned into Whadcoat Street, shortly after midnight on 19 June last year. ""I see the big white van, I can see the headlights. I can hear a rev,"" he said. ""I could see there was one driver that was in the vehicle. It was going towards us."" Another eyewitness, Mahad Mohamed Ismail, said in a statement it seemed as if the driver's foot was ""flat"" on the pedal as the vehicle moved towards the crowd. The attack happened during the month of Ramadan Describing the scene after the van struck the crowd, Mr Geedi said: ""I looked at a lot of people just splattered all over the place."" He told jurors the van only stopped when it hit some bollards, and the driver ran towards the crowd ""with his head down, punching, lots of people were trying to grab him"". He and others wrestled the driver to the ground, and tried to punch and kick him until a local imam intervened, saying: ""It's not worth it,"" Mr Geedi said. The imam, Mohammed Mahmoud, told the court the driver was facing punches ""from almost every direction"". He said he urged people not to touch the man after he had been stopped from fleeing the scene. Mr Mahmoud added: ""He posed no harm to anybody. He was immobilised. ""He wasn't a threat and therefore he should answer for his crime in a court such as this, which he is doing now, and not in a court in the streets."" The jury was also shown footage of the driver swearing and laughing after his arrest outside Islington police station. In the video from a police body-worn camera, the man is heard making comments about the Rotherham grooming scandal, Sadiq Khan, Grenfell Tower, the Iraq war.

Snake owner killed by his pet pythonAnimal lover Daniel Brandon died from asphyxiation and his python Tiny was found near his body.3h3 hours agoHampshire & Isle of Wight,"Daniel Brandon's social media pages showed him posing with snakes, including a python A snake owner was killed by an 8ft (2.4m) pet python he called his ""baby"", an inquest has heard. Daniel Brandon, 31, died from asphyxiation at his home near Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 25 August. One of the pets - a female African rock python named Tiny - was found near his body, out of its pen. Coroner Andrew Bradley said there was no doubt Mr Brandon died ""as a result of contact with Tiny"" and he recorded a verdict of misadventure. Mr Brandon had kept snakes for 16 years and Tiny was one of 10 snakes and 12 tarantulas he kept in his room at the family home, North Hampshire Coroner's Court heard. His mother Barbara Brandon said her son had owned Tiny since it was small enough to fit in his hand. He never felt threatened by Tiny and was aware of how strong it was, she said, but there were occasions when it would ""strike out"" if she entered the room. She told the court on the night of her son's death she heard a bang coming from his room, but had assumed it was a dumbbell falling or that he knocked something over. She later discovered Mr Brandon unconscious in his bedroom and later found the snake coiled under a cabinet. Scientific name is Python sebae Therock python is Africa's largest snake Can reach lengths of up to 7m and weights of 90kg Native to Sub-Saharan Africa They are non-venomous but have a devastating power to constrict their prey before swallowing it whole In the wild, they can prey on animals such as monkeys, warthogs, antelopes and even crocodiles Source: BBC Nature Pythons kill by wrapping themselves around their prey and squeezing tighter and tighter but they rarely kill humans. Mr Bradley said: ""The most likely scenario is that Tiny was engaged with Dan - I have no doubt about that. ""She was coiling around him, at which point I have no idea. There was a point at which either she takes hold of him unexpectedly or trips him up or some other mechanism."" Mr Bradley said the snake then hid, probably ""because of the shock of him falling or because of his reaction"". However, reptile expert Prof John Cooper, who examined Tiny at the Brandons' home in November, told the court Mr Brandon ""would have known how to unwrap a python"". Prof Cooper also inspected the skin that Tiny shed later that month and said if the snake had coiled around Mr Brandon, there would have been scratches visible on the snake's skin caused by him trying to get the reptile off - but there were none. A statement issued by Mrs Brandon after the conclusion of the inquest described her son as ""one of the funniest people you could wish to meet"". ""I cry every day and night and relive that evening all the time,"" she said. ""All the family wanted was answers to our questions, and I have no idea yet whether we have that or will."" Daniel Brandon had kept snakes for 16 years Mr Brandon's social media pages showed him posing with snakes, including a Burmese python. Friends set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in his memory. A friend posted: ""Dan was obsessed with snakes, spiders, birds and all wildlife. ""We have struggled when looking for photos for his funeral to find any when he isn't holding a spider, snake, small bird, toad, slow worm, hedgehog, feeding a fox, stroking cattle, befriending a cat or dog so these charities seemed the perfect choice.""

Meat supplier probed over food hygiene,"A meat wholesaler which supplies pub chain Wetherspoon, schools and care homes is being investigated over food hygiene concerns. TheFood Standards Agency (FSA) said,externalit had stopped any meat leaving Russell Hume company sites and unused meat had been withdrawn from its customers. Wetherspoon pubs had removed steak from the menu on their weekly steak night. Russell Hume said the recall was a ""precautionary measure because of mislabelling"". The company, which also supplies a range of hospitality and catering businesses, added: ""We have no reason to believe that the product was unsafe to eat."" In a statement on Wednesday the FSA said it had carried out an unannounced inspection of Russell Hume's Birmingham site on 12 January. It then ""became aware of instances of serious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations"", it said. As a result, investigations into food standards were carried out at all Russell Hume sites and other locations where its products were stored in England, Scotland and Wales, the agency said. ""Russell Hume were unable to demonstrate compliance with food hygiene rules at its locations, so we have stopped any product from leaving their sites until the business can provide assurances that they are complying with the relevant legislation, and that they are producing safe food,"" the FSA said. The FSA has also told Russell Hume to withdraw ""all affected product in the supply chain"". There was no indication that people had become ill from eating meat supplied by the company, according to the FSA. But it said it was ""concerned about the poor practices in place at their premises"" which was why it had taken ""proportionate action to ensure no meat can leave their sites at present"". Any unused Russell Hume meat has been ""withdrawn"" from its customers until the company ""can provide reassurances"". The FSA said its investigations were continuing. Russell Hume was co-operating with its investigation and was ""currently reviewing its procedures and retraining its staff"", it added.

Arena attack costs package announced,"The package includes more than Â£1m for the We Love Manchester Fund Manchester is to receive an extra Â£13m reimbursement from the government for most of the costs following the Arena terror attack, the prime minister said. The package includes more than Â£9m for policing and Â£2.6m for a mental health hub. In November, Manchester City Council said it wanted an extra Â£17m for the costs of dealing with the bombing. Twenty-two people were killed and 512 injured in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May. Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the new funding, which also includes more than Â£1m for the We Love Manchester Fund, brought the amount paid by the government to Â£24m. It added that the payout recognised ""the exceptional response required by the city as a result of this cowardly act"". Mrs May said: ""Following last year's terrible attack the strength and resilience of Manchester captured the nation - and nowhere was this more apparent than at the One Love Concert and city vigils where people joined together not only in grief, but to demonstrate to terrorists that they will never win."" Also included in the package is Â£250,000 to Marketing Manchester to continue promoting the city and the region. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, welcomed the funding but said ""it is disappointing"" that the government has ""not reimbursed the full costs incurred by the council as a result of this horrific event"". ""It is only right and proper that - as they promised at the time - the government should pick up these costs [incurred by Manchester's public services] rather than the people of Manchester having to do so,"" he said. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he is ""grateful"" the prime minister ""has taken a personal interest"" in ensuring ""a clear commitment to meet the majority of the costs"". However, he said ""there remain important outstanding issues"" that he and Sir Richard will seek to resolve with the government. The inquests into the victims' deaths, which opened and adjourned in June, heard 220 people required hospital treatment in the aftermath of the attack.

Elton John announces final world tour,"Sir Elton John has announced he will stop touring in order to prioritise his family. Speaking in New York, the star said he would say goodbye to fans with a series of 300 dates spanning three years.

That doesn't mean to say I'm not going to be creative. But I'm not going to travel."" The star denied reports in the press that he was retiring due to ill health. ""Last year I picked up an infection and I was very ill and it knocked me sideways,"" he admitted. But I still did 96 shows. ""Believe me - if you ever do 300 shows, you're not in ill health."" Sir Elton's Farewell Yellow Brick Road will kick off in the US this September, just months after he ends his six-month residency in Las Vegas. ""I don't want to go out with a whimper, but a big bang,"" he said, promising ""the most fantastic show I've ever done"". After his tour, he added that he might consider another residency - ""like Kate Bush,"" who played 22 dates at London's Hammersmith Apollo in 2014. The star's hits include Tiny Dancer, Candle in the Wind, Benny and the Jets and Your Song The star added he had come to the decision to spend more time at home with his husband, David Furnish. ""David and I sat down with a school schedule and I said, 'I don't want to miss too much of this.' ""I'm not stopping music. I'll hopefully be making more records. I'll be writing more musicals. But mostly, I'll be taking my kid to soccer academy - which is the most important thing. ""Life is all about change."" Sir Elton said he would be ""creative up til the day I die"" and that his farewell tour would be ""a wonderful way to thank people"". His two sons - who will be eight and 10 when the tour ends - will join him for parts of the tour, being taught by a tutor. ""I don't want to miss them and I don't want them to miss me,"" he said.

Last year, he wasforced to cancel nine showsin Las Vegas and California because of a bacterial infection he contracted during a South American tour. Sir Elton's management said the ""potentially deadly"" infection forced him to spend two nights in intensive care in April and to cancel concerts in the US. It was not the first time ill health had stopped the star from stepping on stage.

Rapist's victims 'told he would serve life',"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them Victims of rapist John Worboys were given written assurances about how long he would spend in jail after he was convicted, it has emerged. The CPS told victims the indeterminate term he received was ""to all intents and purposes"" a life sentence. Letters featuring the details, sent to his victims, have been seen by the BBC. Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers. News that the Parole Board haddecided to free Worboys after a decade behind barswas met with a furore by his victims and in Parliament. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Fresh Worboys sex attack claim investigated After Worboys' trial in 2009, the special casework lawyer for the CPS, Anthony Connell, wrote to victims to explain the sentencing process. He said: ""An indeterminate sentence is a new sentence that has been introduced only a few years ago. ""To all intents and purposes, it is a sentence of life imprisonment."" John Worboys was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 Mr Connell said it meant Worboys could apply for release after serving his minimum term. ""Merely because he is allowed to apply after eight years, does not mean that he will be granted parole,"" he wrote. ""It is clear from the judge's sentencing remarks that he is considered a dangerous offender. ""Those responsible for considering any application by him will no doubt have in mind this fact together with the fact that he committed an awful lot of serious offences."" Mr Connell, who retired in 2015, concluded his letter by saying he hoped the conviction and sentence had brought the victims ""some peace of mind"". Anthony Connell said Worboys had been given a life sentence ""to all intents and purposes"" Five days after Worboys' trial ended, Det Insp David Reid wrote to the victims and confirmed 85 women had come forward to police. He also set out a series of questions victims wanted answering, including: ""Is he [Worboys] likely to be charged with other offences now?"" Det Insp Reid replied: ""No. This is partly because of the lengthy sentence anticipated. Also, given the significant publicity that the case has attracted, it is unlikely that he would be able to obtain a further fair trial."" The Scotland Yard detective went on to say that Worboys was a ""unique offender"" who was ""dangerous"" and had ""exacerbated the distress by refusing to accept what he has done"". Det Insp David Reid said Worboys was unlikely to be charged with more offences At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. As well as being ordered to serve at least eight years, Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence, meaning he could be kept in prison as for as long as he was deemed to remain a danger to the public. Newspapers threaten Worboys legal action Fresh Worboys sex assault claim Ministers won't challenge Worboys release Rapist's jail move bid refused in 2015 'No plans' to review Worboys rape claims The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Michelle Sadio: Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside London church Bach manuscript among items worth more than Â£45 million donated to UK museums Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Police concerned for 'vulnerable' missing man with autism last seen in north London Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Antonio Conte still looks like distinctly underwhelmed by life at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal's post-Alexis existence is going pretty well. A bit of a pot to polish would sweeten things even more. Intrigue to come. Tweet #bbcfootball or text 81111 Dimos:So, if Wenger does a Mourinho-2017 ie win Carabao Cup and Europa League, is he a success or a failure? Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Chelsea coach Antonio Conte on Sky Sports:""My thoughts are there is disappointment for the final result. ""I think my
players must be pleased with their effort, we tried to reach the final, we conceded two goals and we were unlucky, two deflections. ""It is a pity because we had a good run
in this competition, it is a pity for me, the players and fans. ""We started very well, played a good first half
and in the second half I saw a lot of balance. ""When there is an injury to one of your best players it is not simple, especially when on the bench the only substitue is Ross Barkley. ""Barkley has a lot of space for improvement, he is
working with us only two weeks but for sure today I was forced to make this substitution,

From what I've just watched, if Hazard leaves us, we're in deep trouble because I believe he is  well and truly the only player we rely on to create chances. ARrahmanfreak:Winning cups are a different ball game altogether. Conte hasn't won any in his managerial career.

He has to quickly learn.
We love you Antonio Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger speaking to Sky Sports:""In the first half we gave Chelsea too much respect and distance. We were a bit scared to go for it and we suffered from that. ""We were not playing in the right position but we amended that in the second half and took control of the game. We knew we could perform better in the second half and that's what we did. In the first half we watched them play a bit but we were tighter after the break. ""We lost a great player in Alexis Sanchez but when a team doesn't know what's going on in the dressing room there is less clarity and focus on performances. We know we have to deal with it now. ""We have some time to prepare for the final but we are happy to take our fans to Wembley. We've been there a few times now and we're happy to be going again."" Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea It is like a return to the Gunners pre-Wenger glory days.   Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsene Wenger said yesterday that some teams - cough Liverpool, cough, cough Tottenham - get undue prominence and praise in the media despite their lack of trophies. âYou celebrate some teams who have not been in a final for 25 years and yet you kill us even though we have won the FA Cup three times in the last four years,"" he said. âItâs like that, we have to live with that.â The club's Twitter account got the memo. Text 81111 Mohamed Elneny was actually a great signing by Wenger, he's not worldclass a very solid player, he was quality today and probably worth Â£25m in today's market. Stewart Smith Yep, but Leicester's third-choice striker is a Â£25m player in today's market. Only bitcoin has been on a steeper upward curve than footballers' transfer fees. Text 81111 Why canât Conte adapt to a desperate situation? 2-1 down and we still have five defenders and two defensive midfielders on the pitch! Alex, Lincoln Just as you think Arsenalâs season is falling apart after losing at Forest and Bournemouth , they fluke a couple of results together to semi - rescue their season.
It was the same last year after losing 5-1 twice to Bayern. 2 lucky draws in the FA Cup against Sutton and Lincoln again semi-rescues their season and they end up winning it Brian Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere speaking to Sky Sports:""The team effort in the second half was key when we knew he had to dig deep. We might have got a formation wrong in the first 25 minutes and they have good players in the middle who could take advantage. ""At this level, we are creating a few more chances and it takes a bit of luck some time. We have to be up for it and ready to go. ""I wouldn't see it as surreal being back here and in the first team. I went away on loan last season, but wanted to come back and fight for my place in the team."" Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka speaking to Sky Sports:""We changed the system in the second half and we were the better team.I think it is only my second goal from inside the box for Arsenal."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) Concerns aplenty for Chelsea fans after that result... John7144:Chelsea rely so much on Hazard  that all these Madrid rumours have me worried. antzhumbleent:I can clearly see why Conte is desperately after another striker, Batshuayi is just useless at times. st2405:Why didnât Conte start Batshuayi? Why is he the only manager in England that canât get the better of Wenger? Surely the clock is ticking for him... #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) They'll be partying on the streets of north London tonight! Can we play Chelsea every week? Callum, an ageing Arsenal fan Canât wait for Mkhitaryan to come into this team! Onwards and upwards JD Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Jermaine JenasFormer Tottenham midfielder at Emirates Stadium I gave Chelsea a lot of praise in the first half but they didn't really open up Arsenal apart from their goal. After that they were a bit stale unless Eden Hazard was on the ball. I was disappointed with Barkley but we've got to give him time. He's going to have to work something out very quickly. He has to take responsibility. He needs to be more productive, score goals and make things happen and be the player that Chelsea have bought. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Allow Twitter content?

Snake owner killed by his pet python,"Daniel Brandon's social media pages showed him posing with snakes, including a python A snake owner was killed by an 8ft (2.4m) pet python he called his ""baby"", an inquest has heard. Daniel Brandon, 31, died from asphyxiation at his home near Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 25 August. One of the pets - a female African rock python named Tiny - was found near his body, out of its pen. Coroner Andrew Bradley said there was no doubt Mr Brandon died ""as a result of contact with Tiny"" and he recorded a verdict of misadventure. Mr Brandon had kept snakes for 16 years and Tiny was one of 10 snakes and 12 tarantulas he kept in his room at the family home, North Hampshire Coroner's Court heard. His mother Barbara Brandon said her son had owned Tiny since it was small enough to fit in his hand. He never felt threatened by Tiny and was aware of how strong it was, she said, but there were occasions when it would ""strike out"" if she entered the room. She told the court on the night of her son's death she heard a bang coming from his room, but had assumed it was a dumbbell falling or that he knocked something over. She later discovered Mr Brandon unconscious in his bedroom and later found the snake coiled under a cabinet. Scientific name is Python sebae Therock python is Africa's largest snake Can reach lengths of up to 7m and weights of 90kg Native to Sub-Saharan Africa They are non-venomous but have a devastating power to constrict their prey before swallowing it whole In the wild, they can prey on animals such as monkeys, warthogs, antelopes and even crocodiles Source: BBC Nature Pythons kill by wrapping themselves around their prey and squeezing tighter and tighter but they rarely kill humans. Mr Bradley said: ""The most likely scenario is that Tiny was engaged with Dan - I have no doubt about that. ""She was coiling around him, at which point I have no idea. There was a point at which either she takes hold of him unexpectedly or trips him up or some other mechanism."" Mr Bradley said the snake then hid, probably ""because of the shock of him falling or because of his reaction"". However, reptile expert Prof John Cooper, who examined Tiny at the Brandons' home in November, told the court Mr Brandon ""would have known how to unwrap a python"". Prof Cooper also inspected the skin that Tiny shed later that month and said if the snake had coiled around Mr Brandon, there would have been scratches visible on the snake's skin caused by him trying to get the reptile off - but there were none. A statement issued by Mrs Brandon after the conclusion of the inquest described her son as ""one of the funniest people you could wish to meet"". ""I cry every day and night and relive that evening all the time,"" she said. ""All the family wanted was answers to our questions, and I have no idea yet whether we have that or will."" Daniel Brandon had kept snakes for 16 years Mr Brandon's social media pages showed him posing with snakes, including a Burmese python. Friends set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in his memory. A friend posted: ""Dan was obsessed with snakes, spiders, birds and all wildlife. ""We have struggled when looking for photos for his funeral to find any when he isn't holding a spider, snake, small bird, toad, slow worm, hedgehog, feeding a fox, stroking cattle, befriending a cat or dog so these charities seemed the perfect choice.""

Arsenal signs crypto-currency deal,"Arsenal has become the first major football club to sign a deal to promote a crypto-currency. The club has reached an agreement with the gaming company CashBet, which is planning to launch its own currency CashBet Coin. It will see CashBet Coin advertised at Arsenal's Premier League home games. But one crypto-currency expert has questioned whether the club is wise to promote what can be a very risky investment. CashBet is a Californian online gaming business formed in 2012, which is now launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). It aims to raise $40m by getting investors to buy CashBet Coins which can then be used to bet on its various online games. Arsenal's chief commercial officer Vinai Venkatesham said: ""We are looking forward to working with CashBet Coin as they launch their new crypto-currency."" I've asked Arsenal whether it was wise to endorse a highly volatile business and whether it was encouraging fans to bet with CashBet Coins. ""Not at all. The partnership aims to promote CashBet Coin ahead of their Initial Coin Offer on 24 January,"" a spokesman for the club said. ""It does not exist to encourage fans to bet with CashBet Coin."" ICOs have become an extremely popular way for businesses to raise money following the surge in value of Bitcoin, the original crypto-currency. But they are unregulated and investors who buy the coins have no stake in the business and receive no dividends. They hope to profit from the rising value of the crypto-currency. The Financial Conduct Authority has warned that ICOs are ""high-risk, speculative investments"". David Gerard, whose book ""Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain"" warns about the risks of investing in crypto-currencies, says Arsenal fans who might be encouraged to see CashBet Coins as a new way of betting need to be cautious. ""Crypto-currencies are less regulated than regular betting shops and it's a lot harder to get actual pounds back out again,"" Mr Gerard said. While CashBet says it is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission and the Alderney  Gambling Control Commission, a spokesman admitted that did not apply to its new crypto-currency venture. He said that punters who bet with CashBet's currency would eventually be able to convert their winnings into cash on third party exchanges.

Trump's 'hatred of sharks' boosts charities,"Sharks are a key ocean predator - they keep prey populations in check and ecosystems healthy Donald Trump's alleged hatred of sharks has inspired people to financially support international shark charities. The US president's dislike for the marine animal was revealed last week in an In Touch Weekly interview with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He reportedly said that he would never give money to shark charities, adding: ""I hope all sharks die.""

Cameron: Brexit not as bad as we thought,"This video can not be played David Cameron: Brexit's turned out 'less badly than we first thought' Brexit has ""turned out less badly than we first thought"", David Cameron has said. The former prime minister was recorded at the World Economic Forum in Davos saying the Leave vote was ""a mistake not a disaster"". Mr Cameron called the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, campaigned to stay in and resigned after the Leave side won. His apparently unguarded comments were highlighted by Channel 5 News. ""As I keep saying, it's a mistake not a disaster,"" he was heard saying in a conversation with steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal. ""It's turned out less badly than we first thought. But it's still going to be difficult."" The Remain campaign during the referendum warned of an immediate economic impact on the UK of a vote to leave the European Union. All you need to know about Brexit Brexit transition not a deferral - Davis ...and here's how Cameron's successor fared at today's PMQs In a speech to Vauxhall car workers, in Ellesmere Port, four months before the referendum, he warned voters about the economic shock that he said would be caused by a vote for Brexit. ""Let's just remember what a shock really means. It means pressure on the pound sterling. It means jobs being lost. It means mortgage rates might rise. It means businesses closing. It means hardworking people losing their livelihoods."" He stepped up his warnings as the referendum date approached, warning on 6 June that Brexit would be like putting a ""bomb"" under the UK economy and telling MPs a week later that ""nobody wants to have an emergency Budget, nobody wants to have cuts in public services, nobody wants to have tax increases"", but the economic ""crisis"" that would follow a vote to leave could not be ignored. ""We can avoid all of this by voting Remain next week,"" he added. He described a vote to leave the EU as a ""self-destruct option"" for the UK, after a Treasury analysis warned it would tip the UK into a year-long recession, with up to 820,000 jobs lost within two years. At other times he sounded more optimistic about the prospect of leaving, saying, in May 2016, ""Britain is an amazing country. We can find our way whatever the British people choose."" A leading Brexit supporter, former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, welcomed Mr Cameron's comments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's chief political correspondent, Vicki Young, said Tory Brexit cheerleaders she had spoken to were ""thrilled"", telling her the former PM had come round to their ""way of thinking"". But she said one leading Remain campaigner in the party said it was ""far too early"" to tell what the long-term consequences of leaving the EU would be. Former Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who now heads pro-Brexit campaign group Change Britain, said the former PM's ""scaremongering"" about the economic damage of Brexit had proved to be ""baseless"". ""I hope that pro-EU MPs who continue to do Britain's economy down join Mr Cameron in admitting they're wrong, and focus their energies on getting the best Brexit deal for the UK,"" she said. Although the pound fell sharply after the vote, the UK economy has continued to grow, and unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low. Mortgage rates have stayed at generally the same low levels they have been since the financial crisis in 2008. The UK and the EU are currently negotiating the terms for the UK's exit and future relations, and the date for Brexit has been set for 29 March 2019.

Presidents Club: More women speak out,"This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage details her experience at the event An undercover report by the Financial Times,externalhas exposed the alleged sexual harassment of hostesses at a charity dinner organised by The Presidents Club. Since the story hit the headlines,a number of women who have previously worked at the event have come forward with their experiences. Speaking to the BBC, they said they felt uncomfortable and described witnessing inappropriate behaviour at the annual event held at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Here are two of their stories. We have changed their names to protect their identities. Jo was 20 when she worked at the dinner in 2015. ""I was a law student and wanted to make some extra money. ""I had been hosting for a few different agencies by that time, and those jobs were all boring and normal. ""We were given food and wine when we arrived and I remember thinking there is no such thing as a free lunch, which did put me on edge. ""Later in the evening the men got more drunk, more flirtatious and more 'handsy' - they were groping the girls. ""Another hostess told me one of the men had asked me to come to his table. I told her I'd rather stick pins in my eyes. ""Some of the girls looked shell-shocked at what was happening, and some were more comfortable and sitting on the men's lap. ""Later the event moved to a number of smaller bars in the hotel. I saw some girls go up in the lift with the men. ""When it was time to leave, I just couldn't wait to get out of there. ""From then on I associated the Dorchester with that night. I refused to work at the hotel ever again."" Louise, who worked at the dinner in the same year, was a full-time model. ""For the Presidents Club event the client requested photos before we were hired. ""We were told to wear black nail varnish, sexy black shoes and black underwear. You also had to be at least 5ft 6in (1.7m). ""Men were summoning girls to sit on their laps. There were some girls who were voluntarily going over and were happy to talk to the guests. It was very flirtatious. ""The after-party was downstairs but I didn't go to that. I suppose this is where everything happened. ""I was paid Â£170 plus Â£20 for travel. ""This felt like a completely different atmosphere to other hosting events that I have worked at. The lines of what is acceptable and right felt very blurred. ""I never worked for the agency again.""

Army recruit 'shackled' at barracks,"Pte Sean Benton was found with five gunshot wounds at Deepcut in 1995 A young Army recruit confided in his sister he had been ""shackled"" and forced to ""parade around"" a canteen months before he died at Deepcut barracks in Surrey, an inquest heard. Tracy Lewis was giving evidence at the start of an inquest into Pte Sean Benton's death. Ms Lewis said her brother had told her he felt humiliated and embarrassed. Pte Benton, of Hastings, was the first of four recruits to die at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. He had five bullet wounds to his chest. The inquest heard that in March 1995 - three months before he died - Pte Benton told his sister he had been ""jailed"" at the base for 10 days. It was understood to have been a punishment for breaking a window. Ms Lewis said her brother told her he had been ""in jail for 10 days"" and ""shackled"". She added: ""He used that word. He was made to parade around the canteen, which embarrassed him, and he felt really humiliated."" When asked if Pte Benton had told her he felt humiliated, Ms Lewis replied: ""Yes."" She said her brother had declined to eat and asked to go back to the cells. Ms Lewis said her brother also told her about another incident, revealing he had been pushed out of a window. Adding that he smoked and drank more alcohol after he joined the Army, she said: ""He was different. He appeared different."" The inquest heard Pte Benton had taken two overdoses of paracetamol - one when he was 16 and on another occasion in the Army. Pte Benton's twin, Tony Benton, and sister, Tracy Lewis, were granted a fresh inquest at the High Court This is the second inquest into Pte Benton's death after his family campaigned for a full investigation amid allegations he suffered prolonged physical and psychological bullying at Deepcut. An original inquest in 1995 recorded a suicide verdict. Coroner Judge Peter Rook QC told the court the scope of the 1995 inquest had been ""limited"" and by engaging Article Two of the Human Rights Act, he had enabled a ""broader"" inquiry. He said the inquest would look at factors including: who fired any shots when Pte Benton died, his state of mind, bullying and harassment at Deepcut and any systemic shortcomings that may have contributed to his death. Pte Benton's mother died in 2015, but some of her statements were read out. One questioned why her son's death was ""very quickly treated as suicide"" and said there was ""something not right"". She asked why, if the Army was concerned about her son's welfare, he was not more closely supervised. In one statement, she recalled him coming home ""withdrawn and tired"". That weekend, she said he told her he was not being bullied, but the barracks were ""doing his head in and he wanted to get away"". The inquest, which is taking place at Woking Coroner's Court without a jury, was adjourned until Thursday.

Disgraced US Olympics doctor jailed,"The paedophile tried to claim his accusers ""fabricated"" allegations for money and fame Ex-US Olympic gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years after testimony from nearly 160 of his victims. The judge dismissed Nassar's attempted apology as insincere, saying he would ""be in darkness the rest of his life"". Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault against girls and young women, including Olympians. The 54-year-old had already been sentenced to 60 years for possession of child pornography. This video can not be played Larry Nassar speaks as judge says 'I've signed your death warrant' Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar during the sentencing: ""As much as it was my honour and privilege to hear the sister survivors, it was my honour and privilege to sentence you. ""Because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again."" She told the paedophile: ""You have not owned yet what you did. I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir. ""I've just signed your death warrant"". The 156 women who confronted a predator The judge who let survivors speak This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Following seven days of emotional testimony from Nassar's victims, he was given an opportunity to address the court. ""What I am feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma, and emotional destruction that all of you are feeling,"" he told the packed courtroom. ""There are no words to describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred,"" he added. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Lansing, Michigan Throughout the seven-day hearing, the stories have been strikingly similar - the former USA Gymnastics team doctor would call the women in for treatment, but instead of taking away their pain, he stole their innocence. Some were so young they didn't realise until years later that they had been sexually abused. As Larry Nassar sat in his prison overalls, just metres away from them, survivor after survivor looked him in the eye and reminded him of what he'd done to them. And that's been the most extraordinary thing about this hearing. While the content of their testimony has been harrowing, it's also been inspiring.Â  For survivors of sexual abuse it's hard to relive the experience, let alone do so in front of your attacker. Follow@BBCRajiniV,external But Judge Aquilina revealed he had written a letter to her after his guilty plea claiming his accusers had ""fabricated"" allegations to gain money and fame. Court spectators gasped as the judge read a passage in which Nassar said he had been ""manipulated"" into admitting his guilt. ""I was a good doctor because my treatments worked, and those patients that are now speaking out are the same ones that praised and came back over and over,"" Nassar wrote. He added in the letter: ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" As the judge finished her sentence, witnesses in the packed courtroom stood and applauded her verdict. His sentencing follows a week of harrowing testimony from scores of women, including Olympic gold medal gymnasts Aly Raisman and Jordyn Weiber. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony Their teammates, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, also revealed they had been abused by Nassar. In 2015, USA Gymnastics - the sport's top governing body - quietly cut ties with Nassar over allegations about his professional care. An investigation in 2014 resulted in a three-month suspension from Michigan State University (MSU), where he coached. But he continued to see patients until he was publicly accused of abuse in a 2016 report by the Indianapolis Star newspaper. This video can not be played Sister survivors condemn master manipulator Later that year, he was arrested and charged by Michigan officials with sexual contact with a child. A year later, he was sentenced for child abuse images found on his computer. Rachael Denhollander, who was one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, pointed the finger at MSU in court on Wednesday. ""How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth?"" Ms Denhollander, now a lawyer, asked as she described the abuse that occurred when she was 15 years old. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""No one believed because they did not listen,"" she said, recounting the several times victims told MSU of their allegations. ""Victims were silenced, intimidated, told they were receiving medical treatment, and at times sent back to be further abused. ""This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture when a predator can behave unabated."" Ms Denhollander said trauma at the abuse she suffered had ""cast a horrific shadow"" over her medical care when she gave birth to three children, including two daughters. Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon resigned over the scandal As the court adjourned on Wednesday, the US Olympic Committee (USOC) announced it would hold an independent investigation into the sex abuse scandal. ""The USOC has decided to launch an investigation by an independent third party to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have gone undetected for so long,"" USOC chief executive Scott Blackmun wrote in an open letter. On Tuesday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) said it would investigate MSU's original handling of the gymnasts' abuse claims. Late on Wednesday MSU President Lou Anna Simon resigned. After Nassar's sentence was read, lawmakers in the Michigan House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on her to resign. ""We have lost confidence in the ability of President Lou Anna K Simon to lead a transparent investigation, to implement changes that will ensure it never happens again, to protect students, and to lead Michigan State University forward,"" the resolution said.

Welsh NHS systems back up after 'chaos',"This video can not be played Bangor GP Dr Catrin Elis Williams said the IT failure was frustrating and dangerous Doctors and hospital staff were unable to access patient details due to a widespread failure in computer systems affecting the Welsh NHS on Wednesday. Consultants and GPs said they could not get blood and X-Ray results because their internal portal was down. The Welsh Government has since confirmed that all systems are now back up and running. But it warned ""there may be a backlog affecting some areas"". The National Cyber Security Centre said the problems were caused by technical issues and were not the result of a cyber attack. The problems did not lead to any data security issues, according to the Welsh Government's department of health and social services Allow Twitter content?

The British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales, which represents doctors, said it understood at least half of GP services had been affected. One GP called the situation ""chaos"" and said: ""I can't do anything. I need this system for everything."" Earlier, a warning on doctors' computers read that ""multiple services are affected, especially national services"". Bangor family GP Dr Catrin Elis Williams described the situation as ""very frustrating and rather dangerous"". Her computer system went down about lunchtime on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately it's caused us quite a lot of problems with trying to get patients' results, past medical histories and letters from hospitals,"" she said. ""We have seen a few people we can't help because we can't get that information."" Doctors saw this message when they tried to access the Welsh NHS portal The fact the system went down also meant staff could not get phone numbers of patients to contact them and cancel appointments. Other problems included the fact notes from appointments could not be typed up and saved, meaning there will be a backlog. ""The system has gone down before but only for short periods,"" she added. Philip Young, 48, from Caerphilly went to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport on Wednesday to find out the results of a biopsy he had taken from a mass on his vocal chords two weeks before Christmas. But he was told the results were not available due to the systems being down and that he should return in a month. His ex-partner Emma Noble said it was ""very concerning"" and she was ""annoyed for him"". ""To have to wait another month is completely unacceptable, we could be talking about cancer here,"" she said. ""It's not just something you can leave."" Doctors saw this message on their computer screens when trying to access the Welsh NHS portal Ms Noble said she had called the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board complaints line, but it was inundated and she would have to call back in the morning. The assembly's opposition health spokesman Angela Burns said the problems were ""incredibly concerning, especially in the aftermath of last year's ransomware attack on the NHS."" ""The focus must now be on supporting these centres to manage this incident swiftly so that patient data is secure and that care is not adversely affected,"" said the Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. ""This is under investigation by the NHS Wales Informatics Service and is being dealt with as a priority,"" a Welsh Government spokesman added. Powys NHS IT department said: ""There is currently a major incident affecting a number of nationally hosted systems across NHS Wales. What is a computer server? ""The issue appears related to national firewalls and is being currently investigated.'"" Dr Alan Woodall, chairman of GP Survival UK who works from a surgery in Montgomeryshire, said: ""Myself and colleagues that work in primary care cannot access electronic patient records which is severely inhibiting our ability to provide patient care."" Another doctor, working from a GP Surgery in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area that covers Swansea and Bridgend, described it as ""chaos"", adding: ""I can't do anything. I need this system for everything."" A consultant at Morriston Hospital in Swansea told the BBC he could not access blood and X-Ray results on his computer because their internal intranet portal is not working. A senior registrar at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant said the problems started mid-morning on Wednesday.

Elton John to make statement on future,"Sir Elton John is set to make an announcement about his future career at a press conference on Wednesday. The star is expected to reveal plans for a new venture after his Las Vegas residency ends in May after six years. British newspaperThe Mirror has reported,externalthe 70-year-old will announce his final world tour. His representatives would not confirm the report before the press conference, which will take place simultaneously in New York and London. Sir Elton has sold more than 300 million records over his career and is one of the world's most in-demand live performers. Last year, he wasforced to cancel nine showsin Las Vegas and California because of a bacterial infection he contracted during a South American tour. Sir Elton's management said the ""potentially deadly"" infection forced him to spend two nights in intensive care in April and to cancel concerts in the US. However he played 87 shows throughout 2017, including dates in Europe and Australia, as well as his demanding Las Vegas show, The Million Dollar Piano. He also appeared as himself in action movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle last year. The star is due to perform a duet with Miley Cyrus at Sunday's Grammy Awards. He will also host a special concert in his honour at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, with guest stars including Sam Smith, Chris Martin, Kesha, John Legend and Keith Urban. He is currently working on a Broadway musical based on The Devil Wears Prada, as well as the live action version of Disney's The Lion King and the animation Sherlock Gnomes, produced by his own production company. Visitors to Sir Elton's official website are currently being met with a countdown to Wednesday's press conference, and the words ""I've finally decided my future lies..."" - a reference to lyrics from his hit Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The announcement was preceded by a stunt at London's Kings Cross Station, where fans could sit at a grand piano and play alongside an ""augmented reality"" Sir Elton. That, combined with the fact that Wednesday's press conference takes place at YouTube's headquarters, suggests there will be a tech aspect to the star's announcement. A teaser on Sir Elton's Twitter feed featured video of his career-making shows at the Los Angeles Troubadour in 1970, with the text ""a wrinkle in time, past meets present"". Allow YouTube content?

""Elton must never stop performing,"" his husbandDavid Furnish told Music Week last year.,external ""Some people relish the idea of a retirement where they do nothing [but] for Elton that would be purgatory."" However, he added: ""I think given our commitments to our kids and our family - and now our boys are nearly seven and five and at that point where they need you present more than ever - it's important we're there to support them.

Breaking|Breaking newsDisgraced US Olympics doctor jailedFormer US Olympic gym doctor Larry Nassar jailed for sexual abuse after emotionally-charged hearing.4m4 minutes agoUS & Canada,"The paedophile tried to claim his accusers ""fabricated"" allegations for money and fame Ex-US Olympic gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years after testimony from nearly 160 of his victims. The judge dismissed Nassar's attempted apology as insincere, saying he would ""be in darkness the rest of his life"". Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault against girls and young women, including Olympians. The 54-year-old had already been sentenced to 60 years for possession of child pornography. This video can not be played Larry Nassar speaks as judge says 'I've signed your death warrant' Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar during the sentencing: ""As much as it was my honour and privilege to hear the sister survivors, it was my honour and privilege to sentence you. ""Because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again."" She told the paedophile: ""You have not owned yet what you did. I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir. ""I've just signed your death warrant"". The 156 women who confronted a predator The judge who let survivors speak This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Following seven days of emotional testimony from Nassar's victims, he was given an opportunity to address the court. ""What I am feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma, and emotional destruction that all of you are feeling,"" he told the packed courtroom. ""There are no words to describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred,"" he added. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Lansing, Michigan Throughout the seven-day hearing, the stories have been strikingly similar - the former USA Gymnastics team doctor would call the women in for treatment, but instead of taking away their pain, he stole their innocence. Some were so young they didn't realise until years later that they had been sexually abused. As Larry Nassar sat in his prison overalls, just metres away from them, survivor after survivor looked him in the eye and reminded him of what he'd done to them. And that's been the most extraordinary thing about this hearing. While the content of their testimony has been harrowing, it's also been inspiring.Â  For survivors of sexual abuse it's hard to relive the experience, let alone do so in front of your attacker. Follow@BBCRajiniV,external But Judge Aquilina revealed he had written a letter to her after his guilty plea claiming his accusers had ""fabricated"" allegations to gain money and fame. Court spectators gasped as the judge read a passage in which Nassar said he had been ""manipulated"" into admitting his guilt. ""I was a good doctor because my treatments worked, and those patients that are now speaking out are the same ones that praised and came back over and over,"" Nassar wrote. He added in the letter: ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" As the judge finished her sentence, witnesses in the packed courtroom stood and applauded her verdict. His sentencing follows a week of harrowing testimony from scores of women, including Olympic gold medal gymnasts Aly Raisman and Jordyn Weiber. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony Their teammates, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, also revealed they had been abused by Nassar. In 2015, USA Gymnastics - the sport's top governing body - quietly cut ties with Nassar over allegations about his professional care. An investigation in 2014 resulted in a three-month suspension from Michigan State University (MSU), where he coached. But he continued to see patients until he was publicly accused of abuse in a 2016 report by the Indianapolis Star newspaper. This video can not be played Sister survivors condemn master manipulator Later that year, he was arrested and charged by Michigan officials with sexual contact with a child. A year later, he was sentenced for child abuse images found on his computer. Rachael Denhollander, who was one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, pointed the finger at MSU in court on Wednesday. ""How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth?"" Ms Denhollander, now a lawyer, asked as she described the abuse that occurred when she was 15 years old. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""No one believed because they did not listen,"" she said, recounting the several times victims told MSU of their allegations. ""Victims were silenced, intimidated, told they were receiving medical treatment, and at times sent back to be further abused. ""This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture when a predator can behave unabated."" Ms Denhollander said trauma at the abuse she suffered had ""cast a horrific shadow"" over her medical care when she gave birth to three children, including two daughters. Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon resigned over the scandal As the court adjourned on Wednesday, the US Olympic Committee (USOC) announced it would hold an independent investigation into the sex abuse scandal. ""The USOC has decided to launch an investigation by an independent third party to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have gone undetected for so long,"" USOC chief executive Scott Blackmun wrote in an open letter. On Tuesday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) said it would investigate MSU's original handling of the gymnasts' abuse claims. Late on Wednesday MSU President Lou Anna Simon resigned. After Nassar's sentence was read, lawmakers in the Michigan House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on her to resign. ""We have lost confidence in the ability of President Lou Anna K Simon to lead a transparent investigation, to implement changes that will ensure it never happens again, to protect students, and to lead Michigan State University forward,"" the resolution said.

'From a home and job to sleeping rough'," What's it like to have to bed down on the street at night? After central London, large numbers of rough sleepers can be found in coastal towns and resorts. Here, 12 people around the coast of England and Wales explain how easy it was to find themselves homeless. Brighton “I have been on the road for just over two years. My house was repossessed. I went on a downward spiral. I married the wrong man and then ended up in a bad situation. And then I ended up on the streets. I try not to think about it all. This doorway is sort of home from home for me now. I came to Brighton about four months ago. I got off the bus and sat down to beg for the money for another ticket - so I could carry on west. I was heading Devon way. I wasn't planning on staying here. My first night on the street I didn't have a sleeping bag or anything. In fact, I stood in front of an ambulance to get them to take me to A&E. And they did I spent my first homeless night under a blanket in there until they told me it was time to leave in the morning. And then I went straight to the nearest BHS and nicked a duvet. The second night was fine. Once I had a duvet I was all right.” “People give me all sort of things. When I got to Brighton I just had this one coat and a few toiletries. I had a really nice retro radio - but someone stole it first thing this morning when I got up and went off to the toilet in Starbucks. It's quite distinctive. The aerial's been broken off - the previous owner used it for a crack pipe. And the bit on the back that holds the batteries in is missing. But since then, just in that short time, another lady has bought me a new radio.” “On the streets we are one big family. I've always got food - so they know to come to me for something to eat or a Rizla. If someone comes up to me shaking, I'll give them money for a hot drink if I've got it. We just look out for each other. It's important we all stay warm. I am quite well insulated in this doorway - it's a good spot. I'm happy here. I don't want to use night shelters. To be honest, I am not that good at going indoors now. I'm not even good going in a shop. The thought of going inside for a whole night? No it doesn't appeal to me. Depression is so easy to kick in when you are away from people, away from conversation and just stuck in your own head. Here, I have no chance of getting depressed. There's always someone butting in - and taking me down a happy road.” Penryn, Cornwall “I'm from Inverness originally but I'm part of Penryn now. The whole town knows me. It's been nearly two and a half years altogether - sleeping rough. I moved down 10 years ago for a week's holiday - but I met the ex-missus. We ended up having two kids. We split up and I ended up homeless. I couldn't get back up north. So I have been here.” “I'm a plant mechanic. JCBs, diggers and all that. Well not in the last few years - but that's what I usually do. I wake up usually about 10 o'clock and go over to the Spar shop. I'll sit outside there and make money for my breakfast.” “I'm like the homeless Jeremy Kyle. People come to me with their problems. Always stay positive, that's my motto. This builder guy, he comes along most days. He had a heart scare and his wife makes him this packed lunch - and it's like all healthy stuff. He goes ‘There you go Brian, your lunch’. And I go ‘You've got to eat it man, else it's not good for you’. And he goes ‘No I'm going in the chippy, don't tell the missus’.” Since we met Brian, the homeless charity St Petroc's Society has helped him make the journey back to Inverness Brighton (Robert's name has been changed) “I was a bin man. I never had loads of money - but I was happy. It was simple. It was easy. But I fell down the wrong path with drugs - and I lost that life. It was all down to me - and I have to live with that decision every day as I sit here. I've been in Brighton since I was 21. I'm 38 now. I ended up going to jail because of the drugs. I spent two years in prison where I got three meals a day and a bed. I know it was jail, but it was safe - safer than the streets. When I was released, I wasn't a priority for housing. It's because I was fit and healthy and a single male with no partner.” “I was clean for two years in prison because I was on a drugs programme in there. I was going to go out straight into rehab. But it all fell through a week before I got out. So I came back out on the street and now I'm back on the drugs. At night that stuff is keeping me warm. It's stopping me worrying so much about all the horrible stuff going on around me. But I have now made contact with the drugs services and my doctors - and they are helping me.” “Brighton is the only place I have slept rough. I was brought up in care in Wales and moved around a lot. But because of my kids I don't really want to move away from here. There are people who help a lot. Cups of tea, sandwiches and other stuff. You do get people being quite abusive - shouting ‘get a job’ and things like that. I try to explain that if I had a place to stay, I could have a job. I only want a little room. I could then go to my drugs meetings and my other groups - and hopefully get into rehab. I want to have contact with my kids. I don't have that at the moment. They're quite young now, but I don't want to have the worry that one day they might see me on the street and they'll ignore me.” Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire “I'm 26 and was brought up in Cleethorpes. I've been homeless for about six months because of family troubles. I want somewhere to live and to get a job. Some people are horrible. They call you a smackhead and tell you to get a job. But others can be nice. They buy you some food and a cup of tea. At night I'm outside, so I team up with a friend. If they weren't there it would be scary. I don't feel safe unless I'm with someone.” Harbour Place Day Centre in Grimsby says it has offered help to Jade Camborne, Cornwall “I used to sleep in the dunes at Hayle near St Ives. But dog walkers started coming by and I think some guy saw the tent and reported me. So I started sleeping in my car. It was stolen and found burned out in Tesco car park. I'm going back a lot of years - for that short spell it was an absolute nightmare. I've now got a home, and I volunteer at Camborne Church to help give today's homeless a hot breakfast.” “Back in the 90s it was easy to get a mortgage. I had a career, a car, a house. And then over time there was a break up of a relationship and a change of a job. Then I lost job security. I took out a loan and got into financial problems. And then I ended up homeless. When you look back, you see that slippery slope.” “In the dunes it's beautiful, but in the middle of the night when you hear something outside the tent you think ‘oh my God’. I went to the night shelter - and one thing you do notice there is people's kindness. They make you feel more human again. Because you do feel like you have fallen into a crack somewhere. Like you are not really in society - out of sight. You feel like you could disappear and nobody would know. And yes, just that one intervention picked me up. It does take a while to get yourself established again, but that bit of help just makes that difference. If I hadn't had that help, I don't know where I would be. I'm 50 now and I've got a flat, a job, a life.” Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire “I'm 24 and I've lived in this town most of my life. I'm sleeping on the streets. I've been in a doorway for the past three weeks. I've been put on a methadone script, so I'm not having to take heroin. It's a substitute. I found myself homeless because I was not dealing with my problems really. I never learned how to cope - and then I started using drugs and quickly became addicted. It snowballed to where I was thieving. And you can't sustain a property because you are sustaining a drug habit. You find that you are running around all day for drugs, and not focusing on what you should be.” “I've only been coming to the Harbour Place Day Centre for a few weeks, but it gives me a reason to get up in the morning. I know that I can get a hot drink and see a couple of friendly faces. I can get a hot shower, clean clothes and something to eat. I've had people call me ‘tramp’ or ‘druggie’. The people who do call you names are the younger people. They don't know anything really.” West Cornwall “We once had a nice post guy up at Chiverton Cross roundabout. I was desperate to get some documentation sent, and said ‘I know this sounds far-fetched, but if I put an address to The Bushes, Chiverton Cross roundabout...’ And he just laughed and said ‘Of course I'll do it for you’. So you've got to use your imagination sometimes to get an address. I got the post through.” “Yeah it plays havoc on your mental health. I do suffer with anxiety issues. And I'm cooped up, living in my van. Cornwall's not exactly the sunshine region, is it? You get three days of rain on the trot - and then you're really starting to go la-la in the head. There are organisations [where I can get a shower] and they help as much as they can. But to be honest they're getting so overcooked with people.” “I do probably six months of work a year - agricultural work mainly. Flower picking at the moment. We all get into ruts. But by the time you've worked through the system of being homeless and getting in a shelter - it can be anything up to 18 months. By then, that person is ruined. But it's OK [officially], because it's a statistic, they've actually helped that person. They are helping. But they're not actually helping the person.” West Cornwall “We once had a nice post guy up at Chiverton Cross roundabout. I was desperate to get some documentation sent, and said ‘I know this sounds far-fetched, but if I put an address to The Bushes, Chiverton Cross roundabout...’ And he just laughed and said ‘Of course I'll do it for you’.

But it's OK [officially], because it's a statistic, they've actually helped that person. They are helping. But they're not actually helping the person.” Falmouth, Cornwall Tony (right): “Some people are nice. Down the Maritime Museum, they've been good as gold. And I have got friends who work in businesses in Falmouth. They'll come out and say ‘Tony here's a pasty for you. Here's a coffee for you. I don't want a thank you my darling’.” “My mum and dad passed away. I then moved in with my brother and he passed away. Then I lost my job. I ended up losing my home. My son is 15 and lives with his mother. He worries loads about me. I'm 50. I've been out of my home about four months now. But the way I'm thinking at the moment, I can't handle it any more. I'm feeling really bad about it. It's not nice. People think all homeless people are alcoholics - but all I want is something hot to eat and drink.” “I've been to the council, I've been to everybody. I said ‘Can you please help me?’ All they do is put me in a bedsit for a couple of days - and that's not what I want. I want to be near my son in Truro. That's where he lives.” Terry: “Apart from 10 years, I've basically lived here in Falmouth all my life. I spent six years living with my mother in Penryn. I went back and forth. Now she's in a nursing home. I have worked in the past. Six years at Asda, a year for the Royal Duchy. I've also done some voluntary work for the Salvation Army. It can be so demoralising out here. Especially at this time of year when it's cold, wet and horrible. You get used to it, but I want a nice warm place.” Anglesey, North Wales (Darren's name has been changed) “We moved here, to Benllech on Anglesey, from Lancashire when I was I was about 12. It was a big change. Which is why I made the decision to apply for college and university in London. Basically I was 16, I realised I was gay, and I didn't want to hang around here. I trained in IT, then medicine, and then back into IT - because obviously there was a lot more money in it and fewer hours. Later, I moved to the US to be a manager for a big company. Life was very good. I was on an excellent salary. Stock options, bonuses. At one time I was on $300,000 a year.” “But gradually as my health deteriorated and I could no longer do my job. I had to take early retirement. I've got arthritis fibromyalgia, tendinopathy - plus a whole list of problems. For the six years in the US that I was out of work, I just lived on my savings and raided my private pension - which you are allowed to do there. In hindsight I should have come back here much sooner. Then in September 2015 I had a stroke - and I was back on Anglesey for good. After six months of physio, I was able to walk. But I still can't walk that far. But I can talk fine.” “I ended up back living with family members. I suppose you could call it sofa surfing for about eight months. I had no daily routine. I was just existing. In the end, I went to the council and admitted I was homeless. They put me in bed and breakfast - and that's when The Wallich charity got in touch. They helped me get private rented accommodation, liaising with the landlord. It was a real low point. I had been a really strong person before, in charge of a team of 70 people.” “I'm in a pretty good state now. You adapt to the situation you are in. I do volunteer work. I get out and about as much as I can. I have established new friends. I kind of despised this place when I was young - but now I love it.” Swansea “I grew up in Surrey. I was born in Reigate. My parents divorced when I was quite young and I lived with my father - he was an alcoholic. In fact that's what killed him. He died in my arms. I got seven O-levels and an A-level at school. When I left I became a golf professional for a few years. I was earning £1,000 a week teaching people how to play golf. But I often think I was earning too much money at such a young age. I went out clubbing in south London and because I had so much money in my pocket, I didn't care about flashing it about. And it got me into a fair bit of trouble with regards to drinking and socialising.” “I moved to Dorking, near the golf club. I was renting a three-bedroom house in a really nice area. And I had my first serious relationship with a girl - we lasted seven years. But then, when I switched from golf to running pubs, she said she couldn't handle me drinking all the time. She gave me a choice. It was either her or the alcohol. Unfortunately I said I couldn't commit to her. I was drinking every day.” “I got together with another girl. She had a daughter through me. But again my drinking got quite bad. I had three jobs on the go to keep the mortgage and look after our daughter as well. My girlfriend said I had to decide between my daughter or drink. I chose drink. Now I'm sober, I realise it's probably the most awful thing I've ever done in my life.” “My daughter will now be 18. I want to make contact, but my key workers and my family say I need to get mentally strong first - and I tend to agree with that. She could either say ‘I don't know you’ - and I would just go straight back to an off licence or pub. And I know I would soon be six feet under. Or she could say ‘I want a relationship with my father’ - and that would be brilliant. That would make my life probably. Not just my year, it would make my life.” “After I left my girlfriend and baby daughter I moved to Dorset to work in a mate's pub. But he couldn't make it pay and he had to sell up. I lost my lodgings over the pub - and that's when I became homeless, back in about 2006-07. I ended up in Swansea because of a Welsh woman I met on the streets in Dorset. One day she suggested moving to Wales. I'd never been there before, but I said ‘Yeah go on, I'll give it a go’. And then one morning in Swansea, she asked me for some money. I gave her £20, and that was the last time I saw her. She got a bus over to Cardiff. By all accounts she's doing really well. She doesn't drink any more, she's got a good job, her own flat.” “Just before I had my first stroke, about two years ago, I realised I couldn't cope [on the streets] any more. You begin to really feel it - my body was giving me signs. And then I got involved in an altercation. I was basically battered beyond belief. Luckily, the police found me outside Primark. I think I was at Morriston Hospital - I don't remember much about it to be honest. They found something wrong with my brain - by being beaten up constantly over the years, plus falling over drunk. And then I had another stroke in April 2016. I had two blood clots on the left-hand side of my brain - and that's why my right-hand side now doesn't work well.” “I now have a room thanks to the charity, The Wallich. A few months ago, my support worker took me to meet my mother and brother in Swindon - a neutral place. My mother was very quiet. I can understand that she might have been overwhelmed by it all. The last time she saw me was years ago, and I was probably out of my head drunk. I now want to work for a homeless project like this one, because homelessness has been almost a quarter of my life. I don't go into central Swansea that often now, because I feel I could be led up the wrong path - by acquaintances rather than friends. And I can't afford to do that any more.” “My daughter will now be 18. I want to make contact, but my key workers and my family say I need to get mentally strong first - and I tend to agree with that.

And I can't afford to do that any more.” Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire “I've been in this situation since about 2000 - on and off. Just going to jail and then coming out. You get used to it. I don't know anything else really. It's just the way it is for me. I'm from Cleethorpes. I was about 16 and had just left school. I didn't have any dreams. Didn't know what I wanted to be. Just wanted to leave school. I had family, but you just grow up and move.” “This morning I was in a doorway in a sleeping bag, and at half past five someone came and woke me up. He kicked me - started stamping on me with a foot. ‘Oi you. You can't sleep there. You can't sleep there’. I don't look too bad at the minute - so when I stood up he changed his tune. When he saw I was smartly dressed, he said ‘Oh sorry mate’. But that's wrong. If I was a scruffy homeless person would it be OK to kick me and tell me to get out? No.” “With my mental health deteriorating - me being on the streets isn't helping. And being in jail isn't helping me either. It's just getting worse by the day. It's a horrible feeling. Someone says ‘explain it to me’ - but I can't. I wouldn't expect people to understand - because I don't understand what's going on.” Robert and Darren's names have been changed in orderto protect their identities Built with Shorthand"

First monkey clones created in the lab,"This video can not be played The animals may be useful for studying cancers and immune disorders. Two monkeys have been cloned using the technique that produced Dolly the sheep. Identical long-tailed macaques Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were born several weeks ago at a laboratory in China. Scientists say populations of monkeys that are genetically identical will be useful for research into human diseases. But critics say the work raises ethical concerns by bringing the world closer to human cloning. Qiang Sun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience said the cloned monkeys will be useful as a model for studying diseases with a genetic basis, including some cancers, metabolic and immune disorders. ""There are a lot of questions about primate biology that can be studied by having this additional model,"" he said. Zhong Zhong was created by somatic cell nuclear transfer Zhong Zhong was born eight weeks ago and Hua Hua six weeks ago. They are named after the Mandarin term for the Chinese nation and people. The researchers say the monkeys are being bottle fed and are currently growing normally. They expect more macaque clones to be born over the coming months. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge of The Francis Crick Institute, London, said the technique used to clone Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua remains ""a very inefficient and hazardous procedure"". ""The work in this paper is not a stepping-stone to establishing methods for obtaining live born human clones,"" he said. WATCH: Dolly - the world's most famous sheep Prof Darren Griffin of the University of Kent said the approach may be useful in understanding human diseases, but raised ethical concerns. ""Careful consideration now needs to be given to the ethical framework under which such experiments can, and should, operate,"" he said. Dolly made history 20 years ago after being cloned at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. It was the first time scientists had been able to clone a mammal from an adult cell, taken from the udder. Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned 20 years ago Since then many other mammals have been cloned using the same somatic cell nuclear transfer technique (SCNT), including cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, mice and rats. This involves transferring DNA from the nucleus of a cell to a donated egg cell, which has had its own DNA removed. This is then prompted to develop into an embryo and implanted in a surrogate animal. Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are the first non-human primates cloned through this technique. In 1999, a rhesus monkey embryo was split in two in order to create two identical twins. One of the baby monkeys born through that technique - called Tetra - has the title of the world's first cloned monkey, but it did not involve the complex process of DNA transfer. In the study, published in the journal Cell,,externalscientists used DNA from foetal cells. After the DNA was transferred to donated eggs, genetic reprogramming was used to alter genes that would otherwise have stopped the embryo developing. Hua Hua was born six weeks ago in a Shanghai lab Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were the result of 79 attempts. Two other monkeys were initially cloned from a different type of cell, but failed to survive. Dr Sun said: ""We tried several different methods, but only one worked. There was much failure before we found a way to successfully clone a monkey."" The scientists say they followed strict international guidelines for animal research, set by the US National Institutes of Health. Co-researcher Dr Muming Poo, also of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, said: ""We are very aware that future research using non-human primates anywhere in the world depends on scientists following very strict ethical standards.""

Man 'jumped on Finsbury Park attacker',"A man accused of driving a van into people near a London mosque blew a kiss and smiled as he was put in a police vehicle after the alleged attack, a court has heard. A witness told the jury he would never forget the driver's ""constant smiling"". Darren Osborne, 48, is accused of ploughing into worshippers in Finsbury Park in June last year, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. Mr Osborne, from Cardiff, denies murder and attempted murder. The court has already heard that the area was busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers at the time, and witnesses - including those who helped to apprehend the man - have been describing how events unfolded. In a statement, one bystander, Susan Can, told Woolwich Crown Court he was detained by police and put in the back of their van in front of a ""very angry"" crowd. ""As he was sat in there, I saw him blow a kiss at the crowd. This made them angrier still,"" she said. Another witness, Adnan Mohamud, said he recalled the driver lying on the floor with a smile on his face, saying: ""I have done my job, you can kill me now."" ""Something I will never forget was that he was constantly smiling,"" Mr Mohamud added. ""I knew at this point that what he did was not an accident - it was definitely deliberate."" Jurors earlier heard how a crowd had gathered around Makram Ali after he collapsed at the roadside before the alleged attack. Mr Mohamud called 999 for an ambulance, and in a recording played to the jury, he is heard speaking to the operator before a loud noise and shouts of distress. The operator can be heard saying ""hello"" 24 times before a male voice comes back on the line to say ""someone's just come with a big van and run over a load of people."" Ibrahim Benaounda had been tending to Mr Ali when he was struck, the jury heard. ""It felt like being on a rollercoaster, and spinning round and round. I could feel everything. I could feel my bones breaking,"" he told the court in his statement. Another witness, Hamdi Alfaiq, 38, who walked into the courtroom on crutches, had been offering Mr Ali a sip of water before he was hit and woke from consciousness under the van, the court heard. He told the jury: ""They pulled me out but I don't remember anything from when I was underneath."" Another witness, Mohamoud Geedi, 28, told the court he was knocked over by the van's wing mirror, but got up and launched himself at the driver. Mr Geedi said he had seen a white van speeding up and heard the noise of gears changing as it turned into Whadcoat Street, shortly after midnight on 19 June last year. ""I see the big white van, I can see the headlights. I can hear a rev,"" he said. ""I could see there was one driver that was in the vehicle. It was going towards us."" Another eyewitness, Mahad Mohamed Ismail, said in a statement it seemed as if the driver's foot was ""flat"" on the pedal as the vehicle moved towards the crowd. The attack happened during the month of Ramadan Describing the scene after the van struck the crowd, Mr Geedi said: ""I looked at a lot of people just splattered all over the place."" He told jurors the van only stopped when it hit some bollards, and the driver ran towards the crowd ""with his head down, punching, lots of people were trying to grab him"". He and others wrestled the driver to the ground, and tried to punch and kick him until a local imam intervened, saying: ""It's not worth it,"" Mr Geedi said. The imam, Mohammed Mahmoud, told the court the driver was facing punches ""from almost every direction"". He said he urged people not to touch the man after he had been stopped from fleeing the scene. Mr Mahmoud added: ""He posed no harm to anybody. He was immobilised. ""He wasn't a threat and therefore he should answer for his crime in a court such as this, which he is doing now, and not in a court in the streets."" The jury was also shown footage of the driver swearing and laughing after his arrest outside Islington police station. In the video from a police body-worn camera, the man is heard making comments about the Rotherham grooming scandal, Sadiq Khan, Grenfell Tower, the Iraq war.

Worboys' victims 'told he would serve life'A Crown Prosecution Service lawyer gave John Worboys' victims written assurances about his sentence.12m12 minutes agoLondon,"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them Victims of rapist John Worboys were given written assurances about how long he would spend in jail after he was convicted, it has emerged. The CPS told victims the indeterminate term he received was ""to all intents and purposes"" a life sentence. Letters featuring the details, sent to his victims, have been seen by the BBC. Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers. News that the Parole Board haddecided to free Worboys after a decade behind barswas met with a furore by his victims and in Parliament. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Fresh Worboys sex attack claim investigated After Worboys' trial in 2009, the special casework lawyer for the CPS, Anthony Connell, wrote to victims to explain the sentencing process. He said: ""An indeterminate sentence is a new sentence that has been introduced only a few years ago. ""To all intents and purposes, it is a sentence of life imprisonment."" John Worboys was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 Mr Connell said it meant Worboys could apply for release after serving his minimum term. ""Merely because he is allowed to apply after eight years, does not mean that he will be granted parole,"" he wrote. ""It is clear from the judge's sentencing remarks that he is considered a dangerous offender. ""Those responsible for considering any application by him will no doubt have in mind this fact together with the fact that he committed an awful lot of serious offences."" Mr Connell, who retired in 2015, concluded his letter by saying he hoped the conviction and sentence had brought the victims ""some peace of mind"". Anthony Connell said Worboys had been given a life sentence ""to all intents and purposes"" Five days after Worboys' trial ended, Det Insp David Reid wrote to the victims and confirmed 85 women had come forward to police. He also set out a series of questions victims wanted answering, including: ""Is he [Worboys] likely to be charged with other offences now?"" Det Insp Reid replied: ""No. This is partly because of the lengthy sentence anticipated. Also, given the significant publicity that the case has attracted, it is unlikely that he would be able to obtain a further fair trial."" The Scotland Yard detective went on to say that Worboys was a ""unique offender"" who was ""dangerous"" and had ""exacerbated the distress by refusing to accept what he has done"". Det Insp David Reid said Worboys was unlikely to be charged with more offences At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. As well as being ordered to serve at least eight years, Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence, meaning he could be kept in prison as for as long as he was deemed to remain a danger to the public. Newspapers threaten Worboys legal action Fresh Worboys sex assault claim Ministers won't challenge Worboys release Rapist's jail move bid refused in 2015 'No plans' to review Worboys rape claims The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Michelle Sadio: Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside London church Bach manuscript among items worth more than Â£45 million donated to UK museums Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Police concerned for 'vulnerable' missing man with autism last seen in north London Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Hundreds of court cases axed over failingsAbout 900 cases were dropped last year due to police or the CPS failing to disclose evidence, figures show.2h2 hours agoUK","This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The number of prosecutions in England and Wales that collapsed because of a failure by police or prosecutors to disclose evidence increased by 70% in the last two years, the BBC can reveal. Last year, 916 people had charges dropped over a failure to disclose evidence - up from 537 in 2014-15. It comes after recent collapsed rape cases highlighted a failure to share evidence with defence solicitors. The Crown Prosecution Service said the justice system had ""systemic"" problems. In the lead up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence that might either assist the defence case or undermine the prosecution's. However, the recent collapse of several rape cases has heightened concerns that evidence is not being disclosed early enough, and that the rules are not being followed. CPS chief insists justice system is working Collapsed rape trials could hamper convictions, says Lord Judge WATCH: Why disclosure failings can prove crucial In December, the trial of Liam Allan, who faced 12 counts of rape and sexual assault, was halted. The case against Mr Allan was dropped when it emerged evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed messages from the alleged victim pestering him for ""casual sex"". Liam Allan's case was dropped after evidence emerged on a computer disc - which police had looked through Last week, a rape charge against Oxford University student Oliver Mearswas dropped on the eve of his trial,after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. Surrey Police admitted its investigation had been flawed and launched an internal review. Surrey's Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""For too long disclosure has been seen by many officers as something that is subsequent to an investigation, ie. an administrative process at the end, rather than something that should be integral."" He acknowledged it was ""no small task"" to train the police force to think differently, but an improvement plan would be published shortly. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Suddenly, disclosure is a hot topic. It used to be seen as a rather dry part of the trial process which no one quite understood. Occasionally, there would be a headline about a miscarriage of justice because evidence was not disclosed; a review would be set up with a promise that ""lessons will be learned"", before the issue disappeared again. But the recent spate of collapsed rape prosecutions has highlighted that disclosure is not some theoretical concept but a vital legal procedure that affects people's lives. The CPS figures demonstrate that these are not isolated cases and although the number of disclosure-related failed prosecutions is comparatively small, it is increasing. There have been three official reports into disclosure in seven years (Lord Justice Gross, Richard Horwell, CPS inspectorate) but only now, it seems, is there a determination among police and prosecutors to grip the issue. Jerry Hayes, the prosecuting barrister in Liam Allan's case, fears innocent people were ""probably"" being jailed because of disclosure failings. ""And it may have been some time ago and it may well be that evidence is destroyed. Their lives are now destroyed,"" he told the Today programme. Julia Smart, defence counsel for Liam Allan, said she was not surprised by the BBC's figures, saying she and her colleagues believed ""objective investigation"" was not happening. She said it was partly down to resources but police also needed to consider all possible lines of inquiry, not just focus on building up a case, and the prosecution should not be holding onto evidence. This video can not be played Samuel Armstrong said his life had been ""turned upside down"" by allegations Samuel Armstrong, an aide to Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, was cleared by a jury of raping a woman after evidence was handed over just before his trial. He said he and the woman had been drinking and dancing to jazz music before having consensual sex in the MP's Westminster office. The court heard the woman had given the story to journalists 15 hours after the pair had sex. Mr Armstrong told BBC 5 live his message to director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders was: ""You say that there is a problem and that you recognise it. You describe it as irritating and disappointing. ""For the young people involved it's much more - it's devastating,"" he said. ""If you think there's a problem, if you recognise that this is an issue, why don't you apologise to me, to Liam Allan and to all of the other young victims."" The new figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal the total number of people whose trials have ended or the charges against them dropped due to a failure to disclose evidence. Over a four-year period, the number of completed prosecutions fell by almost 150,000 cases - from more than 736,000 in 2013-14 to just over 588,000 in 2016-17. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, blamed issues on a ""lack of investment, training and attention to the criminal justice system"". She said barristers face ""a daily struggle in respect of disclosure, delays and all the other disastrous consequences of a system that is openly described by MPs as at breaking point"". ""The reasons for it must be properly explored and dealt with,"" she added. She said Richard Foster, chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission,had written,externalto the director of public prosecutions and the attorney general 18 months ago about the problem. A CPS spokesperson said the number of dropped cases due to evidence disclosure failures represented just 0.15% of the total number of prosecutions. ""That is still too many, however, and we are clear that there are systemic disclosure issues across the criminal justice system which will require a collective effort in order to bring about improvement. ""Getting this right is a priority, and along with the police and other criminal justice partners we are working to improve how we fulfil these vital disclosure obligations.""

Consultants and GPs said they could not get blood and X-Ray results because their internal portal was down. The Welsh Government has since confirmed that all systems are now back up and running. But it warned ""there may be a backlog affecting some areas"". The National Cyber Security Centre said the problems were caused by technical issues and were not the result of a cyber attack. The problems did not lead to any data security issues, according to the Welsh Government's department of health and social services Allow Twitter content?

The British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales, which represents doctors, said it understood at least half of GP services had been affected. One GP called the situation ""chaos"" and said: ""I can't do anything. I need this system for everything."" Earlier, a warning on doctors' computers read that ""multiple services are affected, especially national services"". Bangor family GP Dr Catrin Elis Williams described the situation as ""very frustrating and rather dangerous"". Her computer system went down about lunchtime on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately it's caused us quite a lot of problems with trying to get patients' results, past medical histories and letters from hospitals,"" she said. ""We have seen a few people we can't help because we can't get that information."" Doctors saw this message when they tried to access the Welsh NHS portal The fact the system went down also meant staff could not get phone numbers of patients to contact them and cancel appointments. Other problems included the fact notes from appointments could not be typed up and saved, meaning there will be a backlog. ""The system has gone down before but only for short periods,"" she added. Philip Young, 48, from Caerphilly went to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport on Wednesday to find out the results of a biopsy he had taken from a mass on his vocal chords two weeks before Christmas. But he was told the results were not available due to the systems being down and that he should return in a month. His ex-partner Emma Noble said it was ""very concerning"" and she was ""annoyed for him"". ""To have to wait another month is completely unacceptable, we could be talking about cancer here,"" she said. ""It's not just something you can leave."" Doctors saw this message on their computer screens when trying to access the Welsh NHS portal Ms Noble said she had called the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board complaints line, but it was inundated and she would have to call back in the morning. The assembly's opposition health spokesman Angela Burns said the problems were ""incredibly concerning, especially in the aftermath of last year's ransomware attack on the NHS."" ""The focus must now be on supporting these centres to manage this incident swiftly so that patient data is secure and that care is not adversely affected,"" said the Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. ""This is under investigation by the NHS Wales Informatics Service and is being dealt with as a priority,"" a Welsh Government spokesman added. Powys NHS IT department said: ""There is currently a major incident affecting a number of nationally hosted systems across NHS Wales. What is a computer server? ""The issue appears related to national firewalls and is being currently investigated.'"" Dr Alan Woodall, chairman of GP Survival UK who works from a surgery in Montgomeryshire, said: ""Myself and colleagues that work in primary care cannot access electronic patient records which is severely inhibiting our ability to provide patient care."" Another doctor, working from a GP Surgery in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area that covers Swansea and Bridgend, described it as ""chaos"", adding: ""I can't do anything. I need this system for everything."" A consultant at Morriston Hospital in Swansea told the BBC he could not access blood and X-Ray results on his computer because their internal intranet portal is not working. A senior registrar at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant said the problems started mid-morning on Wednesday.

Federer into 14th Australian Open semi,"Defending champion Federer has won the Australian Open five times 2018 Australian Open Dates:15-28 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Watch highlights on BBC Two, the BBC Sport website and app. Live commentary on the best matches on BBC Radio 5 live, 5 live sports extra and online. Defending champion Roger Federer reached his 14th Australian Open semi-final with a straight-set victory over Tomas Berdych. Second seed Federer, 36, beat the Czech 19th seed 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 6-4 in the Rod Laver Arena night session. It was their 10th meeting at Grand Slams, and an eighth win for the Swiss player. Federer goes on to face unseeded 21-year-old Hyeon Chung of South Korea in the last four on Friday. Britain's Kyle Edmund takes on sixth seed Marin Cilic of Croatia in the first semi-final at 08:30 GMT on Thursday. Read more: Simona Halep to face Angelique Kerber in semi-finals Media are 'demonising' me - Sandgren Edmund better & fitter than ever - McEnroe Edmund ready for 'great opportunity' to reach final Roger Federer shares a joke with Jim Courier following his victory Federer's most recent win over Berdych was a straight-sets victory in last year's Wimbledon semi-final, and he prevailed again in similar fashion to take his career record against the Czech to 20-6. Berdych, 32, made a strong start, capitalising on a surprisingly loose Federer to move 3-0 ahead, and serving for the set at 5-3. A set point went begging, however, and Federer reclaimed the break at the fourth opportunity, despite an argument with umpire Fergus Murphy over Hawkeye. Berdych had a second chance to grab the set when Federer double-faulted but, having worked his way into the rally, could only fire a backhand long. Federer needed no more help as he raced through the tie-break, sealing it with an exquisite drop shot. The Swiss made the decisive move in the second set at 4-3, swatting away a beautiful backhand before charging into the net to fire another on break point. With the second set wrapped up moments later, Berdych headed off court for treatment to his back, but showed no sign of injury on his return. Federer was giving him enough problems, the Swiss even mastering line calling when he broke at 1-1 in the third set. The world number two stopped mid-rally to challenge a ball near the baseline and was proved correct by one millimetre when Hawkeye gave its verdict. Berdych would rally one final time with a fizzing forehand return but after Federer made it three breaks in a row with a brilliant backhand, he was not about to let the Czech back in. ""I hung around, got a bit lucky, a bit angry, a frustrated, maybe at the umpire, but I actually thought the call was good anyway!"" said Federer. ""I was just frustrated and a bit antsy. I'm happy I got out of that first set. It ended up being key to the match. Tomas was great.""

Call for road pricing tailored to drivers,"Motorists should be charged for using the UK's road network based on personal circumstances, a new report says. Drivers currently pay fuel and vehicle taxes, but road pricing is limited to certain toll roads and schemes such as London's congestion charge. However, a group of infrastructure engineers has said that approach is ""failing"", because revenue from those existing taxes is ""drying up"". The government said it was investing Â£15bn in the road network. The Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE), which represents companies involved in designing the UK's infrastructure, admitted some people were suspicious of road pricing. However,in its report ""Funding Roads for the Future"",externalit said charges for road usage should be introduced which took into account: whether a driver's journey was on motorways or country lanes the time of day how much congestion was on the network drivers' financial circumstances - for example, whether they were students, pensioners or unemployed ACE said relying on money raised through fuel duty, Vehicle Excise Duty and the HGV levy was outdated. ""The growing uptake of zero-emission vehicles means revenue from Vehicle Excise Duty and Fuel Duty will continue to decline as a percentage of the UK's GDP in the future,"" it said. Changing social trends, including ride sharing and increased urbanisation, meant there was less need for personal transport, it added. As a result car ownership was falling and that was putting pressure on revenues, creating ""problems for the funding of roads"". However, a Treasury spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that our roads are fit for purpose, and that's why we are investing Â£15bn in our Road Investment Strategy. ""We are also supporting hardworking people across the country by freezing fuel duty for the eighth year in a row, saving drivers Â£160 a year on average."" ACE said there had been four decades of underinvestment in roads. ""Our report argues that in the years ahead only a reformed funding regime based on dynamic road user pricing will manage traffic flows and deliver the significant investment needed to keep the country moving,"" said the association's chief executive, Nelson Ogunshakin. He said it was ""vital"" that the government starts these conversations now, as there are fears ""people will be priced off the road"". ""This doesn't have to be the case and there is a great opportunity to develop a fairer-for-all road funding system which delivers the first-class road network that this country needs long into the future,"" said Mr Ogunshakin.

WH Smith High Street sales still falling,"WH Smith's High Street sales have continued to fall, but the bookseller and stationer has had another rise in sales at its travel outlets. In the 20-week period to 20 January, sales in High Street stores were down 5%, with like-for-like sales falling by 4%, in line with expectations. The company said this was partly down to fewer spoof humour books being sold compared with the same time last year. However, total sales in travel were up 7%, with like-for-like sales rising 3%. Total sales were flat year-on-year and like-for-like sales down 1% over the 20-week period. Like-for-like sales, a common measure of retailers' performance, strip out the effect of new store openings. The pattern, both on the High Street and at travel outlets, was unchanged from earlier in 2017. Group chief executive Stephen Clarke said: ""Our travel business now accounts for almost two-thirds of the group's annual profit and we continue to deliver strong sales growth across all our key channels. ""This was driven by ongoing investment in the business and continued growth in passenger numbers in our airport stores over the Christmas period."" He added that the company's UK store programme was on track, with 15 new units expected to open this year. The new large airport stores at Gatwick and Stansted opened during the reporting period and both performed well. The company will continue with its cost efficiency programme and expects full-year cost savings to be about Â£12m, slightly ahead of its target.

Newspapers threaten Worboys legal action,"The papers are calling for the Parole Board's report on John Worboys' release Two newspapers have threatened legal action if the Parole Board does not publish its reasons for agreeing to release convicted rapist John Worboys. The Sun,externalandthe Daily Mail,externalhave written to the board and Justice Secretary David Gauke demanding the report. If they do not release it within seven days, the papers have said they will apply for a judicial review. Both the board and Ministry of Justice said they are legally prohibited from disclosing Parole Board decisions. Cabbie who preyed on young women Ministers won't challenge Worboys release Former black-cab driver Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers. After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. The decision was met with a furore by Worboys' victims and in Parliament. On Tuesday Scotland Yard confirmed it is investigatinga new allegation of sexual assault made against him this month- though dating back to 1997 - which could delay his release date if it leads to criminal charges. No arrests have been made. Worboys was transferred from high-security prison HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in south-east London at the weekend - prompting fresh outrage that he may be allowed to return to the capital. A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. The Sun said the ""secretive system"" of the Parole Board should end, adding that the report on Worboys' release was ""integral to the debate on a matter of profound public interest"" where there was ""overwhelming public concern"". The Daily Mail said Worboys' crimes were of such ""severity"" that ""normal rules should be set aside"". Two women - a victim and a second woman who says Worboys attacked her in 2003, although her complaints never reached court - have already threatened to launch a judicial review. Worboys is expected to be released in January The government had been considering the possibility of a legal challenge to Worboys's release, but Mr Gauke told the House of Commons that, after consulting lawyers,it would not be appropriate to proceed. However, Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed there would be a review into the way parole is considered. Both the Parole Board and the MoJ said they were legally prohibited from disclosing Parole Board decisions or evidence and they backed the review already announced.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over NHS funding - here are the key bits of their exchanges.,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have gone head-to-head at Prime Minister's Questions. What happened? Boris Johnson handed Jeremy Corbyn a gift on Tuesday when he called for extra funding for the NHS -  and the Labour leader took it with both hands. The foreign secretary was reported to have demanded an extra Â£5bn a year for the health service in England. This is the same figure Labour has been calling for. This video can not be played Does PM agree with Boris Johnson over NHS cash? Theresa May said the NHS had been given Â£6bn extra in November's Budget - but that was dubbed ""thin gruel"" by the Labour leader as it would be spread over three years. He quoted a letter signed 68 senior A&E doctors, who said people were dying prematurely. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And here is BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict: Jeremy Corbyn sort of won that. The Labour leader had some well prepared questions and evoked the horrible scenes of distressed patients that appeared on the news earlier this week. The prime minister parried his complaints with statistics - so it was a match between passion and figures. And passion won. Mr Corbyn did not propose solutions beyond calling for more money to be spent, but the manner of the PM's response left her vulnerable to his charge that she is ""in denial"" about the state of the NHS. She was much better, because she was much more spontaneous, when she was asked about restrictions on the availability of smear tests. The foreign secretary wasn't there. Perhaps it was just as well. The mockery of his Channel bridge proposal, and the Opposition's gleeful support of his call for a cash injection for the NHS would have made for an uncomfortable 45 minutes on the front bench. And the attacks he prompted will not stop with this question timeâ¦. Oh and Education Minister Anne Milton's performance answering an Urgent Question on the President's Club  ""charity dinner"" suggests the government has found a new front bench star. Her light was hidden under a bushel while she was deputy chief whip, but she gave a masterclass in how to answer a difficult question in a way that was personal, passionate and effectiveâ¦ the PM should take a moment to watch and learn.

Antiques dealer admits strangling daughter,"Robert Peters denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter A wealthy antiques dealer has admitted strangling his seven-year-old daughter with a dressing gown cord. Robert Peters, 55, is accused of attacking Sophia at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London, in November. Peters denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The prosecutor did not accept his plea and there will be a trial at the Old Bailey from 23 April. The trial is expected to last for two weeks. Peters, of Blenheim Road, was remanded in custody. A further case management hearing was set for 28 March. Sophia was rushed to hospital on 3 November and placed on a life support machine, but she died the following day.

UK unemployment falls to 1.44 million,"UK unemployment fell by 3,000 to 1.44 million in the three months to November, official figures show. The number of those in work increased sharply and wages rose at their fastest rate in almost a year, the Office for National Statistics said. That leaves the UK's unemployment rate at a four-decade low of 4.3%. But the growth in wages at 2.4% remained below inflation at 3.1% in November, leaving real wages lower for than a year earlier. ""Demand for workers clearly remained strong,"" said ONS statistician David Freeman. ""Nevertheless, inflation remains higher than pay growth and so the real value of earnings continues to decline."" The pace of job creation was faster than economists had predicted. The ONS said the number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the three months to November, taking total employment to a record 32.2 million. Higher consumer price inflation, due to weaker sterling, has left real pay 0.5% lower than a year earlier, but rising wages are beginning to close the gap. ""Today's jobs numbers once again strongly suggest that the UK economy is on a firmer footing than many had anticipated following the EU referendum vote,"" commented James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The labour market is tighter than it's been in decades. Unemployment is at a 42-year low of 4.3%. And in 17 years there have never been more vacancies: 810,000 of them. That high demand for labour should combine with a slower supply in the past year to produce a higher price of labour. Translation: higher wages. It should mean workers have greater bargaining power - and therefore greater capacity to bid up their wages. And employers who want workers the most should start to pay more to attract them. And indeed, there was a modest uptick in average earnings - now Â£490 a week, up Â£11 a week or 2.4% from last year (versus 2.3% previously). But it's still less than inflation - a real-terms pay cut of 0.5%. Why aren't workers demanding more? Here's a clue that may partly explain it. There's been a shift as the number of self-employed people drops and the number of full-time employees rises. In a climate of continuing economic uncertainty, many workers are only now getting the job security they would like. Before you demand a bigger pay rise, you first have to get over your relief at finding a secure full-time job. Mr Athey said the better-than-expected jobs figures went ""some way"" to justifying the Bank of England's November interest rate rise. But he said shrinking real wages continued to put pressure on consumer spending, which was the linchpin of the UK economy, ""a reminder that the economy is not on completely stable ground."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the data showed ""the UK jobs engine kicking back into life"". He said a tighter labour market, with higher demand for the available workers, would make the Bank of England more likely to raise interest rates. ""If this pattern of solid jobs growth and a gradual pick-up in earnings growth were to persist through the year, then this could push the MPC towards a further interest rate rise later in 2018."" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said he expected wage growth to edge higher this year: ""The worst of the squeeze on incomes is probably behind us."" However, Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said new technology and global competition were still weakening workers' bargaining power: ""It looks like low wages now explain low unemployment, rather than low unemployment acting as a catalyst for better pay."" The pound rose sharply following the news of the strong jobs figures, moving above $1.41 before falling back slightly. It also hit a six-week high against the euro. Mid-morning the pound was worth â¬1.1431.

"Hundreds of court cases axed over failingsAbout 900 cases were dropped last year due to police or the CPS failing to disclose evidence, figures show.","This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The number of prosecutions in England and Wales that collapsed because of a failure by police or prosecutors to disclose evidence increased by 70% in the last two years, the BBC can reveal. Last year, 916 people had charges dropped over a failure to disclose evidence - up from 537 in 2014-15. It comes after recent collapsed rape cases highlighted a failure to share evidence with defence solicitors. The Crown Prosecution Service said the justice system had ""systemic"" problems. In the lead up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence that might either assist the defence case or undermine the prosecution's. However, the recent collapse of several rape cases has heightened concerns that evidence is not being disclosed early enough, and that the rules are not being followed. CPS chief insists justice system is working Collapsed rape trials could hamper convictions, says Lord Judge WATCH: Why disclosure failings can prove crucial In December, the trial of Liam Allan, who faced 12 counts of rape and sexual assault, was halted. The case against Mr Allan was dropped when it emerged evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed messages from the alleged victim pestering him for ""casual sex"". Liam Allan's case was dropped after evidence emerged on a computer disc - which police had looked through Last week, a rape charge against Oxford University student Oliver Mearswas dropped on the eve of his trial,after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. Surrey Police admitted its investigation had been flawed and launched an internal review. Surrey's Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""For too long disclosure has been seen by many officers as something that is subsequent to an investigation, ie. an administrative process at the end, rather than something that should be integral."" He acknowledged it was ""no small task"" to train the police force to think differently, but an improvement plan would be published shortly. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Suddenly, disclosure is a hot topic. It used to be seen as a rather dry part of the trial process which no one quite understood. Occasionally, there would be a headline about a miscarriage of justice because evidence was not disclosed; a review would be set up with a promise that ""lessons will be learned"", before the issue disappeared again. But the recent spate of collapsed rape prosecutions has highlighted that disclosure is not some theoretical concept but a vital legal procedure that affects people's lives. The CPS figures demonstrate that these are not isolated cases and although the number of disclosure-related failed prosecutions is comparatively small, it is increasing. There have been three official reports into disclosure in seven years (Lord Justice Gross, Richard Horwell, CPS inspectorate) but only now, it seems, is there a determination among police and prosecutors to grip the issue. Jerry Hayes, the prosecuting barrister in Liam Allan's case, fears innocent people were ""probably"" being jailed because of disclosure failings. ""And it may have been some time ago and it may well be that evidence is destroyed. Their lives are now destroyed,"" he told the Today programme. Julia Smart, defence counsel for Liam Allan, said she was not surprised by the BBC's figures, saying she and her colleagues believed ""objective investigation"" was not happening. She said it was partly down to resources but police also needed to consider all possible lines of inquiry, not just focus on building up a case, and the prosecution should not be holding onto evidence. This video can not be played Samuel Armstrong said his life had been ""turned upside down"" by allegations Samuel Armstrong, an aide to Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, was cleared by a jury of raping a woman after evidence was handed over just before his trial. He said he and the woman had been drinking and dancing to jazz music before having consensual sex in the MP's Westminster office. The court heard the woman had given the story to journalists 15 hours after the pair had sex. Mr Armstrong told BBC 5 live his message to director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders was: ""You say that there is a problem and that you recognise it. You describe it as irritating and disappointing. ""For the young people involved it's much more - it's devastating,"" he said. ""If you think there's a problem, if you recognise that this is an issue, why don't you apologise to me, to Liam Allan and to all of the other young victims."" The new figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal the total number of people whose trials have ended or the charges against them dropped due to a failure to disclose evidence. Over a four-year period, the number of completed prosecutions fell by almost 150,000 cases - from more than 736,000 in 2013-14 to just over 588,000 in 2016-17. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, blamed issues on a ""lack of investment, training and attention to the criminal justice system"". She said barristers face ""a daily struggle in respect of disclosure, delays and all the other disastrous consequences of a system that is openly described by MPs as at breaking point"". ""The reasons for it must be properly explored and dealt with,"" she added. She said Richard Foster, chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission,had written,externalto the director of public prosecutions and the attorney general 18 months ago about the problem. A CPS spokesperson said the number of dropped cases due to evidence disclosure failures represented just 0.15% of the total number of prosecutions. ""That is still too many, however, and we are clear that there are systemic disclosure issues across the criminal justice system which will require a collective effort in order to bring about improvement.

Britons facing Turkish-led forces in Syria,"This video can not be played In the video released by the YPG a man with an American accent is heard saying they are prepared to fight British men are among a group of international volunteers preparing to fight against Turkish-led forces in north-west Syria, the BBC understands. They have joined the Kurdish militia, the YPG, to fight the Turkish offensive on the Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin. Among the volunteers is a 24-year-old British-Chinese fighter from Manchester, known as Huang Lei. Lei, who originally travelled to Syria in 2015 to battle against IS, told the BBC it was his ""duty"" to fight. The YPG has released a video showing an international group of volunteers who previously fought in Syria against so-called Islamic State. Lei has told the BBC that there are two other Britons with him among the group, although they have chosen to remain anonymous. Thousands flee Turkish assault on Afrin How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Who are the Kurds? In the video, an American says: ""We're all ready to go and fight in Afrin, against the invading force of Turkey. ""We've been training for a significant amount of time. We are prepared, and we have been supplied by the YPG to fight against the Turkish terrorists."" Huang Lei was a student studying international politics at the University of Manchester when he travelled to Syria in 2015 ""We were fighting against ISIS in Syria and suddenly we heard that Turkey is attacking Afrin and bombing the city,"" he says. ""We want to go there to help people defend the city and protect the people."" Huang Lei, pictured with another fighter, says there is now a group of around 20 international volunteers preparing to fight against Turkish-led forces This marks a significant shift in the involvement of international fighters in the Syrian war. With the IS threat diminished, for some volunteers their mission has changed. YPG fighters have been seen to the north-east of Afrin ""Defending Afrin is our duty,"" says Lei, who was a student studying international politics at the University of Manchester when he travelled to Syria in 2015. Turkey views the YPG as terrorists and has launched a new offensive to drive Kurdish fighters out of Afrin. Lei says there is now a group of around 20 international volunteers who will go to defend the city, including Britons from Manchester, London and Leeds, and others from France, Germany, Spain and the US. He says: ""For me personally, the kindness and comradeship the Kurdish people have shown is my motivation to stand against Turkey"". Turkish-led forces launched an offensive to drive a Kurdish Militia out of the Afrin region on Saturday The British Foreign Office has repeatedly warned people not to get involved in fighting abroad, so signs of changing motivations from western anti-IS fighters may prompt fresh concern. Michael Stephens, a Middle East analyst from the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""Previously their actions had aligned completely with the goals of coalition partners. ""Now these volunteers are taking on a sovereign country and a NATO ally and this brings up certain legal considerations."" Lei accepts he may face consequences if he comes back to Britain. ""I really hope I can return, but I don't want to come back and get arrested,"" he says. ""I am here to fight against terrorists. I don't want to come back home and become a terrorist."" Lei has survived battles against IS, but a fight against the Turkish military may place him in even greater danger. The Turkish army have been shelling Afrin, killing civilians as well as YPG fighters. Does he fears this prospect? ""Of course I am afraid of death,"" he says. ""But, on a basic level, so is every human fighting in the YPG.""

Save the Children attacked in Afghanistan,"This video can not be played The attack sends a huge plume of black smoke into the sky Attackers have detonated explosives before storming the offices of the Save the Children charity in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. At least two people have been killed and 12 injured, officials say. It is believed about 50 staff were in the building at the time. The Islamic State group has said three of its fighters are behind the attack, which is said to have now ended. Save the Children has temporarily suspended all of its Afghan programmes. The attack started at about 09:10 local time (04:40 GMT) on Wednesday when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle explosive at the entrance to the Save the Children compound, Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, told the BBC. An eyewitness who was inside the compound at the time told AFP news agency that he saw a gunman hitting the main gate with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). A suicide attacker detonated a car bomb at the entrance to the Save the Children compound Security forces dashed to seal off the area Afghan commandos joined police to try to end the attack.

About 45 people were reported to have been rescued from the basement, as fighting continued on the upper floors. Earlier, one WhatsApp message, reported by AFP to be from an employee, had read: ""I can hear two attackers... They are looking for us. Pray for us... Inform the security forces."" There are several other aid agencies in the area, along with government offices. The Islamic State group said in a message on its news outlet Amaq that three attackers and an explosives-laden car had targeted ""British, Swedish and Afghan institutions in Jalalabad"".

Deaf mum sues Little Mix concert promoter,"This video can not be played How one mother's frustration turned into an unprecedented legal action Eight-year-old Cate Merry and her friend Megan are big fans of Little Mix. They've got the T-shirts, the photo albums, the CDs, can sing the songs and rock the dance routines. So how did their love of the band lead to unprecedented legal action? Sally and her friends wanted to share the full experience of the concert with their daughters Last year, Cate's mum Sally Reynolds bought six tickets to see the band in concert on 1 September at the South of England Event Centre in Sussex. Sally is deaf and booked for herself and two deaf friends to go with their daughters who are all able to hear. In order that she and her two friends could fully access the performance, Sally asked the organisers, LHG Live, to provide a British Sign Language interpreter. She was initially offered carer tickets and told that she could bring her own interpreter, but she didn't consider that met her needs or amounted to full access. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sally explained: ""We asked two or three times, please can you provide the interpreter for us, and the explanation we got back was just a 'no'. ""It didn't have any reason behind it and eventually we became so frustrated. ""I wanted to share the same experience my daughter had - essentially I just wanted access to the songs."" Under the Equality Act 2010, any organisation supplying a service to the public is under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that a disabled person's experience is as close as possible to that of someone without a disability. With just days to go before the concert, and no interpreter in place, Sally took an unprecedented legal step. She decided to instruct lawyers to apply for a court injunction to force LHG Live to provide a British Sign Language interpreter. It worked. Hours before the hearing was due to take place, LHG Live agreed. The promoters provided a signer for Little Mix The girls and their mums got to go to the concert and when Little Mix took to the stage their lyrics were interpreted for Sally and her friends by a specialist interpreter from the company Performance Interpreting. However, the concert had started with two supporting acts and the interpreter had not been booked to cover them. ""I felt that we were really part of the Little Mix experience,"" said Sally, ""but because it was so good I realised that we had missed out on the first two acts. ""So it was very much a disparity of experience compared with everyone else. ""We only got access to the last act.  If you went to a film can you imagine only getting access to the last 20 minutes? ""We had paid for our tickets like everyone else."" The girls felt part of the Little Mix experience In a statement, LHG Live told the BBC: ""We received a request from Sally Reynolds to supply an interpreter. ""We consulted with her recommended agency and agreed to provide the professional interpreter of her choice for the Little Mix show. ""This included specific staging and lighting, and a set list in advance."" This video can not be played BBC journalist Jayde Pearson on what it's like to sign at a concert LHG Live also provided upgraded tickets, access to private accessible toilets and all public announcements on giant screens either side of the main stage. Sally Reynolds is now issuing legal proceedings for the failure to make reasonable adjustments, in the form of supplying an interpreter, for the whole concert. Her solicitor Chris Fry, managing partner of Fry Law, believes the action shines a light on a wider point. ""People with sensory impairment actually want to attend musical and sporting events just as anybody else does,"" he says. ""The fact that you have a hearing impairment or sight loss doesn't mean that you don't want to be at the event. ""So it is important that venues and promoters recognise that the legal duties to make reasonable adjustments extend to them. ""It is an important way of making society more inclusive."" For Cate though, it's all much simpler. ""Sometimes my mum doesn't get to have the experience to go to places because sometimes there aren't interpreters,"" she says. ""I really love my mum, and I want her to come to the concerts with me."" A spokesman for the band said: ""Little Mix strongly believe their concerts should be completely inclusive for all. ""The band welcome all fans to their shows, including those with hearing impairment, and encourage the promoters they work with to make provisions to ensure their fans can enjoy the concert experience.""

England and US will not take tolerance test,"The first tests measuring cultural awareness and being able to spot fake news will be taken this year Schools in England and the United States will not be taking the new international Pisa test designed to assess respect for other cultures, challenge extremism and help identify fake news. The new ""global competences"" test will be carried out alongside maths, reading and science, as part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s influential Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. But some Western countries including England, the United States, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Ireland have decided not to take the global competence test, although they will take the other core academic subject tests. Schools in Scotland, Australia and Canada are among those that will take the global competence test, which is being launched this year. The OECD's Pisa rankings have become important international benchmarks for education systems. But the economic think tank has decided to introduce a very different kind of test, addressing the type of skills young people need to navigate a world of ""post-truth"" and social media ""echo chambers"". The Pisa tests are going to compare countries on how well young people can work together The concept of global competence was intended to test how well young people were prepared to work alongside people from different cultures and with different beliefs. The test will measure tolerance, cultural awareness and how well teenagers can distinguish between reliable sources of information and fake news. It will consider issues such as racism, cultural identity and prejudice. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said the success of education systems had to be measured on more than exam results. Speaking in London at the Education World Forum, he said there had to be a greater awareness of ""values"". Andreas Schleicher says social media can encourage people to stay within their ""echo chambers"" Alongside globalisation and the rise of social media, he said, there had been a ""polarisation"" in beliefs, which meant that some teenagers could be left with little awareness of the views of other people. The test is underpinned by the idea that young people should understand other cultures, show respect for ""human dignity"" and be able to objectively analyse information. The OECD has been trailing these plans for a new kind of Pisa test for the past year. But Mr Schleicher said the ""crunch"" point was that some countries were reluctant to be compared on these measures. And there had been a ""hesitation"" about moving from discussing students' beliefs to ""hard data"" from testing them. ""I take a different view. The only way to get serious, the only way to get started with this issue is to look at the truth,"" said the OECD's education chief. Mr Schleicher said that the test would reveal the countries that paid only ""lip service"" to the ideas of tolerance and inclusion. ""What do students actually think? What do students actually know? ""That's the aim of Pisa, to confront us with the real world, not the world of words and beautiful theory,"" he said. The most successful education systems were often the most open and diverse, Mr Schleicher said, giving Canada as an example. The Department for Education in England said Pisa was valued for the information it provided on schools - and that schools would continue to take the other Pisa tests, with the results and rankings to be published next year. But it said that ""like more than half of the 80 countries"" taking Pisa tests, it would not place an ""additional burden"" on schools with the new global competence test. ""All schools are already required to teach pupils to have a mutual respect and tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs,"" said a DFE spokeswoman. But the Scottish government said it wanted to carry out a test which would help young people to ""thrive in today's world"". ""The results will help us understand how we can further support young people to be responsible global citizens, capable of taking part in local, regional and global decision making and debate,"" said the Scottish government spokeswoman. The OECD says that there are still likely to be changes to the countries participating, but at present there will be 28 countries in the inaugural rankings on global competences - and a further 24 countries will gather data, without students taking the test.

Addiction to prescription drugs probed,"Public Health England is launching a review into the ""growing problem"" of prescription drug addiction. NHS data,externalsuggest one in every 11 patients in England is being prescribed medication that could be addictive, or difficult to come off. This includes sedatives, painkillers and antidepressants. PHE wants to avoid a situation like the one in the US, where there's been amassive increase in addiction to opioids. The hell of my prescription drug withdrawal The prescription drug flooding the UK Why opioids are such an American problem The review, which will take a year, will cover: sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines and z-drugs (zolpidem and zopiclone) painkillers called opioids, pregabalin and gabapentin (the latter two are also used to treat epilepsy) antidepressants While antidepressants are not addictive, some patients experience difficulties when they try to stop taking them. Prescribing of ""addictive medicines"" - sedatives and painkillers - has increased 3% over five years,GP data for England suggests,external. Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""We know this is a huge problem in other countries like the United States - and we must absolutely make sure it doesn't become one here. ""While we are world-leading in offering free treatment for addiction, we cannot be complacent."" Director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco at PHE, Rosanna O'Connor, said: ""It is of real concern that so many people find themselves dependent on or suffering withdrawal symptoms from prescribed medicines. Many will have sought help for a health problem only to find later on they have a further obstacle to overcome."" Experts say many prescriptions will be appropriate and people should not come off their medication without speaking to their doctor. Judy (not her real name), who is 43 and from Shropshire, was prescribed diazepam at the age of 30 to treat anxiety. She still takes it now. ""My whole life has been torn apart. It's an absolute medical disaster. ""My aim is to get off it, of course, but with each tiny drop in dose, the symptoms hit - and so hard - it's horrific."" Claire (not her real name), 43 and from West Yorkshire, has been taking antidepressants for most of her adult life.  She was prescribed them at the age of 22 when she was experiencing a particularly difficult, stressful time. Two decades on, she is still on the medication, although she wants to stop. ""Once you are on it, it's like a roundabout and nobody wants to help you get off. There's been very little support. I've been tempted to go cold turkey, which is not the best thing to do. ""You take the drugs and you feel a bit better and you don't have the motivation to change things. There's safety in the familiar. ""With different support in the beginning I might not be this medicated person."" The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, is calling for more support, including a helpline for patients who develop drug dependency. A spokesman said: ""Doctors see first-hand the need for greater action and support to tackle this problem."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""GPs will always prescribe in the best interests of the individual patient in front of us, taking into account the physical, psychological and social factors that might be impacting their health. We will only prescribe medication after a frank conversation with the patient about the potential risks and benefits, and we will also conduct regular medication reviews in partnership with patients. ""However, we know most patients would rather not be on long-term medication and where appropriate we will explore non-pharmacological treatments, but these - and this is particularly so for psychological therapies - are often scarce at community level. ""We hope that conclusions from this review will include highlighting the need for greater provision of and access to alternative treatments in the community - and for those patients who do become addicted to prescription medications to have easy, consistent, but also confidential access to appropriate, high-quality support."" The Royal College of Psychiatrists said antidepressants were potentially lifesaving for some people and patients should not be put off taking them in light of this review.

The Presidents Club said it would investigate, while the Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was also looking into the claims. Great Ormond Street Hospital and Evelina London Children's Hospital have said they will return previous donations from the organisers following the allegations. The only women at last Thursday's event, attended by senior figures in business and finance, were hired hostesses. Madison Marriage, the Financial Times reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the event. She said the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels and also that they could drink alcohol while working. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ They were asked to sign a five-page non-disclosure agreement about the event upon arrival at the hotel, Ms Marriage said, and were not warned they might be sexually harassed. She told BBC Newsnightshe was groped ""several times"" and said: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly. ""This isn't, I suppose, a high-level groping, but one of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he'd suddenly start holding your hand."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". ""I had one woman tell me that she was shocked,"" she said. ""She was asked if she was a prostitute on the night."" Over more than 30 years, the annual dinner has raised Â£20m for children's charities, including Great Ormond Street Hospital and Evelina London Children's Hospital. Great Ormond Street said it was ""shocked"" and a spokeswoman for Evelina London Children's Hospital said it was ""alarmed"" by the allegations. The hospitals have said they will return previous donations from the organisers of the dinner following the reports. The Charity Commission said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". Former Department for Education non-executive board member David Meller, new education minister Nadhim Zahawi and retail tycoon Sir Philip Green were among the men who attended. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, education minister Anne Milton told MPs that Mr Meller had quit his role following the allegations. She said Mr Meller, founder of the Meller Educational Trust, was ""absolutely clear"" that stepping down was the ""right thing to do"". This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' Ms Milton said allegations of this type of behaviour were ""completely unacceptable"" and that board members were required to follow a code of conduct. ""It is quite extraordinary to me that, in the 21st Century, allegations of this kind are still emerging,"" she said. ""Women have the right to feel safe wherever they work."" Education minister Anne Milton said David Meller was ""absolutely clear"" that stepping down was the ""right thing to do"" Mr Meller has also resigned as a trustee of the Mayor's Fund for London. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Zahawi had ""attended briefly and felt uncomfortable at what had begun to happen."" Mr Zahawi told Newsnight: ""I didn't stay long enough to really comment on the occasion."" Mr Zahawi later tweeted,external: ""I do unequivocally condemn this behaviour. The report is truly shocking. I will never attend a men only function ever."" But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions, while shadow eduction secretary Angela Rayner called for an investigation into his attendance. The Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. The Department for Education said Mr Meller and Mr Zahawi had both attended in a personal capacity. In a statement, the Presidents Club said: ""The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. ""The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken."" A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality and women's rights, said: ""Sexual harassment, but all in a good cause? This is completely outrageous and proves why we need sexual harassment by clients or customers to be covered by law. ""At the moment, these women are unable to hold their employer to account for putting them in that situation."" WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, which had sponsored a table at the dinner, said it was withdrawing its future support. Boss Sir Martin Sorrell, who did not attend, told BBC Radio 4's Todayhis guests did not see such behaviour and said: ""We won't support the charity in future, which is regrettable because it is a charity that supports numerous children's charities and has done a lot of good work."" Real estate investment business Frogmore said the guests at its table were ""unaware of any of the described events but in no way condone this behaviour"" and it will now end its association with the event. Part of the event included a charity auction, with one of the prizes being the chance to have tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. However, a Bank of England spokesman said it was not aware of the dinner and ""did not approve any prize"". He said it was understood a prize donated by the Bank to the Lord Mayor's Appeal charity auction had been re-gifted by the winner to the Presidents Club event. ""The unauthorised re-auctioning of the prize at the Presidents Club dinner was clearly against the spirit of the original donation,"" he said. ""The Bank has therefore made clear that it has been withdrawn."" Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: ""If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment."" Downing Street said the prime minister was ""uncomfortable"" at the reports about the dinner and a spokesman added that it was ""an event she wouldn't be invited to"". Another auction prize included lunch with Boris Johnson, but Ms Milton said the foreign secretary knew nothing of his inclusion and in no way endorsed the event. Maria Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities select committee, told the BBC the report gave ""cause for concern"" and brought into question whether laws in the area were strong enough. Jess Phillips MP, who chairs the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party, told the BBC it was ""totally unacceptable that women should be hired in as a herd to entertain a group of entitled rich men"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""This is brave reporting from the FT, exposing behaviour that is outrageous and unacceptable."" Allow Twitter content?

Rape trial student to sue police,"Liam Allan said he was ""disappointed"" he had not yet received an apology from the Met Police A man wrongly accused of rape says he will sue the Metropolitan Police over its failure to disclose vital evidence that led to the collapse of the trial. Liam Allan was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records. The 22-year-old student said he was ""disappointed"" he had not yet received an apology. The Met Police said it was ""urgently reviewing the investigation"". The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim pestered him for ""casual sex"". Talking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Allan said: ""University is meant to be the best years of your life and the last two years have been spent worrying and not concentrating on anything. ""It has completely ripped apart my normal personal life."" The 22-year-old student had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault He added he had not yet received any contact or an apology from the Met and found that ""disappointing"". ""I feel relief on one side, that the case is over, but now there's the stress of getting compensation and the process of suing - so it's not over completely"", he said. Mr Allan faced a possible jail term of 12 years and being put on the sex offenders register for life had he been found guilty. He said he felt ""pure fear"" when he learned he had been accused of rape but would never be able to understand why the accusations were made. It is understood police had looked at thousands of phone messages when reviewing evidence in the case, but had failed to disclose to the prosecution and defence teams messages between the complainant and her friends which cast doubt on the allegations against Mr Allan. A Met spokesman said the force was ""urgently reviewing this investigation and will be working with the Crown Prosecution Service to understand exactly what has happened in this case. ""The Met understands the concerns that have been raised as a result of this case being dismissed from court and the ongoing review will seek to address those,"" he said. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""In November 2017, the police provided more material in the case of Liam Allan. Upon a review of that material, it was decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. ""We will now be conducting a management review together with the Metropolitan Police to examine the way in which this case was handled.""

"Elton John to make statement on futureThe pop star, whose Las Vegas residency ends in March, is due to announce what could be his final tour.2m3 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts","Sir Elton John is set to make an announcement about his future career at a press conference on Wednesday. The star is expected to reveal plans for a new venture after his Las Vegas residency ends in May after six years. British newspaperThe Mirror has reported,externalthe 70-year-old will announce his final world tour. His representatives would not confirm the report before the press conference, which will take place simultaneously in New York and London. Sir Elton has sold more than 300 million records over his career and is one of the world's most in-demand live performers. Last year, he wasforced to cancel nine showsin Las Vegas and California because of a bacterial infection he contracted during a South American tour. Sir Elton's management said the ""potentially deadly"" infection forced him to spend two nights in intensive care in April and to cancel concerts in the US. However he played 87 shows throughout 2017, including dates in Europe and Australia, as well as his demanding Las Vegas show, The Million Dollar Piano. He also appeared as himself in action movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle last year. The star is due to perform a duet with Miley Cyrus at Sunday's Grammy Awards. He will also host a special concert in his honour at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, with guest stars including Sam Smith, Chris Martin, Kesha, John Legend and Keith Urban. He is currently working on a Broadway musical based on The Devil Wears Prada, as well as the live action version of Disney's The Lion King and the animation Sherlock Gnomes, produced by his own production company. Visitors to Sir Elton's official website are currently being met with a countdown to Wednesday's press conference, and the words ""I've finally decided my future lies..."" - a reference to lyrics from his hit Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The announcement was preceded by a stunt at London's Kings Cross Station, where fans could sit at a grand piano and play alongside an ""augmented reality"" Sir Elton. That, combined with the fact that Wednesday's press conference takes place at YouTube's headquarters, suggests there will be a tech aspect to the star's announcement. A teaser on Sir Elton's Twitter feed featured video of his career-making shows at the Los Angeles Troubadour in 1970, with the text ""a wrinkle in time, past meets present"". Allow YouTube content?

""Elton must never stop performing,"" his husbandDavid Furnish told Music Week last year.,external ""Some people relish the idea of a retirement where they do nothing [but] for Elton that would be purgatory."" However, he added: ""I think given our commitments to our kids and our family - and now our boys are nearly seven and five and at that point where they need you present more than ever - it's important we're there to support them.

Car insurance premiums hit new high,"Car insurance premiums have once again risen to a new high, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Between October and December 2017 average premiums rose to Â£481, a rise of 9% on the previous year. That is the highest figure since the ABI started records in 2012, and the eighth successive quarter in which premiums have risen. The industry blames a series of increases in Insurance Premium Tax, and changes to the so-called discount rate. Since June last year all insurance premiums have been taxed at 12%. Government plans changes to discount rate The government has already announced plans to reverse changes to the discount rate, but these have yet to come into force. The discount - or Ogden - rate is designed to compensate insurers for the cost of long-term injury claims. It was reduced by the government last April, costing insurance firms large amounts of money. However, in September the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it would revise the scheme. New legislation may eventually ease the pressure on premiums, although some experts believe that the cost of car insurance is unlikely to fall. The MoJ has also announced a series of reforms to whiplash-related claims, in an attempt to reduce fraud. ""The rising cost of motor insurance shows no sign of abating,"" said Rob Cummings, the ABI's assistant director. ""Changes to how compensation payouts are calculated, Insurance Premium Tax, more whiplash-style claims and rising repair bills are all piling on the pressure for cash-strapped drivers."" The ABI said most insurers were currently making a loss on motor policies.

Brazil poised for Lula appeal verdict,"Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is currently the frontrunner in Brazil's 2018 presidential elections Three judges in Brazil will shortly decide whether to uphold a prison term given to the country's former President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The ruling could prove vital to Brazil's political future. Despite beingconvicted of corruption and money-laundering in July 2017, Lula is hoping to win another term as president at elections on 7 October. He firmly denies the allegations against him, which he says are designed to stop him running for office again. Not immediately. Lula, 72, has been sentenced to nine-and-a-half years' imprisonment, but if the judges don't overturn that he won't be sent straight to jail. Brazil ex-leader Lula's future on a knife edge He has remained free while the most recent appeal was heard, and could still appeal to higher courts. If the sentence is upheld it would likely put paid to his re-election ambitions, though - angering his many supporters. Thousands of Lula's supporters have been rallying in the southern city of Porto Alegre, where the appeal has been heard. Addressing the crowd on Tuesday, the Workers' Party figurehead said only death would stop him persevering. ""Only one thing will take me off the streets of this country, and it will be the day of my death,"" he declared. Crowds show their support for Lula at a rally in Porto Alegre ""Until that moment, I will fight for a more just society. Whatever the outcome of the trial, I will continue fighting for the dignity of the people of this country."" Anti-Lula demonstrators took part in a rival march in Porto Alegre, demanding an end to corruption. When left-winger Lula rose to power in 2003, he promised an end to shady, corruption-ridden politics.Then in 2005 a huge vote-buying scandal nearly cost him his job. Despite that, he won the support of the poor by pouring billions of dollars into social programmes, and left office in 2011 with record approval ratings. It was Brazil's biggest-ever corruption scandal, Operation Car Wash, which triggered Lula's current legal woes. A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Profile: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva The investigation, which began in March 2014, sucked in more than 80 politicians and members of the business elite. In 2017 Lula was found guilty of accepting a beachfront apartment from an engineering firm in return for help in winning contracts for Petrobras - Brazil's state oil company. He also faces other charges of money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice. He has repeatedly denied those claims. Lula, a former steel worker turned union boss, came to office as Brazil's first left-wing leader in almost half a century. He remains one of the best-loved politicians in Brazilian history. But critics insist he is a hypocrite - and a symbol of endemic political corruption. If he does get to run in October, opinion polls give him a good chance - his support is currently twice that of his nearest rival. A crowd of anti-Lula demonstrators in Sao Paulo Whatever the judges in Regional Federal Tribunal 4 decide, it could well trigger protests from pro- or anti-Lula factions in the days to come. A security operation is under way in Porto Alegre to prevent clashes between the two sides. Helicopters will fly over the court building, while ships are being deployed to protect it on a nearby river. Lula will not be present in court, and is expected to follow the outcome from his home in Sao Paulo.

Ikea boss says it pays fair share of tax,"Ikea Group boss Jesper Brodin has told the BBC that the company pays its fair share of tax worldwide. The flatpack furniture retailer, which has more than 360 stores, paid 25% tax last year, Mr Brodin said. EU tax officials opened an investigation last month into a separate part of Ikea. Inter Ikea, which controls the company's brand rights, may have been given unfair tax advantages by the Netherlands, the commission said. Mr Brodin acknowledged the launch of the EU investigation, but said it was focused on a separate part of the business. Inter Ikea, which collects royalty payments from Ikea stores, said last month that it believed that the way it had been taxed ""has in our view been in accordance with EU rules"". Jesper Brodin (r) took over from Peter Agnefjall (l) last year Mr Brodin, whotook the helm of the Swedish furniture giantlast September, said Ikea Group was ""a stable payer of tax"". He noted that Ikea's continuing profitability even in the ""tough years"" after the 2008 financial crisis meant it had consistently continued to pay tax. ""We think it's important to contribute to society in many ways and paying tax is one part of it. We believe we do,"" he added. Mr Brodin is at the World Economic Forum in Davos to talk about the so called circular economy where products are used for as long as possible before being broken down and used to make something else. Ikea has pledged that by 2020, 90% of its waste will be recycled or incinerated for energy recovery. Mr Brodin, who was previously head of Ikea's supply chain and product range business, said the aim was not at odds with its role as a retailer creating and selling more products. More from Davos on the BBC ""All products will sooner or later reach the end of their life,"" he said. He said the group's growing scale - it now has 362 stores globally - meant it could make an impact on the issue. The company is currently trialling different solutions in different countries. In Japan, for example, customers can sell their furniture back to Ikea to be resold. Whereas in Belgium customers can get their furniture repaired or donated to charity. ""Our markets are at different levels of maturity. It might not be one size fits all,"" he added. EU to investigate Ikea's tax affairs Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers?

Head warns pupils against teen romances,"Ruthin School is an independent school where pupils can board The head teacher of a top public school has warned pupils that being in a teenage relationship could hamper their chances of going to university. Toby Belfield, principal of Ruthin School in Denbighshire, wrote an email to all students to try to deter them. He said in his experience pupils in relationships at school were ""at danger of academically underachieving"". He added while he would not expel them, he would give them the opportunity to ""review their romantic situation"". ""Parents choose Ruthin School because it is a top ranking academic institution,"" he explained. ""In my experience, students who are in a relationship, whilst at school, are at danger of academically underachieving. Head sparks row over Welsh language Head's apology over Welsh language row ""Therefore, if they devote their time to their studies, rather than the emotional turmoil connected with teenage romance, they will achieve higher grades and go to better universities. ""This is the primary objective of the school - to enable them to fulfil their academic potential and go to the best universities in the world. "" Toby Belfield said he wanted to dissuade teenage relationships Mr Belfield told BBC Wales he would not hamper a student's chances of a university place by writing a less favourable reference if they had a boyfriend or girlfriend, but added: ""My email was a generic one to all students, to try to dissuade them from being in a teenage relationship"". Mr Belfield said pupils with a boyfriend or girlfriend would ""be given the opportunity to review their current romantic situation, and my belief is that they (and their parents) will put their education first"".

Hundreds of cases dropped after failings,"This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The number of prosecutions in England and Wales that collapsed because of a failure by police or prosecutors to disclose evidence increased by 70% in the last two years, the BBC can reveal. Last year, 916 people had charges dropped over a failure to disclose evidence - up from 537 in 2014-15. It comes after recent collapsed rape cases highlighted a failure to share evidence with defence solicitors. The Crown Prosecution Service said the justice system had ""systemic"" problems. In the lead up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence that might either assist the defence case or undermine the prosecution's. However, the recent collapse of several rape cases has heightened concerns that evidence is not being disclosed early enough, and that the rules are not being followed. CPS chief insists justice system is working Collapsed rape trials could hamper convictions, says Lord Judge WATCH: Why disclosure failings can prove crucial In December, the trial of Liam Allan, who faced 12 counts of rape and sexual assault, was halted. The case against Mr Allan was dropped when it emerged evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed messages from the alleged victim pestering him for ""casual sex"". Liam Allan's case was dropped after evidence emerged on a computer disc - which police had looked through Last week, a rape charge against Oxford University student Oliver Mearswas dropped on the eve of his trial,after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. Surrey Police admitted its investigation had been flawed and launched an internal review. Surrey's Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""For too long disclosure has been seen by many officers as something that is subsequent to an investigation, ie. an administrative process at the end, rather than something that should be integral."" He acknowledged it was ""no small task"" to train the police force to think differently, but an improvement plan would be published shortly. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Suddenly, disclosure is a hot topic. It used to be seen as a rather dry part of the trial process which no one quite understood. Occasionally, there would be a headline about a miscarriage of justice because evidence was not disclosed; a review would be set up with a promise that ""lessons will be learned"", before the issue disappeared again. But the recent spate of collapsed rape prosecutions has highlighted that disclosure is not some theoretical concept but a vital legal procedure that affects people's lives. The CPS figures demonstrate that these are not isolated cases and although the number of disclosure-related failed prosecutions is comparatively small, it is increasing. There have been three official reports into disclosure in seven years (Lord Justice Gross, Richard Horwell, CPS inspectorate) but only now, it seems, is there a determination among police and prosecutors to grip the issue. Jerry Hayes, the prosecuting barrister in Liam Allan's case, fears innocent people were ""probably"" being jailed because of disclosure failings. ""And it may have been some time ago and it may well be that evidence is destroyed. Their lives are now destroyed,"" he told the Today programme. Julia Smart, defence counsel for Liam Allan, said she was not surprised by the BBC's figures, saying she and her colleagues believed ""objective investigation"" was not happening. She said it was partly down to resources but police also needed to consider all possible lines of inquiry, not just focus on building up a case, and the prosecution should not be holding onto evidence. This video can not be played Samuel Armstrong said his life had been ""turned upside down"" by allegations Samuel Armstrong, an aide to Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, was cleared by a jury of raping a woman after evidence was handed over just before his trial. He said he and the woman had been drinking and dancing to jazz music before having consensual sex in the MP's Westminster office. The court heard the woman had given the story to journalists 15 hours after the pair had sex. Mr Armstrong told BBC 5 live his message to director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders was: ""You say that there is a problem and that you recognise it. You describe it as irritating and disappointing. ""For the young people involved it's much more - it's devastating,"" he said. ""If you think there's a problem, if you recognise that this is an issue, why don't you apologise to me, to Liam Allan and to all of the other young victims."" The new figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal the total number of people whose trials have ended or the charges against them dropped due to a failure to disclose evidence. Over a four-year period, the number of completed prosecutions fell by almost 150,000 cases - from more than 736,000 in 2013-14 to just over 588,000 in 2016-17. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, blamed issues on a ""lack of investment, training and attention to the criminal justice system"". She said barristers face ""a daily struggle in respect of disclosure, delays and all the other disastrous consequences of a system that is openly described by MPs as at breaking point"". ""The reasons for it must be properly explored and dealt with,"" she added. She said Richard Foster, chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission,had written,externalto the director of public prosecutions and the attorney general 18 months ago about the problem. A CPS spokesperson said the number of dropped cases due to evidence disclosure failures represented just 0.15% of the total number of prosecutions. ""That is still too many, however, and we are clear that there are systemic disclosure issues across the criminal justice system which will require a collective effort in order to bring about improvement. ""Getting this right is a priority, and along with the police and other criminal justice partners we are working to improve how we fulfil these vital disclosure obligations.""

The Shape of Water leads Oscar nominations,"This video can not be played Find out the key Oscar nominees for 2018 The nominations for the 90th Academy Awards have been announced, with The Shape of Water leading the field. Guillermo del Toro's fantasy romance received 13 nominations, including best picture. World War Two drama Dunkirk follows with eight nominations, while Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri received seven. British stars shortlisted include Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins and a pair of Daniels - Day-Lewis and Kaluuya. What's up for best picture this year? How did #MeToo shape the Oscar nominations? 8 talking points from the nominations The Oscar nominations in full Greta Gerwig has landed a best director nomination for Lady Bird, one of nine films shortlisted for the best picture award. Woody Harrelson and Frances McDormand are both nominated in Three Billboards Others include Steven Spielberg's The Post, gay romance Call Me By Your Name and Winston Churchill drama Darkest Hour. Oldman's performance as Churchill has already won the British actor a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award. To win the Oscar, though, he will have to beat three-time best actor winner Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, nominated again for Phantom Thread. Gary Oldman among best actor nominees Another best actress nomination for Streep Meryl Streep's best actress nomination for newspaper drama The Post is her 17th for best actress and her 21st overall. The three-time Oscar winner said she was ""honoured beyond measure"" to be recognised for ""a film that stands in defence of press freedom and inclusion of women's voices in the movement of history"". Lady Bird's nominations included best director and best picture Frances McDormand is tipped to be this year's winner for her role as a grieving mother in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Two of McDormand's co-stars, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, go head to head in the best supporting actor category. The Shape of Water has also fared well in the acting categories, with nominations for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer alongside Hawkins' best actress nod. Del Toro's film narrowly missed out on tying with the previous nomination record of 14, obtained by the films All About Eve, Titanic and La La Land. Diversity continues to be a hot topic in Hollywood, which has been rocked this year by sexual harassment scandals, concerns over gender pay equality and the role of women both in front of and behind the camera. These topics appear to have had an impact on this year's nominations, which are largely free of embarrassing exclusions and the kind of all-white line-ups that led to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign on social media. Greta Gerwig's nomination in the best director category will placate those who expressed displeasure at the Golden Globes' all-male directing nominees, even if she is only the fifth woman in history to be afforded that honour. And while there are no non-white performers up for best actress or best supporting actor, there are two black males up for best actor - Denzel Washington and Britain's Daniel Kaluuya - and another two shortlisted for best supporting actress. Jordan Peele's best director nomination for Get Out is also significant, given he is only the fifth black film-maker to be considered for the award. ""Right now I'm just thinking about everyone who bought a ticket and told someone else to,""Peele tweeted,externalin response to his film's four nominations. ""You did this."" Christopher Plummer has been nominated for playing J Paul Getty in All the Money in the World Eight of this year's female acting contenders are aged over 40, while Christopher Plummer becomes the oldest man to be nominated for best supporting actor for All the Money in the World. Plummer, 88, took over the role of J Paul Getty in Sir Ridley Scott's filmafter the director decided to eraseKevin Spacey's performance as the US billionaire. At 89, meanwhile, Belgian director Agnes Varda - whose film Faces Places is up for best documentary feature - is believed to be the oldest Oscar nominee ever. Varda is a week older than fellow 89-year-old James Ivory, who has been nominated for writing Call Me By Your Name's screenplay. The Academy has recently strived to broaden the ethnic, age and gender make-up of its membership, which may have filtered through to this year's nominations. Yet the Academy still has a long way to go, as a comparison between male and female nominees in some of the key categories attests. Notable firsts include Rachel Morrison's best cinematography nomination for Mudbound, Netflix's drama about racial tension in Mississippi. Morrison, whose other credits include the forthcoming Black Panther, is the first woman ever to receive a nomination in this category. Mary J Blige is up for two awards for her contributions to Mudbound Mudbound's Mary J Blige also makes history by getting nominations for best supporting actress and best song in the same year. The nine-time Grammy winner co-wrote Mighty River for the film, which is also recognised for its adapted screenplay. Mary J Blige makes Oscars history Among those to miss out this year include James Franco, who had been tipped by some to get a best actor nod for The Disaster Artist. The US actor recently became the subject ofsexual harassment allegationswhich may have hurt his chances of an Oscar nomination. London-born Martin McDonagh, Three Billboards' writer-director, is also a surprise omission from the best director line-up. Surprise nominees include Britain's Lesley Manville, up for playing Day-Lewis's sister in fashion-based period piece Phantom Thread. Paul Thomas Anderson's film, also up for best picture, best director and two other awards, did much better than many had expected. The nominations were announced in Los Angeles by British actor Andy Serkis and Girls Trip actress Tiffany Haddish. Jimmy Kimmel will return to host this year's ceremony, to be held on 4 March at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

"Car insurance premiums hit new highCar insurance premiums have risen each quarter since the end of 2015, says the insurance industry.9m10 minutes agoBusiness","Car insurance premiums have once again risen to a new high, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Between October and December 2017 average premiums rose to Â£481, a rise of 9% on the previous year. That is the highest figure since the ABI started records in 2012, and the eighth successive quarter in which premiums have risen. The industry blames a series of increases in Insurance Premium Tax, and changes to the so-called discount rate. Since June last year all insurance premiums have been taxed at 12%. Government plans changes to discount rate The government has already announced plans to reverse changes to the discount rate, but these have yet to come into force. The discount - or Ogden - rate is designed to compensate insurers for the cost of long-term injury claims. It was reduced by the government last April, costing insurance firms large amounts of money. However, in September the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it would revise the scheme. New legislation may eventually ease the pressure on premiums, although some experts believe that the cost of car insurance is unlikely to fall. The MoJ has also announced a series of reforms to whiplash-related claims, in an attempt to reduce fraud. ""The rising cost of motor insurance shows no sign of abating,"" said Rob Cummings, the ABI's assistant director. ""Changes to how compensation payouts are calculated, Insurance Premium Tax, more whiplash-style claims and rising repair bills are all piling on the pressure for cash-strapped drivers."" The ABI said most insurers were currently making a loss on motor policies.

"MPs block ex-expenses chief's new jobSir Ian Kennedy's Commons critics are called ""petty"" by one MP as they block his appointment.4h4 hours agoUK Politics","Sir Ian Kennedy had been in line to become an electoral commissioner MPs have voted to prevent the former boss of the Commons expenses watchdog from getting a new job. Sir Ian Kennedy was set to be appointed to the Electoral Commission, and no objections were raised by the leaders of the Westminster parties. But MPs voted by 77 to 46 against the appointment, with one branding him an ""arch quangocrat"" and criticising his expenses reforms. Sir Ian's critics were accused of ""petty behaviour"" by one MP. Former expenses chief's parting shot at critics Sir Ian was chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority until 2016. The organisation was set up as a response to the expenses scandal, but the subsequent system has been criticised by some MPs, who say it is difficult to work with and treats them unfairly. Labour MP John Spellar said Sir Ian had ""largely created the dreadful, anti-elected member, vindictive attitude that has permeated so much of Ipsa"". The organisation has ""taken as its premise that they are there to make life difficult for members of Parliament,"" he added, questioning the process that led to the ""arch quangocrat"" being put forward.

Conservative former minister James Duddridge suggested the 76-year-old was too old for the job, adding: ""Whilst our expenses system desperately needed to be reformed, I don't think there's a single member of the House that thinks Ipsa is a system that is a system lacking in bureaucracy that couldn't be well reformed. ""I don't think he did a good job."" But Labour's Bridget Phillipson, who served on the appointments panel, said correct procedures had been followed with a ""comprehensive and lengthy interview process"". And the SNP's Kirsty Blackman said she was ""honestly quite baffled"" at the MPs criticising the planned appointment, and ""shocked"" at Sir Ian's age being raised as a factor. ""It's pretty clear that there's a significant personal element to how some members feel about this,"" she said. When he left his role with Ipsa in 2016, Sir Ian hit back at his critics, describing his task as having been ""part constitutional reform, part mud-wrestling, part pioneer frontiersman, and part voyager through Dante's Inferno"".
