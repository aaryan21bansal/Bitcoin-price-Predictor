SNP victory 'will not be mandate for indyref2'The Scottish Secretary has denied a 2021 SNP majority would be justification for a second vote.Scotland politics,"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said a second independence referendum would not be allowed, even with a strong SNP result in 2021 The Scottish Secretary has said victory in the 2021 Scottish elections would not give the SNP a mandate to hold a second independence referendum. In a U-turn oncomments he made in November,external, Alister Jack said a majority would not legitimise another vote on leaving the union. Before the general election he implied an SNP victory could provide a mandate. SNP spokeswoman Mhairi Black said the general election had already shown there should be a new referendum. Mr Jack said he had advised Boris Johnson to not grant a section 30 order. Speaking on theBBC's Politics Scotland programme, he said: ""Nicola Sturgeon has asked for the Scottish parliament to have the right to have referendums in the future at times of its own choosing. ""That is unacceptable."" ""I have written to the prime minister on this subject this week and he will be replying very soon toNicola Sturgeon's letter of 19 December."" He added: ""It would be wrong for us to give the right to the Scottish parliament to set referendums and the context and the timings for the simple reason that Scotland would be plunged into 'neverendums'. ""Nicola Sturgeon has said she fully expects a rebuttal from the PM and my advice to him is to say that."" The MP for Dumfries and Galloway said that the SNP should have to wait until ""a generation or a lifetime has passed"". Alister Jack said his advice to Boris Johnson was to reject the requests made in her letter to the prime minister He said that what Scotland needed now was to settle down, come out of the hated common fisheries policy, to rebuild its coastal communities and to get the benefit of trade deals. He said: ""Referendums are very divisive for our society and I think the time now is for us all to pull together as one United Kingdom, and go forward and take on the benefits that exist. ""Let's see the benefits of Brexit. They (the SNP) have talked it down as being a disaster. Let's see if the world is still spinning on 1 February and how things can be good for Scotland."" Mr Jack's SNP shadow, Mhairi Black, insisted there was demand for a fresh referendum on independence. ""The SNP won a landslide victory in last month's general election,"" she said, ""winning 80% on a mandate for an independence referendum, while the Tories lost more than half their MPs. ""They stood on a platform of stopping Scotland's right to choose and were humiliated at the polls. The Tories have no mandate whatsoever to block Scottish democracy."" Ms Black added: ""I am confident that when the people of Scotland are given a choice on their future, they will choose to escape the mess of Brexit and the broken Westminster system to build a fairer Scotland."" The Scottish Secretary's comments came the day afterthousands took to the streets of Glasgowfor the first of eight pro-independence marches planned for 2020. Organisers said 80,000 people had joined the march from the city's west end to Glasgow Green in severe weather conditions. Thousands of people attended Saturday's march in very poor weather conditions The event was organised in the wake of last month's general election, which saw the pro-independence SNP win 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland while the Conservatives won a majority across the UK as a whole. Power over the constitution in the UK lies with the UK government. For an agreed second referendum to take place, a transfer of power through a section 30 order would need to be approved by Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon calls for powers to hold indyref2 Sturgeon playing the long game on indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon has warned Mr Johnson that a ""flat no"" to her request - which is expected to be his response - will not be the end of the matter, and has predicted that the prime minister will eventually have no choice but to agree to her request. She has also ruled out holding an unofficial referendum similar to the one in Catalonia two years ago, arguing that it would not lead to independence. The UK government has saidit does not support a further vote on independence.

Federer responds to climate change criticismCampaigners including Greta Thunberg want Federer to end a sponsorship deal with Credit Suisse.Europe,"The climate change activists have urged Roger Federer to 'wake up' Tennis star Roger Federer has responded to climate change critics - including campaigner Greta Thunberg - by saying he takes the issue very seriously. Activists oppose Federer's sponsorship deal with Credit Suisse over its links to the fossil fuel industry. Some appeared in court this week after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis inside Credit Suisse offices in 2018 to highlight Federer's deal. Federer did not address the deal directly in his statement. The activists - most of them students - appeared in court in Renens, Lausanne, on 7 January to appeal against the fine. Some supporters gathered outside holding banners which read: ""Credit Suisse is destroying the planet. Roger, do you support them?"" What is climate change?

Aguero hits hat-trick as Man City thrash Aston Villa,"Manchester City have scored 94 goals in 33 league and cup games this season Sergio Aguero scored his 12th hat-trick to become the highest overseas goalscorer in Premier League history in rampant Manchester City's six-goal hammering of struggling Aston Villa. The Argentine moved level - and then past - Thierry Henry, before joining Frank Lampard on 177 goals in England's top flight. Only three men - Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole - are still ahead of him on the all-time Premier League list. Aguero's number of hat-tricks is a Premier League record. It was part of a merciless City performance as they took apart a Villa side who were suffering their worst defeat since Liverpool beat them at 6-0 at Villa Park in February 2016 and have dropped into the relegation zone. Riyad Mahrez scored the first two, with Gabriel Jesus splitting Aguero's double just before half-time. The result leaves City second, the highest position they have occupied following a full round of matches since the beginning of November, although they remain 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, having played a game more. Villa's season not defined by City defeat - Smith Football Daily: Desperate times for Villa and Bournemouth This video can not be played Pep Guardiola congratulates Aguero on 'incredible achievement' It is scarcely believable now but there were some people who thought City had wasted their money when they spent Â£40m to buy Aguero from Atletico Madrid in 2011. He scored twice against Swansea on his debut and it feels like he has not stopped finding the net since. Aguero's most famous goal came at the end of that first season, against QPR to win the title, but for City fans his impact goes way beyond that single strike. The 31-year-old is the club's record scorer and now needs only one more to reach 250 for the Blues in all competitions. His first was a ferocious effort, the third a clinical strike after he had been given a clean sight of goal. But maybe the best indication of the relentlessness with which Aguero goes about his job came from the long conversation he had with Mahrez after the half-time whistle had gone, when he demanded to know why his team-mate had not set him up about five minutes earlier. City were 4-0 up at the time. Can you name the highest-scoring foreign players in the Premier League? 'Aguero is a legend and will die scoring goals' - Guardiola It was a sobering return to action for Danny Drinkwater, who joined Villa on loan from Chelsea in midweek after a similar stint with Burnley came to an end. This was Drinkwater's fourth appearance since March 2018 and remarkably meant four of the last five games he had played were against City - for three different clubs - all of which have ended in defeat. Drinkwater started quite well, with a couple of simple touches. But it wasn't long before he was showing clear signs of rustiness after being deprived of match action for such an extended period of time. Aston Villa have lost five out of 11 home league games this season Drinkwater would have known Mahrez's strengths - he shared a dressing room with him as Leicester won the title. But he was powerless to stop the Algerian stepping around him, before darting into the area to put the visitors in front. Six minutes later, Drinkwater unwisely decided to control and assess his options as the ball broke to him off Aguero deep inside his own box. David Silva afforded no time, biting into the challenge and providing Mahrez with the opportunity to crash home his second. After that it was an exercise in chasing shadows for the former England man, who needs to find his form quickly if he is to help Villa out of the problems they find themselves in. Watching from the stands, goalkeeping duo Tom Heaton and Pepe Reina were powerless to stop the first-half carnage. With Heaton on crutches as a legacy of the season-ending knee injury he suffered at Burnley on 1 January, and Reina not registered in time to feature as he is about to complete aloan movefrom AC Milan, Orjan Nyland was handed his Premier League debut. It proved to be a torrid afternoon for the 29-year-old Norwegian, who became the first goalkeeper in Premier League history to concede six goals on his first start in the competition. Nyland was beaten at his near-post for the opener and Aguero's historic effort seemed to go straight through his hands. Anwar El Ghazi scores Aston Villa's consolation from the penalty spot Reina will surely start at Brighton next Saturday, knowing Villa must improve on their record of two top flight clean sheets since 16 September. Villa now have a worse goal difference than Southampton, and they suffered that 9-0 home defeat by Leicester on 25 October. A few fans headed for the stairs with their side 3-0 down after half an hour but the majority stayed with their team to the end and cheered loudly when Anwar el Ghazi scored their injury-time consolation from the penalty stop. But, with a Financial Fair Play issue hanging over them if they return to the Championship after a single season in the top flight, it looks like being a busy couple of weeks for Villa as they try to bolster Dean Smith's squad. There were man of the match displays all over the pitch for Manchester City but this was a historic day for Sergio Aguero, who has been lighting up the Premier League for nine seasons. Aston Villa boss Dean Smith:""It's tough when you come up against world-class teams. ""There's a professional pride as a coach and a team, and the third goal summed it up - they had about 20 passes without us laying a glove on them. ""We gave them too much respect. ""Our season is not going to be defined by defeats by Man City and Liverpool. You have to learn from this. ""We have to ask why weren't we competitive and why we gave them too much respect."" This video can not be played Aston Villa 1-6 Manchester City: Dean Smith says Villa need new signings Since the start of the 2016-17 season, Manchester City have scored 343 Premier League goals - 42 more than any other team. This was Pep Guardiola's 300th top-flight league win as a manager - he has reached that tally in just 390 games with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City. City's David Silva has assisted 21 Premier League goals for team-mate Sergio Aguero - the only player to assist another more in the competition is Frank Lampard for Didier Drogba (24 goals). City's Riyad Mahrez is the only Premier League player to both score and assist 20 goals since the start of last season in all competitions (21 goals, 23 assists). In all competitions, City's Kevin de Bruyne has assisted 15 goals this season - five more than any other Premier League player. Gabriel Jesus has started 76 matches for City in all competitions - he has been directly involved in 71 goals in those matches (54 goals, 17 assists). Villa need to regroup quickly before their game at Brighton next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Manchester City host Crystal Palace at the same time.

Call to stop poor transport holding city back,"The South Wales Metro is planned to upgrade the rail network in south Wales by 2030 - but what will happen until then? South Wales is at ""a very dangerous point"" where Cardiff's growth could be held back by poor transport links, a think tank has warned. Thousands of workers are moving to developmentssuch as Central Square. But with the South Wales Metro still years away from becoming a reality, theCentre for Cities,externalsaid other short-term transport solutions are needed. It has called for a congestion charge in Cardiff, with money ploughed into better and cheaper bus services. Transport for Wales (TfW) said there would be a ""transformation"" of train services from 2022-2023, but before then it is investing Â£40m in its current fleet. ""Cardiff is at a very dangerous point,"" said the think tank's Simon Jeffrey. ""Where its success attracts more and more people but congestion starts to clog up the network and the benefits start to be outweighed by the costs."" The Metro promises a faster, more integrated network of trains, buses and light rail services Mr Jeffrey described ""real pressure"" on train services as people head to the city on weekdays - which could result in investment being lost and people turning down jobs. He believes a short-term solution can be found relatively quickly - using buses. Transport for Wales 'breaks Welsh language rules' New timetable blamed for train cancellations ""Poor transport puts people in cars, which slows buses down, pushing their cost up, making them less reliable and people move away from using them,"" he added. ""The quickest way to deal with it while improving air quality and reducing the environmental impact is through a congestion charge. ""This (money) could be pumped into buses, creating Â£1 fares."" Mr Jeffrey also suggested a workplace parking levy where employers pay for each space they have. Cardiff council will publish a paper on its 10-year transport vision next week - which could includea congestion charge to cut pollutionin the city centre. Network Rail said passenger numbers will continue rising by 5% to 6% annually over the next decade. But the pace of Cardiff's growth means it needs to keep updating its forecasts The Welsh Government's arms length body TfW took over the running of trainsfrom the much-maligned Arriva Trains Walesin October 2018. But it has been hit bythe same complaintsabout cancelled services, packed trains and how the network operates. Long-term Wales will have ""the ideal situation"" with new trains and efficient services - one other parts of the UK will be envious of, Mr Jeffrey believes. However, he warned there could be short-term pain, adding: ""It would be a tragedy if three or four years are lost between now and when the Metro is up and running."" The new BBC Wales headquarters and a base for HMRC are some of the developments attracting more people to the city centre Professor Andrew Potter said an issue facing the whole of the UK, not just Wales, is that there have been delays of two years in replacement trains being delivered. Their arrival should see the older Pacer trains disappear by July. However, he does not envisage more significant changes until 2022, when trains being built specifically for the Metro start operating. ""When the new rail franchise started, much was made about how people's journeys would be changed,"" said the Cardiff University professor. ""And, while this wasn't going to happen immediately, now we are 12 months in, the expectation of change has started to rise yet the service does for many users remain similar to before."" The Cardiff city centre redevelopment continues at pace with the former Brains Brewery site set to be turned into Central Quay A TfW spokesman said three quarters of a billion pounds would be pumped into the Valley Lines as part of the South Wales Metro scheme. ""Customers can expect to see a transformation of services from 2022-23 after the arrival of our new rolling stock, which will allow us to provide faster, greener, more frequent services, and 65% more capacity across our entire network,"" he said. ""In the mean time, we're currently introducing more modern trains in south Wales, providing space for 6,500 extra customers every week on our busiest services."" More trains will arrive later this year, putting the oldest out of service and increasing capacity further. The Welsh Government said it was working with TfW. ""Metro reforms will see improved rail as part of an integrated public transport network, and we want it to be easier for people in Wales to use all forms of public transport,"" it said. ""We will be bringing forward legislation to improve bus services as part of wider bus reform. ""It will include provisions such as franchising, and improvements to public information."" More than Â£40m in grants for active travel - such as walking and cycling - will also be given to local authorities.

EU 'will not be rushed' on Brexit trade deal,"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: ""Just because British law says something, doesn't mean that law applies to the other 27 countries"" The EU ""will not be rushed"" on a trade deal with the UK after Brexit, according to Ireland's deputy PM. Boris Johnson says a deal can be agreed by the end of 2020 and has included a pledge in his Brexit bill not to extend any transition period to secure one. But Simon Coveney says it is ""probably going to take longer than a year"". Security Minister Brandon Lewis defended Mr Johnson's deadline, saying he had a ""strong record of getting things done"". After the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, it will enter an 11-month transition period, where it will largely follow EU rules but will not have any representation in the bloc's institutions. This period will come to an end on 31 December and Mr Johnson has ruled out extending it any further if a deal on the future relationship between the UK and EU has not been agreed. MPs give final backing to Brexit bill What a difference a majority makes What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What is the transition period? The promise is included in the prime minister's Brexit bill, which was voted through by MPs earlier this week and will now head to the House of Lords before becoming law. But opposition parties have raised concerns about the hard deadline, saying it creates another way of the UK leaving without a deal. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Coveney said he accepted the UK was leaving the EU at the end of January, and he hoped for the future deal to ""achieve the closest possible relationship"" between the two sides. But he warned there was ""no way of the UK... maintaining the same relationship we have today while outside the European Union,"" adding: ""That is the reality of Brexit, I'm afraid."" This video can not be played Security Minister Brandon Lewis: ""We're very ambitious for a good, holistic agreement across security"" Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had ""set a very ambitious timetable"" in his bill. ""Just because a British parliament decides that British law says something doesn't mean that law applies to the other 27 countries of the European Union,"" he added. ""The European Union will approach this on the basis of getting the best deal possible, a fair and balanced deal, to ensure the UK and the EU can interact as friends in the future. ""But the EU will not be rushed on this just because Britain passes law."" The deputy prime minister (Tanaiste) said the EU had ""constantly warned [Mr Johnson's] timeframe is ambitious, if not unrealistic"". ""From an EU perspective, we will try to approach all of these really important and sensitive areas with a sense of partnership and friendship. ""But at the same time, they are complex... [and] in my view, it is probably going to take longer than a year. But we will have to wait and see."" This video can not be played EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will remain ""best of friends and partners"" Government minister Mr Lewis admitted the negotiations would be difficult, but he disagreed with Mr Coveney's assessment of the timetable. ""I think we can do it,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""I think it can be done, not just because both partiesâ¦ are committed to doing it, and want to do it, but we are a country that has already got a known pattern of work with the EU. ""Therefore getting a holistic agreement in the next 12 months is achievable"". Mr Coveney's comments followed a speech by new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this week,saying it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. She warned that without an extension to the transition period beyond 2020 ""you cannot expect to agree every single aspect of our new partnership"". She called the deadline ""very tight"". Mrs von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, took over from Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of December. She met Mr Johnson for talks in London last week.

Department store Beales warns of collapse risk,"One of Britain's oldest department stores has warned that it could collapse into administration. Beales, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, said 22 stores and 1,000 jobs were at stake if it cannot find a buyer. The firm is negotiating with its landlords to try and agree rent reductions. It is also in talks with two potential buyers - a rival retailer and a venture capital investor, the BBC understands. Chief Executive Tony Brown led a management buyout of the firm in 2018. By Rob Young, BBC business correspondent It's a brutal time for retailers. Debenhams began closing 19 shops yesterday. Mothercare's 79 UK stores will stop trading today. Now Beales, with its 22 stores up and down the country, confirmed that it may have to call in administrators. Beales has been around for almost 140 years, but poorer than expected trading over Christmas threatens its survival. Even if its immediate future can be assured, store closures aren't being ruled out, with a risk to jobs. The British Retail Consortium said last year was the high street's worst on record. In the year to March 2019, Beale Ltd posted a loss of Â£3.1m, up from Â£1.3m for the year earlier as costs swelled and sales dipped. Beales has stores in the following towns and cities: Beccles Bedford Bournemouth Chipping Norton Diss Fareham Hexham Keighley Kendal Lowestoft Mansfield Perth Peterborough Poole Skegness Southport Spalding St Neots Tonbridge Wisbech Worthing Yeovil It comes after UK retail salesfell for the first time in a quarter of a century last year. Sales in November and December fell by 0.9%, according to industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC). John Lewis has warned that its staff bonus may be in doubt as it reported Christmas sales at its department stores were down 2% for stores open at least a year. Last week, fashion chain Superdry warned that its profits could be wiped out after sales fell sharply over Christmas. The firm, which has been trying to sell more clothes at full price, said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of promotional activity"" by rivals. A raft of collapses in 2019 including Jessops, card chain Clintons, Bonmarche and Karen Millen depressed rents and hit landlords. Some companies are prospering, however. Sports fashion retailer JD Sports says it expects to report full-year profits at the top end of forecasts. Next lifted its profit forecast after better than expected sales over Christmas trading period. The company's full-price sales rose by 5.2%. And big companies are using the tough environment to experiment. Ikea will open its first small-format store in the UK, following the acquisition of a shopping centre in London. The Swedish retail giant paid Â£170m for the Kings Mall Shopping Centre in Hammersmith.

How might Harry and Meghan make money?Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sightsCould couple's move make media intrusion worse?Your questions: Is Harry still sixth in line to the throne?,"Meghan and Harry have a global appeal, but how could they make money? The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have agreed to stop using their HRH titles as part of their plans to withdraw from royal duties and ""work to become financially independent"". BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said royals were usually excluded from doing paid work, but by setting aside their titles the couple had gained more freedom. ""Of course once you lose the title then you are no longer royal and special, and it may be that your brand is much less attractive to potential partners,"" he said. Your questions: Is Harry still sixth in line to the throne? Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Jonny Dymond: How they want to do their own thing Public relations consultant Mark Borkowski said even without their titles, the couple are ""powerful A-listers in their own right, so they're going to attract a lot of attention"". Prince Harry and Meghan plan to split their time between the UK and North America - and their global reach could open up a wealth of opportunities. But how might they earn their financial independence and fund their charitable causes? An application to trademark the Sussex Royal brand was lodged by the couple in June last year, covering items such as books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising and campaigning. It raised the possibility of Prince Harry and Meghan launching their own lines of products, from beauty to clothing. But the agreement with the Queen has cast doubt on that idea. A brand incorporating the word ""royal"" may not be compatible with their agreement to step back from royal duties, while upholding ""the values of Her Majesty"". Journalist and royal style commentator Elizabeth Holmes says criticism for exploiting the royal connection is a risk in any commercial venture, adding: ""That's why I think they'll be careful about it."" Meghan is a royal patron of Smart Works and helped style women during a visit to the charity last year Even if they have to go back to the drawing board with the Sussex Royal name, Ms Holmes says: ""Any brand on the planet would want to work with them."" Whether it's a designer handbag orArchie's hand-knitted bobble hat, whenever the Sussexes are pictured with a product, sales go through the roof. We probably shouldn't expect the couple's 10.5 million Instagram followers to be suddenly bombarded with sponsored content and product placement though, Ms Holmes says. Brands hoping for boost from Meghanâs maternity style Why the fashion industry loves Meghan Markle While the royal couple have a huge platform, it pales in comparison to the likes of Kylie Jenner, who has more than 150 million Instagram followers. The reality TV star,who topped last year's Instagram rich list, is estimated to earn around $1.2m (Â£960,000) for a single sponsored post. Could Meghan and Harry follow that trend? Ms Holmes says: ""I don't think that's necessarily an appropriate thing for a member of the Royal Family."" The duke and duchess have said they plan to launch a charitable organisation to achieve ""progressive change"" through ""local and global community action"". Ms Holmes suggests any commercial partnerships would be tied to the couple's charitable causes, perhaps with a secondary opportunity to raise personal income. For example, Meghan is the patron ofa charity that provides free clothing and interview training to unemployed womenand has launched her own clothing line for the organisation. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights Could royal couple's move make media intrusion worse? While the couple may be legally allowed to draw a salary from their charity, that is not the approach taken by some of their likely inspirations. Harry and Meghan said they ""researched the incredible work of many well-known and lesser-known foundations"" in drawing up their plans. Organisations such as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have been suggested as potential models. But the Clintons say they draw no income or expenses from their charity, the Obamas are not listed among their foundation's highest-paid officers, and Mr and Mrs Gates famously use their organisation to give away wealth rather than to receive it. With Meghan first finding fame as an actress in the US television drama Suits, it is perhaps no surprise that some of the couple's first opportunities have come from the entertainment world. Harry has alreadyteamed up with US media mogul Oprah Winfrey on a series addressing mental health for Apple TV, which is due for broadcast in 2020. And when the duke and duchess announced their intention to ""step back"", it was revealed that Meghan has already signed a voiceover deal with Disney in return for a donation to an elephant conservation charity. Oprah Winfrey was a guest at the duke and duchess' wedding Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has already expressed an interest in working with the couple. ""Who wouldn't be interested? Yes, sure,"" he said. That could represent a chance to follow in the steps of the Obamas, who signed a deal with the streaming video company to producedocumentaries and drama series about social and political issues. A similar deal could give the duke and duchess an opportunity to highlight causes close to their hearts. For Meghan, these include equality and women's rights, while Harry has been vocal in campaigning on mental health and military veterans' welfare. While the couple have spoken about their struggles with the intense media interest in their lives, the idea of revealing more about themselves in their own words might be more appealing - and lucrative. The 2017 book deal signed by Barack and Michelle Obamawas believed to be worth more than $60m (Â£48m). It's also an area Meghan has previously shown an interest in.In her introduction to last year's September issue of Vogue,external, which she guest edited, Meghan wrote of her ""love of writing"". Before she married Harry, she also ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig,where she shared beauty, fashion and travel tips. Michelle Obama's memoir sold more than 10 million copies in its first five months Natalie Jerome, a literary agent at Aevitas, says the couple have ""enormous power and reach"" and any book deal would be extremely lucrative. ""People have compared them to the Obamas and I think there's potentially some merit in that,"" she says. Meghan is an aspirational figure for many women of colour and young people, she adds. ""We're in a period now where we're talking increasingly about diversity within publishing and there's a real push to reach wider audiences,"" she says. ""If she were to publish a book in her own right and reach out to young people on the ground by doing talks and going to schools like Michelle Obama did, I think the book would be hugely successful."" Another potential avenue for the pair to explore could be after-dinner speeches and events. Jeremy Lee, director at speaking agency JLA, says if they maintained a positive profile the couple could earn six-figure sums for each appearance. He predicts demand would be higher in US, where Mr Lee says the pair could earn up to $500,000 (Â£380,000) per engagement. However, he says companies in the UK would be more sensitive to reputational risk if public opinion turned against the couple. Mr Lee predicts UK companies would only be willing to take the royals as speakers at an event linked to one of their campaigning interests, in return for a donation to their charitable foundation - rather than a fee - in the region of Â£100,000. But in the US, there would be interest from ""anybody that wants to show off and has got the budget"", he says.

Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sightsCould couple's move make media intrusion worse?Your questions: Is Harry still sixth in line to the throne?,"This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their intention to step back as ""senior"" royals and live part-time in North America, Canada has been aflutter. Will the royal couple make the great North their home? Where will they live? What will they do? While we do not know where they intend to settle, it was confirmed to the BBC's royal correspondent that Meghan had left for Canada. She and the prince had been in the UK to make their announcement, following a six-week Christmas holiday in greater Victoria, on Vancouver Island. Our correspondent said Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by the couple's statement. Here's why we shouldn't be surprised by their interest in Canada. Meghan returns to Canada as Queen seeks solution Harry and Meghan step back: What we know so far Where do they get their money? The pair were spotted hiking in the woods outside of Victoria over the holidays, according to Canadian media. Musician David Foster, who is originally from the area, told the Daily Mail that he helped arrange for them to stayon the secluded estate of a friend.,externalHis wife Katherine McPhee went to secondary school with Meghan in Los Angeles.

Since then, international media has flocked to the city amid speculation that the couple may decide to settle there semi-permanently. ""There's media from across the country and around the world, and from your country from across the pond that are already looking to set up shop here,"" Scott Fee, the news director at local CHEK-TV, told BBC Breakfast. ""So the tabloids are en route if not already here."" A deluge of press is probably precisely not what the royal couple was hoping for. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight, and they hinted at it in their recent announcement regarding their decision to live part-time in North America. ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" read their statement, which was posted on the couple's official Instagram on 8 January. Meghan has had close ties to Canada for many years, although she is an American citizen by birth and her mother lives in California. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry share a joke She lived in Toronto for six years while filming the television series Suits. During their courtship, Prince Harry visited her in her Seaton Village home, and she joined him at the 2017 Invictus Games, which were held in the city. Her ties to Toronto did not sever when she moved across the pond. The Mulroneys, Meghan Markle and her life among Toronto 'royalty' One of her closest friends, Jessica Mulroney, lives in Toronto with her husband, Ben Mulroney, the son of a former prime minister. Their three young children were even a part of Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding party. It has been speculated, but not confirmed, that baby Archie stayed with the Mulroney clan this week while Meghan and the prince flew to the UK. By and large, what Canada can offer the royal couple is a degree of privacy and informality that they are not afforded in the UK. Although Canadian media has certainly taken a keen interest in their exploits here, Canada just doesn't have the same tabloid culture or paparazzi as Britain or the US. The country also has a lot more secluded spots where they could, if they wanted to, hide away from the flash of bulbs. Don't think creepy log cabin in the woods - think luxurious estates on pristine lakes surrounded by pine trees, located on dirt roads that would make it difficult for caravans of photographers to follow their trail. It is telling that there was not a single paparazzi photograph of the couple during the six weeks they were on Vancouver Island. Allow Twitter content?

They certainly wouldn't be the first royal to make Canada their home. Prince Andrew, Prince Harry's paternal uncle who has come under scrutiny since the arrest and suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, spent six months on exchange at Lakefield College School, and maintained close ties with the school's community after leaving. Princess Patricia of Connaught, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, lived in Canada with her parents when her father, Prince Arthur, was appointed the governor general. There, she was greatly beloved and her portrait was even used on the one-dollar banknote issued in 1917. Indeed, prior to 1952, all of Canada's governors-general were part of the British aristocracy, which has led some to speculate that Prince Harry could carry on the tradition. How they want to do their own thing In 2018, writing for the National Post, Tristan Hopper suggested that the Duke of Sussex should consider taking on the role. It's appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to be her representative in the Canada. ""One of the chief pitfalls of the job of governor general is that it takes smart, ambitious Canadians and essentially imprisons them in a palace with strict instructions to do what they're told,"" he wrote. ""Prince Harry had lived his whole life in an unreal bubble of security and privilege where even the slightest partisan nod could yield a week's worth of Daily Mail headlines. If there's anyone who knows how to be clothed in immense power that they never, ever use, it's the House of Windsor."" This week, a poll conducted for the Postmedia newspaper chain by Dart and Maru/Blue Voice Canada also suggested that 60% of Canadians would approve if he were to become governor general. One thing the royal couple might need to consider is immigration laws. Canada is part of the Commonwealth and Prince Harry's grandmother the Queen is the head of state so although he will see her face on the currency, he's not a citizen. As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spend up to six months a year as a visitor in Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa. As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife. The couple have come under fire in the UK after the BBC revealed the palace was not informed of their decision to step down from most of their royal duties, and to seek to become financially independent. World's media split on royal move Writing in the Daily Mail, Piers Morgan said the couple wants to ""keep all the trappings of royal life without any of the hard, boring bits, and the right to cash in on their status however they choose"". But Canadian media has taken a decidedly more friendly tone. In the Globe and Mail, Anne Donahue expressed glee that the couple might be moving to Canada, and called their decision to step away from the royal circusa ""fairy-tale ending"",external. ""Meghan and Harry's choice to step back has sparked the type of change in which everybody wins. They've begun to help dismantle an institution that often seems a historical relic. And they're very publicly choosing to stop putting up with the nonsense, on their own dime and in their own way - a power move."" Not everyone is thrilled. On Friday, the Monarchist League of Canada cautioned Prince Harry and Meghan that ""any public support for their desire to occupy a new, hybrid role combining their royal status with more personal freedom could disappear quickly were there to develop a feeling that, even inadvertently, they had in some way showed disrespect to The Queen, whose style is self-effacing and whose watchword is duty."" But by and large, Canadians are pretty chuffed at the idea - and they're willing to sweeten the pot if it will help convince them to stay. Coffee-and-doughnuts franchise Tim Hortons offered them free coffee for life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That promotion led to considerable backlash of its own. Some of the company's franchises have come under fire over staff wages, and for how they treat homeless patrons, and many took to Twitter to tell Tim Hortons their money should be going to the community, not the Sussexes. ""Wow, talk about tone-deaf. Sort out paying your workers a living wage before you start giving freebies to the rich,"" tweeted Erin Carson DeWolfe.

Britain condemns Iran's arrest of UK ambassador,"Britain has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Rob Macaire was detained for a short time on Saturday night after attending a vigil for those who died when Iran's military shot down a passenger plane. He left the vigil when it turned into a protest but was later accused of helping to organise the demonstrations. Iran said he was ""an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering"" and summoned him to the foreign ministry on Sunday. In a statement, Iran's foreign ministry said Mr Macaire was ""reminded"" that his presence at ""illegal gatherings contravened"" the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Macaire was understood to have protested strongly that his detention was unjustified. Our correspondent says Mr Macaire made clear any suggestion that he was involved in demonstrations was completely untrue, and he was attending an event advertised as a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's crash -which killed 176 people, including four Britons. Iran faces watershed moment Iran admits 'unintentionally' shooting down plane What we know about the Iran plane crash Earlier, Iran's deputy foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, who denied Mr Macaire was detained, said in a tweet that he thought it ""impossible"" when police first told him that the UK ambassador had been arrested. A phone conversation confirmed Mr Macaire's identity and he was released 15 minutes later, Mr Araghchi added. Mr Macaire has denied taking part in protests and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned his arrest. He was arrested and held for three hours when he stopped at a barber shop for a haircut on his way back to the UK embassy. In a tweet,externalthe ambassador said he was attending the vigil because it was ""normal to want to pay respects"", adding that some of the victims were British. The ambassador added: ""Arresting diplomats is of course illegal, in all countries."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned Mr Macaire's arrest in a joint statement following a phone call on Sunday, in which they discussed their ""shared interests in ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon"". And Security Minister Brandon Lewis said on Sunday that the UK ambassador's arrest was ""totally unacceptable"" and a breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention. ""Iran does need to step back from that kind of activity and play a proper part in working with partners to de-escalate,"" Mr Lewis told Sky's Sophy Ridge. Under the convention, diplomats cannot be detained. The Foreign Office is to demand a full explanation. In a statement issued on Saturday night Mr Raab added: ""The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law. ""The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards."" The Iranian Etemad newspaper shared a picture of the ambassador on Twitter after the Tasnim news agency reported his arrest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Protesters had taken to the streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, to vent anger at officials, calling them liars for having denied, then admitting, shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. Iran had initially denied responsibility for the plane crash, but on Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani admitted Iranian military had ""unintentionally"" shot down the passenger plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile when it turned towards a sensitive military site. President Rouhani said the missile strike was an ""unforgivable mistake"". The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Mr Johnson said Iran's admission was an ""important first step"" and called for an investigation into the ""tragic accident"". And writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Raab said,externalit was time for Tehran ""to come to the negotiating table to resolve all of Iran's issues of international concern."" He said Iran ""must stop pursuing a nuclear weapon, end its support for terrorism, and release the foreign nationals and dual nationals it cruelly holds"". This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the shooting down of the passenger plane by Iran was ""an appalling act, and part of a whole pattern of appalling acts all across the region"". The Queen has also sent a message of condolence to the Governor-General of Canada - where the majority of the passengers on the flight were headed. Out of the 176 victims on board the Kyiv-bound flight, 138 had listed Canada as their eventual destination. The Queen said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"". The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall added their condolences, saying they were ""utterly horrified"" by the disaster.

"'I've paid $250,000 for a ticket into space'","Ketty Maisonrouge has tried on her spacesuit and is ready for take off Ketty Maisonrouge has waited 15 years for a trip that she knows will be out of this world. The 61-year-old business school professor signed up back in 2005 for the promise of five minutes in zero-gravity, paying $250,000 (Â£190,500) to travel beyond the earth's atmosphere. Now the company that sold her the ticket, Virgin Galactic, says it will finally begin flights this year.  Its founder, Sir Richard Branson, will be on the first trip, and Mrs Maisonrouge won't be far behind. ""Hopefully it will be as amazing as I think,"" says Mrs Maisonrouge. If all goes to plan, Virgin Galactic will be the first private company to take tourists into space. The company says 600 people have already purchased tickets, including celebrities like Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. But rival firms are close behind. Blue Origin, started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has also starting speaking to possible passengers for trips it hopes to start this year, while SpaceX, founded by Tesla's Elon Musk, announced in 2019 that a Japanese billionaire would be its first passenger for a trip around the moon. Nasa has announced it will allow private space tourists to visit the International Space Station for a fee In 2019, Swiss bank UBS released a report estimating space tourism could become a $3bn industry in the next 10 years. For Virgin Galactic, early buyers such as Mrs Maisonrouge helped prove the demand was there for private space travel - even with ticket prices at a quarter of a million dollars. ""To be able to put products as expensive as space on the market in the first place does include a high premium,"" explains Julia Hunter, a senior vice-president at Virgin Galactic responsible for the day-to-day running of the human spaceflight programme. Mrs Maisonrouge's love of space started early. She can still remember vividly the moment in July 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. When she learned that Virgin Galactic was offering to send ordinary travellers to space, she immediately rushed to sign up. Since buying her ticket, Mrs Maisonrouge has kept her plans mostly private, sharing them only with family, close friends and her fellow ""founders"" - the group of original Virgin Galactic ticket holders. In November 2019, a group of them got their first chance to try on the spacesuits - designed by sportswear brand Under Armour - which they will wear on their trip to space. ""For me, it was like the realisation that this is really going to happen soon,"" says Mrs Maisonrouge. ""When you've been waiting for 15 years, when you've been dreaming about it for as long as you can remember, you wonder until it happens if it will really happen."" Ketty Maisonrouge has experienced zero gravity as part of her preparation Unlike the astronauts from the legendary Apollo missions, who went through months of rigorous training and gruelling physical ordeals, Mrs Maisonrouge and her fellow space tourists will take just three days to train for their trip.  Virgin Galactic says it could be shorter, but they want passengers to ""understand the choreography"" and ""get the most"" out of their experience. She and fellow founders have also been given an early chance to visit Virgin Galactic's terminal at Spaceport America, in the desert of New Mexico. The company has designed a lounge equipped with floor-to-ceiling windows to view the launches, a barista to make fresh coffee and an interactive walkway. Virgin Galactic's lounge is the first of what Spaceport America hopes will be many terminals at the complex From here, Virgin Galactic's tourists will board spaceships for a 90-minute round trip with just a few minutes in low-orbit. It's a far more luxurious experience from the one that government astronauts have had. Dan Hicks, who manages Spaceport America for the state of New Mexico, says Virgin Galactic is spearheading this new type of travel and that the facility will one day be a ""full-up transportation hub for the space industry"". A quarter of a million dollars may seem like a hefty price tag for a tourist trip. But Virgin Galactic says it expects near-term demand for space flights to far outstrip supply, which could even cause the price of tickets to rise. Seven private citizens have already paid for multi-million dollar tickets to go into space with Russian Soyuz spaceflights going back as far as 2001, making them the first space tourists. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has also relied on Soyuz spaceships to take US astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) since it ended its shuttle program in 2011, paying approximately $86m per spot. SpaceX has partnered with Nasa to send astronauts to space at a cost of nearly $55m per ticket Nasa is now also turning to private enterprise. The agency has signed deals with SpaceX and Boeing to carry US astronauts. Those tickets don't come cheap either - Nasa is paying SpaceX $55m per spot and Boeing $90m. Spaceflights for government astronauts and space tourists are only part of the potential private space industry. Point-to-point travel that leaves Earth's orbit could become a $20bn sector by 2030, according to UBS. By leaving the planet's orbit, trips across the world would be much faster. SpaceX has already released marketing material for a 40-minute flight from New York City to Shanghai, using its spaceflight technology. That could mean far more of us get the chance to sample space travel, at least briefly. Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson celebrating after the company became the first human spaceflight company to list on the New York Stock Exchange The space travel industry has caught the eye not just of billionaire businessmen such as Sir Richard and Jeff Bezos, but also Wall Street investors. Virgin Galactic became the first human space flight company to list its shares on the stock market in October 2019. For the many people hoping to make money from space tourism, 2020 could be the year when stellar promises really start to take off.

Iran's leaders face pressure over downed plane,"This video can not be played Students at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran refused to walk over US and Israeli flags in an apparent show of defiance against Iran's government Iran's leaders have faced a second day of protests following their admission the military shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board, many of them Iranians. Protesters in Tehran and in several other cities chanted slogans against the leadership. Clashes with security forces and the firing of tear gas are reported. Iran admitted ""unintentionally"" hitting the plane after initially denying it, amid rising tensions with the US. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Iran faces watershed moment What we know about flight PS752 Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Demonstrators attended new protests despite a large deployment of security forces. Riot police, members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on motorbikes, and plainclothes security officials were out in force. Revolutionary Guards - what do they do? Iran's only female Olympic medallist defects In one apparently symbolic act rejecting state propaganda, video showed students taking care not to walk over US and Israeli flags painted on the ground at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran. In some social media clips, protesters can be heard chanting anti-government slogans, including: ""They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here."" Many of the protesters are women. Social media footage showed clapping and chanting protesters in Tehran's Azadi Square. BBC Persian says there has been a crackdown there by security forces, with tear gas fired. The semi-official Fars news agency said up to 1,000 people were protesting at various points in the capital. Protests were also reported in other cities. This video can not be played A crowd gathered outside Amir Kabir university on Saturday, calling for resignations and accusing officials of lying Those who decide to continue demonstrating will be mindful of the violence with which the security forces have dealt with protest movements in the past, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. On Saturday, students had gathered outside two universities. They initially did so to pay respect to the victims, but angry protests erupted later in the evening and tear gas was reportedly fired to disperse them. A number of Iranian newspapers have covered the vigils for the plane victims alongside headlines such as ""Shame"" and ""Unforgivable"". But there has also been praise for what one pro-government newspaper called Iran's ""honest"" admission of error. There were also protests on Sunday in Tehran in support of Soleimani, and opposing the US and UK. US President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated warnings that Iran should not target anti-government protesters, saying, ""the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching"".

Britain, meanwhile, has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran in Tehran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Rob Macaire was detained after attending a vigil where he was paying respects to victims of the crash, some of whom were British. UK condemns ambassador's arrest in Tehran Mr Macaire said he left the vigil when some people started chanting and had played no part in the demonstration. Protesters burn a UK and an Israeli flag in Tehran Iran on Sunday summoned the ambassador to complain about ""his unconventional behaviour of attending an illegal rally"", the foreign ministry website said. Iranian protesters set a UK flag alight in front of the UK embassy on Sunday. In other developments on Sunday: US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that he ""didn't see"" specific evidence that Iran was preparing attacks against US embassies.President Trump had said on Friday he believed four embassies were under threat. Mr Esper said he shared the president's belief that there ""probably and could've been attacks on additional embassies"" Eight Katyusha rockets were fired at the Balad air base, which has housed US forces north of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. Four Iraqis were wounded. There have been several recent attacks on the base blamed on Iranian-backed militias Hundreds of mourners are attending memorials in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Edmonton, At the latter,  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the crowd he would pursue justice and accountability on behalf of their families and friends BBC's Jessica Murphy, Edmonton, Alberta Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand gazed out from the photograph projected on the screen with wide smiles, looking like they had been caught laughing at a shared joke. The ""sweet couple"" likely were. Along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9, they were remembered for their quickness to laughter, their generosity, their full embrace of life. The family of four were among the 13 victims of flight PS752 who came from the Canadian city of Edmonton. A crowd of some 2,300 people packed into a university gym on Sunday to pay respects to those lost - family, close friends colleagues, classmates -  whose death has left a hole in so many lives. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the crowd that in their sorrow ""your entire country stands with you"". A friend of Pedram's, through a letter read by his former student Hossein Saghlatoon, said the loss was ""too much to bear"". He was looking forward to many more memorable moments with Pedram and his family, he wrote ""but alas, the cruel hand of destiny had some other plans"". For three days, Iran denied reports its missiles had brought down the plane, with one spokesman accusing Western nations of ""lying and engaging in psychological warfare"". But on Saturday morning, a statement read on state TV accepted the plane had been shot down. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, said a missile operator had acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a ""cruise missile"". This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran He also said he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday, raising questions about why Iran had denied involvement for so long.

Why they have Canada in their sights,"This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their intention to step back as ""senior"" royals and live part-time in North America, Canada has been aflutter. Will the royal couple make the great North their home? Where will they live? What will they do? While we do not know where they intend to settle, it was confirmed to the BBC's royal correspondent that Meghan had left for Canada. She and the prince had been in the UK to make their announcement, following a six-week Christmas holiday in greater Victoria, on Vancouver Island. Our correspondent said Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by the couple's statement. Here's why we shouldn't be surprised by their interest in Canada. Meghan returns to Canada as Queen seeks solution Harry and Meghan step back: What we know so far Where do they get their money? The pair were spotted hiking in the woods outside of Victoria over the holidays, according to Canadian media. Musician David Foster, who is originally from the area, told the Daily Mail that he helped arrange for them to stayon the secluded estate of a friend.,externalHis wife Katherine McPhee went to secondary school with Meghan in Los Angeles.

Since then, international media has flocked to the city amid speculation that the couple may decide to settle there semi-permanently. ""There's media from across the country and around the world, and from your country from across the pond that are already looking to set up shop here,"" Scott Fee, the news director at local CHEK-TV, told BBC Breakfast. ""So the tabloids are en route if not already here."" A deluge of press is probably precisely not what the royal couple was hoping for. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight, and they hinted at it in their recent announcement regarding their decision to live part-time in North America. ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" read their statement, which was posted on the couple's official Instagram on 8 January. Meghan has had close ties to Canada for many years, although she is an American citizen by birth and her mother lives in California. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry share a joke She lived in Toronto for six years while filming the television series Suits. During their courtship, Prince Harry visited her in her Seaton Village home, and she joined him at the 2017 Invictus Games, which were held in the city. Her ties to Toronto did not sever when she moved across the pond. The Mulroneys, Meghan Markle and her life among Toronto 'royalty' One of her closest friends, Jessica Mulroney, lives in Toronto with her husband, Ben Mulroney, the son of a former prime minister. Their three young children were even a part of Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding party. It has been speculated, but not confirmed, that baby Archie stayed with the Mulroney clan this week while Meghan and the prince flew to the UK. By and large, what Canada can offer the royal couple is a degree of privacy and informality that they are not afforded in the UK. Although Canadian media has certainly taken a keen interest in their exploits here, Canada just doesn't have the same tabloid culture or paparazzi as Britain or the US. The country also has a lot more secluded spots where they could, if they wanted to, hide away from the flash of bulbs. Don't think creepy log cabin in the woods - think luxurious estates on pristine lakes surrounded by pine trees, located on dirt roads that would make it difficult for caravans of photographers to follow their trail. It is telling that there was not a single paparazzi photograph of the couple during the six weeks they were on Vancouver Island. Allow Twitter content?

They certainly wouldn't be the first royal to make Canada their home. Prince Andrew, Prince Harry's paternal uncle who has come under scrutiny since the arrest and suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, spent six months on exchange at Lakefield College School, and maintained close ties with the school's community after leaving. Princess Patricia of Connaught, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, lived in Canada with her parents when her father, Prince Arthur, was appointed the governor general. There, she was greatly beloved and her portrait was even used on the one-dollar banknote issued in 1917. Indeed, prior to 1952, all of Canada's governors-general were part of the British aristocracy, which has led some to speculate that Prince Harry could carry on the tradition. How they want to do their own thing In 2018, writing for the National Post, Tristan Hopper suggested that the Duke of Sussex should consider taking on the role. It's appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to be her representative in the Canada. ""One of the chief pitfalls of the job of governor general is that it takes smart, ambitious Canadians and essentially imprisons them in a palace with strict instructions to do what they're told,"" he wrote. ""Prince Harry had lived his whole life in an unreal bubble of security and privilege where even the slightest partisan nod could yield a week's worth of Daily Mail headlines. If there's anyone who knows how to be clothed in immense power that they never, ever use, it's the House of Windsor."" This week, a poll conducted for the Postmedia newspaper chain by Dart and Maru/Blue Voice Canada also suggested that 60% of Canadians would approve if he were to become governor general. One thing the royal couple might need to consider is immigration laws. Canada is part of the Commonwealth and Prince Harry's grandmother the Queen is the head of state so although he will see her face on the currency, he's not a citizen. As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spend up to six months a year as a visitor in Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa. As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife. The couple have come under fire in the UK after the BBC revealed the palace was not informed of their decision to step down from most of their royal duties, and to seek to become financially independent. World's media split on royal move Writing in the Daily Mail, Piers Morgan said the couple wants to ""keep all the trappings of royal life without any of the hard, boring bits, and the right to cash in on their status however they choose"". But Canadian media has taken a decidedly more friendly tone. In the Globe and Mail, Anne Donahue expressed glee that the couple might be moving to Canada, and called their decision to step away from the royal circusa ""fairy-tale ending"",external. ""Meghan and Harry's choice to step back has sparked the type of change in which everybody wins. They've begun to help dismantle an institution that often seems a historical relic. And they're very publicly choosing to stop putting up with the nonsense, on their own dime and in their own way - a power move."" Not everyone is thrilled. On Friday, the Monarchist League of Canada cautioned Prince Harry and Meghan that ""any public support for their desire to occupy a new, hybrid role combining their royal status with more personal freedom could disappear quickly were there to develop a feeling that, even inadvertently, they had in some way showed disrespect to The Queen, whose style is self-effacing and whose watchword is duty."" But by and large, Canadians are pretty chuffed at the idea - and they're willing to sweeten the pot if it will help convince them to stay.

That promotion led to considerable backlash of its own. Some of the company's franchises have come under fire over staff wages, and for how they treat homeless patrons, and many took to Twitter to tell Tim Hortons their money should be going to the community, not the Sussexes.

Eight migrant children drown off Turkey,"The Turkish Coast Guard rescued eight people from the waters off Cesme Eight children were among the 11 migrants who drowned when their boat sank off Turkey's western coast, state media report. Eight other people were rescued from the waters off Cesme, a tourist resort on the Aegean coast opposite the Greek island of Chios. Their nationalities are not yet known. Turkey has been a key transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe, mainly via Greece. Many are fleeing violence and persecution in their countries. Many rely on people smugglers and face dangerous land and sea routes which often result in deaths. In 2016, Turkey reached a financial deal with the European Union to stem the flow of migrants and refugees to Europe. EU countries warned of 'lost generation' of young refugees How a teenager risked all for a life in limbo The Turkish Coast Guard said it responded to ""screaming sounds"" from the sea at around 20:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Saturday. Cesme is just 15km (nine miles) from Chios, wherethousands of migrants are living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. The number of people crossing from Turkey has risen sharply recently. Most of them are coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Turkish authorities held some 60,000 people trying to cross the Mediterranean last year,,externalwhile almost 9,000 suspected human traffickers were arrested, according to state-run Anadolu news agency. Turkey is home to some four million refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and over 3.6 million of them are from Syria.

"'I've paid Â£250,000 for a ticket into space'","Ketty Maisonrouge has tried on her spacesuit and is ready for take off Ketty Maisonrouge has waited 15 years for a trip that she knows will be out of this world. The 61-year-old business school professor signed up back in 2005 for the promise of five minutes in zero-gravity, paying $250,000 (Â£190,500) to travel beyond the earth's atmosphere. Now the company that sold her the ticket, Virgin Galactic, says it will finally begin flights this year.  Its founder, Sir Richard Branson, will be on the first trip, and Mrs Maisonrouge won't be far behind. ""Hopefully it will be as amazing as I think,"" says Mrs Maisonrouge. If all goes to plan, Virgin Galactic will be the first private company to take tourists into space. The company says 600 people have already purchased tickets, including celebrities like Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. But rival firms are close behind. Blue Origin, started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has also starting speaking to possible passengers for trips it hopes to start this year, while SpaceX, founded by Tesla's Elon Musk, announced in 2019 that a Japanese billionaire would be its first passenger for a trip around the moon. Nasa has announced it will allow private space tourists to visit the International Space Station for a fee In 2019, Swiss bank UBS released a report estimating space tourism could become a $3bn industry in the next 10 years. For Virgin Galactic, early buyers such as Mrs Maisonrouge helped prove the demand was there for private space travel - even with ticket prices at a quarter of a million dollars. ""To be able to put products as expensive as space on the market in the first place does include a high premium,"" explains Julia Hunter, a senior vice-president at Virgin Galactic responsible for the day-to-day running of the human spaceflight programme. Mrs Maisonrouge's love of space started early. She can still remember vividly the moment in July 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. When she learned that Virgin Galactic was offering to send ordinary travellers to space, she immediately rushed to sign up. Since buying her ticket, Mrs Maisonrouge has kept her plans mostly private, sharing them only with family, close friends and her fellow ""founders"" - the group of original Virgin Galactic ticket holders. In November 2019, a group of them got their first chance to try on the spacesuits - designed by sportswear brand Under Armour - which they will wear on their trip to space. ""For me, it was like the realisation that this is really going to happen soon,"" says Mrs Maisonrouge. ""When you've been waiting for 15 years, when you've been dreaming about it for as long as you can remember, you wonder until it happens if it will really happen."" Ketty Maisonrouge has experienced zero gravity as part of her preparation Unlike the astronauts from the legendary Apollo missions, who went through months of rigorous training and gruelling physical ordeals, Mrs Maisonrouge and her fellow space tourists will take just three days to train for their trip.  Virgin Galactic says it could be shorter, but they want passengers to ""understand the choreography"" and ""get the most"" out of their experience. She and fellow founders have also been given an early chance to visit Virgin Galactic's terminal at Spaceport America, in the desert of New Mexico. The company has designed a lounge equipped with floor-to-ceiling windows to view the launches, a barista to make fresh coffee and an interactive walkway. Virgin Galactic's lounge is the first of what Spaceport America hopes will be many terminals at the complex From here, Virgin Galactic's tourists will board spaceships for a 90-minute round trip with just a few minutes in low-orbit. It's a far more luxurious experience from the one that government astronauts have had. Dan Hicks, who manages Spaceport America for the state of New Mexico, says Virgin Galactic is spearheading this new type of travel and that the facility will one day be a ""full-up transportation hub for the space industry"". A quarter of a million dollars may seem like a hefty price tag for a tourist trip. But Virgin Galactic says it expects near-term demand for space flights to far outstrip supply, which could even cause the price of tickets to rise. Seven private citizens have already paid for multi-million dollar tickets to go into space with Russian Soyuz spaceflights going back as far as 2001, making them the first space tourists. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has also relied on Soyuz spaceships to take US astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) since it ended its shuttle program in 2011, paying approximately $86m per spot. SpaceX has partnered with Nasa to send astronauts to space at a cost of nearly $55m per ticket Nasa is now also turning to private enterprise. The agency has signed deals with SpaceX and Boeing to carry US astronauts. Those tickets don't come cheap either - Nasa is paying SpaceX $55m per spot and Boeing $90m. Spaceflights for government astronauts and space tourists are only part of the potential private space industry. Point-to-point travel that leaves Earth's orbit could become a $20bn sector by 2030, according to UBS. By leaving the planet's orbit, trips across the world would be much faster. SpaceX has already released marketing material for a 40-minute flight from New York City to Shanghai, using its spaceflight technology. That could mean far more of us get the chance to sample space travel, at least briefly. Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson celebrating after the company became the first human spaceflight company to list on the New York Stock Exchange The space travel industry has caught the eye not just of billionaire businessmen such as Sir Richard and Jeff Bezos, but also Wall Street investors. Virgin Galactic became the first human space flight company to list its shares on the stock market in October 2019. For the many people hoping to make money from space tourism, 2020 could be the year when stellar promises really start to take off.

"Harry Dunn extradition bid 'inappropriate', says USThe US State Department says it would be an ""abuse"" to send suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK.","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The United States has criticised the UK's request to extradite an American accused of killing motorcyclist Harry Dunn, calling it ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by suspect Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The Home Officesubmitted a request on Fridayto extradite her to the UK. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said she will ""100% be coming back"". ""I have no doubt in my mind, the only thing I can't tell you is when,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This campaign won't stop until Anne Sacoolas is back in the UK facing the justice system. There is no celebration and until she is back, we won't rest. ""This lady is accused of taking Harry's life, then fleeing the country. No-one is above the law in modern society. You don't get to move to a country, break a law in that country and then leave."" Mr Seiger said that under the circumstances, the family was ""really pleased"" the UK authorities had taken the ""huge step towards justice"", but if the Trump administration was to ignore or reject the request, it would be re-presented should another administration come into power. This video can not be played Radd Seiger: Anne Sacoolas will ""100% be coming back...the only thing I can't tell you is when'' The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice. A spokeswoman for the US State Department said: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.""
