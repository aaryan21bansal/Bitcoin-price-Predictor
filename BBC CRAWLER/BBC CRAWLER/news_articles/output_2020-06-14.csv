"Man dies, woman raped and three stabbed at 'raves'Two illegal raves attracted about 6,000 people and led to ""tragic consequences"".Manchester","Police were present as scores of young people made their way to the Carrington area rave A 20-year-old man has died, a woman has been raped and three people have been stabbed during two illegal ""quarantine raves"" that attracted 6,000 people. Thousands flocked to Daisy Nook Country Park and Carrington in Greater Manchester late on Saturday. The man at the country park died of a suspected drug overdose and the stabbings and the attack on an 18-year-old woman took place in Carrington. Police said the illegal raves have had tragic consequences. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes condemned them as a clear breach of coronavirus legislation, adding officers ""were met with violence, resulting in items being thrown and a police car being vandalised"". This video can not be played Volunteers have been clearing up a ""sea of canisters"" and other litter after two illegal raves. Police said about 4,000 people were at the Daisy Nook rave in Failsworth, Oldham, where there were no reported crimes. There were, however, three separate stabbings at the Carrington site - one of which left an 18-year-old man with life-threatening injuries. Police were able to find the man and give him first aid before paramedics arrived. Two other men, aged 25 and 26, were hurt in separate stabbings and a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. ""We are also investigating the rape of an 18-year-old woman... and we have specialist officers supporting her and her family,"" police said. The raves continued through the night People were seen congregating near the rave site Streams of young people were seen on their way to an area just off Common Lane in Carrington on Saturday evening. There was a large police presence at both sites. Images and footage were also shared on social media showing densely-packed crowds of people dancing and singing at the outdoor raves. A large sign reading ""Quarantine Rave"" can be seen in background of one video. Anyone with footage that could help with inquiries has been asked to contact police.

Consumers 'should shop with confidence',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""People should shop, and shop with confidence"" ""People should shop, and shop with confidence"" when non-essential stores reopen in England on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said retail staff were ""excited"" and had done ""a huge amount of work"" to allow for safer shopping. But he said people must continue to respect social distancing measures. It comes as a further 36 deaths from coronavirus were announced in the past 24 hours. It brings the UK death toll - across all settings - to 41,698. The latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 March, but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend, because of a reporting lag. While food shops and pharmacies, as well as other essential retailers including banks and petrol stations, have been open throughout lockdown, non-essential stores, such as book shops and fashion outlets, have been shuttered since 23 March. Coronavirus lockdown: All shops can open on Monday in England Coronavirus: What shops will open next? Five ways shopping will be different from now on Coronavirus in the UK: the latest figures The prime minister said he was ""very optimistic about the opening [of shops]"", but stressed ""the most important thing is public safety and the health of our country"". He said it was difficult to tell whether there would be ""a huge wave... or a trickle"" of customers on Monday, but urged the public returning to the shops ""to observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely"". With ""fewer than 1 in 1000 cases in the population"", people had made ""a huge sacrifice...and we can't throw it away"", Mr Johnson said. By Katy Austin, business correspondent Not all shops will raise the shutters on day one: the reopening will be gradual. But for many, it's an important opportunity to welcome spending customers back in store. Having spent time and money preparing safety measures, in line with ""Covid-secure"" guidelines, shop owners are hoping the public will have the confidence to return, and that they will follow rules on queuing and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity; others expect much lower levels of trade in the coming months, compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit the number of customers in store, another is that the experience will be different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no relaxing at a cafÃ© or restaurant while most hospitality venues remain closed. The lockdown also accelerated the move towards online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be needed in future. Mr Johnson's comments echoed those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak who earlier praised retailers' ""extraordinary"" efforts to create a 'Covid-secure' environment. From Monday, most retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines. Those who fail to ensure their premises are Covid-secure could face enforcement notices. Plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins) apart - already a regular fixture in supermarkets - will be a key feature. Other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping It comes as Mr Johnson faces increased pressure to ease the 2m social distancing rule, which many ministers see as crucial to the further reopening of the economy. Mr Sunak told the BBCthe government would ""actively"" look again at the measure, given its ""enormous impact"" on the profitability of businesses. ""You are right to highlight the impact it has on business - it is the difference between maybe three-quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example, so it is important we look at it."" It is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 July - currently the earliest mooted date for the reopening of pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers in England. While other countries have enforced a lesser distance of 1m (just over 3ft),in keeping with the World Health Organization's recommendation,external,  the UK government's scientific advisers have so far maintained that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. ""Ultimately it is for ministers [to decide],"" said Mr Sunak. ""We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions."" Stores are preparing to reopen on London's Regent Street The chancellor acknowledged many people would be ""anxious"" at the prospect of going out shopping again after almost three months in lockdown. But he stressed ""it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence"". ""Shops up and down the country are desperate to welcome us all back and I think we all want to see our High Streets spring back to life again,"" he said. Steven Hall said clothing store Brother2Brother would have to innovate Designer men's clothing retailer Brother2Brother will be reopening its Reading store on Monday for the first time since March. Buying director Steven Hall said the firm ""could not wait"" to reopen, although the shopping experience might be different from what customers are used to - with staff provided with PPE and a limit of six customers at a time. In addition to ""cleaning of counters after every purchase [and] cleaning of the changing rooms after use... we will also have to quarantine the goods for at least 24 hours before they are put back into circulation"". He added that customers will be encouraged to try things on at home and return them where possible and ""pretty much everything"" will be given a sale price as the company looks to shift its seasonal stock. One way the store is attempting to drum up business is by letting customers book 30-minute slots, allowing staff to prepare a selection of items suited to their tastes. ""If we don't try to innovate and make sure business can operate at some sort of level we probably wouldn't be here for very long,"" Mr Hall said. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY,external. And Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of The British Independent Retailers Association, believes people may ""soon become weary of queuing"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for retailers, is urging the public to ""play their part"" in making shopping safer. Along with 25 other retailers, it says customers should follow five steps: Queue considerately Maintain social distancing Follow instructions inside and outside shops Follow all necessary hygiene measures Be respectful to shop staff THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Man charged over urinating at PC's memorial,"The memorial for PC Keith Palmer was unveiled outside Parliament in 2018 A man has been charged after an individual was photographed apparently urinating at the Westminster memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer. The incident is believed to have taken place on Saturday afternoon. Andrew Banks, aged 28, of Stansted, Essex has been charged with outraging public decency, the Metropolitan Police said. He will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. PC Palmer, 48, was stabbed while on duty during the Westminster terror attack on 22 March 2017. He was one of five people murdered by Khalid Masood. PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood The image of a man was widely shared on social media on Saturday as violent clashes between far-right protesters and police took place in central London. The man in the photo was widely condemned by politicians including MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying after being stabbed in the grounds of Parliament by Masood in 2017.

War of the deadlines at Brexit summit,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will talk online with EU institution leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday Psssst .. Over here! Lift the tarpaulin and dust down the jargon. Brexit is back on the political menu. Whether you voted for it or not, now is the time to start sitting up and listening again. It starts with Monday's online meeting between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU institution leaders (the president of the European Council, Commission and Parliament). I know you've seen countless ""make or break summits"", so many ""deadlines"" come and go, so many threats of ""no deal"" that came to nought. So here is an attempt to try and help navigate what's spin and what you should be looking out for. More insights - including deal-making tips from a professional hostage negotiator - in my podcasthere. First off, Brexit has, of course, ""happened"". The UK left the EU at the end of January. But we're not yet living the next chapter. The transition period we're in means that, in practical terms, little has changed. The UK is still a member of the EU's single market and customs union. The UK isn't going it alone, just yet. Johnson to hold crunch EU-UK meeting next week Who will blink first in UK-EU stand-off? The EU and UK have until the end of this month - according to the Withdrawal Agreement, aka the Brexit divorce deal - to call for an extension to transition. But the UK government has long rejected the idea. On Friday, the EU publicly accepted that UK ""no"" as definitive. So, there are six months left to negotiate, sign and seal the parameters of the UK's future relationship with its biggest and closest trade partner. That's six months left to compromise. Because without compromise - on both sides - there will be no trade deal come the end of this year. That is why it's worth keeping a closer eye on things again. The UK government promised a brighter future post-Brexit - a taking back of control over national borders, waters and immigration. The next half-a-year is when we find out if it will keep those promises. What compromises, if any, will the UK government make on its Brexit pledges in order to reach a trade deal with the EU and others? And if the UK refuses to compromise, how might having no deal at all with the EU affect our lives? Right now, EU-UK trade negotiations are at an impasse,  because of political priorities both sides of the Channel. The government rejects EU demands on competition regulations and fishing because, it says, they fail to respect the UK's post Brexit national sovereignty. The UK and EU have so far failed to agree on fishing and competition rules The EU insists without agreement on fishing and competition rules, there'll be no deal at all. It wants restrictions on the UK's ability to slash costly environmental or labour regulations for example, in order to prevent UK businesses becoming more competitive than European ones in their own market. This, says the EU, is imperative to protect the ""integrity"" of the single market and what it calls ""the European project"". But political rhetoric aside, Boris Johnson and EU leaders want a deal. It makes economic sense. This doesn't mean a deal is certain. But the UK isn't walking away from talks this month either, as it once threatened to do. Instead, after their meeting on Monday, the prime minister and the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to announce a timetable of intensified negotiations this summer, including some face-to-face meetings (Covid-19 permitting) in a declared attempt to break the deadlock. Prepare for the setting of more deadlines too. Plus dark mutterings from both sides (France's Europe minister was already at it on Thursday) should these deadlines not be met. The UK says a deal must become clear before the autumn to give businesses and workers the chance to prepare.  Spoiler alert: a deal is extremely unlikely to materialise by then. The EU insists 31 October is the latest date a deal can be reached, if it is to be ratified by the end of the year (the UK's other deadline). Spoiler alert Number 2: the late October date is also quite possibly not going to be met. The UK has so far insisted it won't extend the transition period So, does this make no-deal now the most probable outcome? Not necessarily. A deal is there to be done by December if both sides want one and if both are willing to make concessions. A compromise could be found on fishing, if, for example, EU coastal nations give up the dream of keeping the same quotas they had to fish in UK waters when the UK was an EU member. And if the UK accepts it can't have the exact same fishing agreement Brussels has with much smaller Norway. On competition rules - aka level playing-field regulations - the EU would need to give up its insistence that the UK mirror the bloc's evolving state aid rules forever in to the future. The UK concession could be to sign up to not weakening labour and environmental regulations below the current level. But that is a political decision for the UK. The EU recognises that. And it's really not sure which way the government will eventually jump. Much will depend, Brussels thinks, on whatever else is going on for Boris Johnson domestically, come the autumn. Give up some sovereignty (as trade negotiators say all deals demand, to a greater or lesser extent) and come under fire from Brexit purists, or walk away, declaring that no deal was possible with the EU, and face an outcry from many in the business community and beyond. It's at this point in off-the-record chats that my EU contacts love to repeat the phrase they've so often directed at the UK since the 2016 referendum, that ""you can't have your cake and eat it"". Or as the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier likes to say: ""You can't have the best of both worlds."" This video can not be played Brexit: Barnier on UK approach to EU trade talks Whatever the next months may bring, negotiators from both sides privately acknowledge this summer is probably too early for big compromises. The theory is that the ""other side"" would simply bank those summer compromises and demand more come the autumn. And if they're almost there but not quite, come November, the whispered wisdom in Brussels is that with all the ""clever lawyers"" in town, as they're described to me, it should be possible to find a way of fudging an extension (though for political face-saving reasons, especially in the UK, not actually calling it an extension) for a limited period beyond the end of the year, if both sides want one, and only if they are very close indeed to sealing the deal. After all my years EU-watching, I cannot imagine the bloc allowing a deal with close neighbour and ally UK to fall through over a deadline, if the UK government too were keen to keep talking. But this is not an official topic of discussion in Brussels, never mind London, at this stage. Meanwhile in Berlin, Paris, Rome and elsewhere, EU leaders are still very much focussed on Covid-19 and its fallout. Yet another reason Brussels predicts the bartering and compromise possibilities will only become clearer come October, with the clock ticking down to the end of the year.

"The football club healing the wounds of GrenfellThree years ago, 72 people lost their lives in the Grenfell fire. In its wake, a football club was born.","Joseph says football has helped him escape the trauma in ways he couldn't before Joseph John was about to get into bed in the early hours of 14 June 2017. He heard noise coming from outside the second-floor apartment he shared with his partner and 14-month-old son in the Grenfell Tower. He looked through his curtains and saw a fire engine. He then caught a bright red reflection in the window of a parked car. ""I saw the building was on fire,"" Joseph, 29, recalls. He woke his partner and rushed out of the flat to seek help. Joseph's partner is disabled and he needed help in evacuating his family from the 24-storey tower. A firefighter told him to go back inside the flat and someone would assist them in getting out. But after an hour, as flames engulfed the tower's upper floors, he and his partner realised they couldn't risk waiting any longer. Joseph passed their baby over a large gate to a stranger downstairs before carrying his partner through the window and over the gate himself. They managed to get out just in time. Seventy-two people did not. Joseph is still struggling to process the trauma he experienced. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. A few months after the fire, Joseph heard about a new local football team that had started up. A keen player, he eventually decided to check out a training session. Finally, he could take his mind off what had happened that night. ""I tried cooking, I tried working, I tried everything,"" he says. ""Nothing seemed to work for me, other than football."" Joseph wasn't the only one. This is the story of a very special Sunday league team, Grenfell Athletic. The Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, west London, was one of the worst disasters in British modern history. It began on the fourth floor of the tower just before 01:00 BST on 14 June. By 04:30 more than 100 flats were on fire. The blaze did not burn itself out for 24 hours. Rupert Taylor was born and raised on the streets surrounding Grenfell and used to play on football pitches beneath the tower. He started volunteering as a youth worker in 2005 and at the time of the fire was manager of the local youth centre. Nine children from the youth centre died in the tower. Justice4Grenfell says more than 23,000 homes in the UK are still covered in ""Grenfell-style cladding"" Rupert was on holiday in Gibraltar when he received a phone call in the early hours of 14 June. ""I turned on the news. My heart sunk, it was horrific,"" he recalls. ""We didn't know who was alive."" He got the first plane back to London and got straight to work in helping people affected by the fire. ""When I got back I drove inâ¦ the smell of burning was real,"" he says. ""I was trying to get support for the residents who were wandering the streets trying to find out about their loved ones."" A few days later, Rupert noticed a young man wandering outside the youth centre looking lost. He asked the man if he was OK and if he wanted to come in and get some supplies. He politely declined but they exchanged phone numbers. The man later came into the centre and they started to talk. He told Rupert he was a resident of the tower. ""He seemed like a very lonely chap,"" Rupert says. ""He told me that he'd lost both his parents a few years ago. A couple of weeks in, we were building a relationship and I noticed he was really struggling. I asked what helped him get through the time when he lost his parents and the first thing that came out of his mouth was 'football'. ""I said: 'Right, we're going to create a team.'"" Inside the Grenfell Athletic changing room - the team started up for the 2017-18 season Grenfell Athletic was born barely a month after the fire. Rupert started to put word around the local community and training sessions were set up. Because it was so soon after the fire, he wanted it to be as open as possible. Many were still recovering mentally and physically, and he wanted residents to feel able to pop in for training sessions without fully committing to the team. Grenfell Athletic joined the Middlesex County Football League for the 2017-18 season. The early days were turbulent. ""It was the strain of the shadow of what we were all walking out for,"" Rupert says. ""The 72 lives that were lost. Every time we went out to the pitch, we did a minute's silence. It starts to wear you down and it's quite heavy on the soul. ""Children lost their lives. You're seeing their faces when you get out on the pitch and you say you're doing this for them. You're trying to build something greater than your bog-standard Sunday league team."" Grenfell Athletic soon started to gel and finished fifth out of 12 teams in their first season - a solid start for a new team founded under such tough circumstances. At the end of the season, the team went on a tour of Italy where they played semi-professional Lanciano from the Italian fifth tier. The trip was an important part of the healing process for a lot of the players, many of whom hadn't properly left the area since the fire. It was, Rupert says, ""a time for them to be away from the shadow of this area and the tower"". Bonded after their Italian tour, the team fully found their stride in the second season. They lost just one game and won both the league - gaining promotion - and League Cup. Rupert (right) celebrating with the team's League Cup trophy last year After the fire, Joseph and his family had to spend the first few days living in a local church, before eventually being given a room in a hotel - where they stayed for a year. They have been in temporary housing since. As time went on, Joseph struggled to come to terms with the night of the fire. He knew people who lost their lives. He recalls a family he would chat to and help out in the tower's lift. They didn't make it out. ""For me, it was super difficult, even now. Every day I feel like I am living back in 2017,"" he says. Joseph, who moved to the UK four years ago, is from a family of footballers and grew up playing in his native Trinidad and Tobago - even representing his country at under-17 level. The team soon helped him escape the trauma in ways he hadn't been able to before. He also started opening up to some of his team-mates about the fire. ""It helped me grow bonds with them, it helped me be open. I can discuss anything with some of my team-mates,"" he says. ""We can chat one to one - man to man - it makes me feel comfortable. ""I don't like being around people, I don't like meeting people, I don't like being in people's space - I like to be around myself. But in football you can't have that. 'Football is my family, football is my community,"" Joseph says ""You have to be respectful, you have to be considerate to your team-mates, you have to be uplifting. It's different rules - being part of the team."" By mid-March of this year, Grenfell Athletic were joint second in the table, and then coronavirus hit. ""Right now my mental health is going down badly with no football and just staying at home,"" he said in April. ""I can't go to my physio, I can't go to my therapist. It's hard."" Many of the team did not live in Grenfell, but the tower had been a constant in their lives. Boxer Dan-Dan Keenan, 23, grew up in the area and started training at the Dale Youth Boxing Club inside Grenfell Tower aged 10. Dan-Dan was outside the tower on the night of the fire, speaking to his best friend's father, Tony, on the phone. Tony was trapped on the 23rd floor and never made it out. ""I rang him when I first got there to tell him there was a fire and he said 'thanks for making me aware but I already know,'"" Dan-Dan recalls. ""We were watching it, so it's pretty bad."" Dan-Dan soon heard about Grenfell Athletic from local friends he grew up with playing football. ""I wanted to get involved in remembrance of Grenfell and especially in remembrance of Tony. But also, besides that, I just wanted to play football,"" he says. ""It means that everyone is still talking about Grenfell, which is always a good thing. Obviously we want to remember them and not just let it get swept under the carpet."" Grenfell Athletic are now hoping to establish a permanent home in the local area While the club is still in its infancy, everyone you speak to from Grenfell Athletic is dreaming big. Rupert is eyeing up a plot of land in Greenford, west London, that could one day be the team's official home (they currently play around six miles away in Chiswick). Dan-Dan says that a home ground of their own would help build the team's profile. ""I see a lot of Sunday league clubs - YouTube teams, for example - and they've got hundreds and hundreds of people watching and supporting them,"" he says. ""If we can get a home pitch which is local to Grenfell I'm sure people - whether they like football or not - will come and support us just because we are representing Grenfell."" Joseph agrees that a real home and top-quality coaching is needed for the team to take the next step up and bag more silverware. But the importance of Grenfell Athletic goes far beyond titles and trophies for Joseph. ""I have no family here, I'm here on my own with my kids and my partner. Football is my family, football is my community,"" he says. ""They're like my brothers. Well, they are my brothers.""

Factors behind the UK George Floyd protests,"Crowds filled Trafalgar Square in London - but protests were held in many smaller towns and cities too A shocking death caught on video in the US sparked protests all over the UK and a national debate over Britain's history. But what are some of the issues in the UK which prompted so many to react so strongly to the killing of George Floyd 4,000 miles away? It was the ""absolute brutality"" of George Floyd's death and the fact that it was caught on video which mobilised people to come out and protest in the UK, says Remi Joseph-Salisbury, an academic at the University of Manchester and an organiser with the Racial Justice Network. And he says incidents are increasingly being recorded in the UK, such as the footage ofDesmond Mombeyarara being Tasered in front of his five-year-old sonin Manchester last month. Police are investigating the incident. Why US protests are so powerful this time The black British history you may not know about Black Lives Matter protests go global ""People are starting to connect the dots with what's going on in the UK,"" says Dr Joseph-Salisbury, citing the video ofrapper Wretch 32's father being Taseredat home andthe death of Simeon Francis in a Devon police cell. Police are investigating the case of Mr Francis. In the case of Wretch 32's father, police say a review had found no indication of misconduct. Official figures show that police in England and Wales werethree times more likely to arrest a black person,externalthan a white person andfive times more likely to use force,externalin 2018-19. ""The UK is not innocent"" was one of the protest's rallying cries Black people were also more thannine times as likely to be stopped and searched,external. Dr Joseph-Salisbury says it has sometimes been more difficult to mobilise UK protesters in the past. ""Britain likes to think of itself as being much less racist than the US,' he says. But, he says, abuses caught on video were a powerful motivating factor. ""There's something more grassroots and more urgent to what's happening this time."" Since 1990, there have been 1,743 people in England and Wales who have died following contact with the police, according to the charity Inquest. As a proportion of the population in these countries,black people are more than twice as likely to die in police custodyand force or restraint is more than twice as likely to be involved in their deaths. And for Ken Fero, a spokesman for the United Friends and Families Campaign, which represents those whose loved ones have died after contact with the police, there is increasing evidence that this history of deaths in custody is motivating protesters. The names of British men who died in custody such as Sean Rigg appeared alongside US victims on placards Names such asSean RiggandLeon Patterson,externalhave appeared on placards or been chanted by protesters. ""With the young people who are protesting at the moment, and it does seem to be young people, there is a stronger sense of history and consciousness than there has been in the past,"" he says. It has also been a feature of Black Lives Matter protests in the US to make the names of those who died due to police violence a focus of demonstrations and online activism, with the hashtag #saytheirnames. ""When ordinary people begin talking about it, tweeting about it, protesting about it, when celebrities start speaking about it, when people who have a voice and who are not politicians, speak out - that is what gives them some hope,"" Mr Fero says of the campaigning families. Protesters have said both of these ""deadly pandemics"" - racism and coronavirus - must be tackled together, as data has shown black Britons in England and Wales have beennearly twice as likely to diewith the disease as white people. The government's review into the impact of coronavirus on ethnic minority communities told a similar tale of social and economic inequalities with poverty, overcrowded housing, and being employed in lower-paid or key worker roles being put forward as factors for this disparity. Railway station worker Belly Mujinga has become a symbol of inequality during the pandemic People from black and ethnic minority groups have also been hit harder financially during the crisis, as research has shown they are more likely to be working in shut-down sectors or precarious jobs. Belly Mujinga, a railway ticket office clerk in London who died with coronavirus after reportedly being spat at, has become a symbol during the protests of these socio-economic divides. ""Black lives do matter. Belly's life mattered,"" placards read. More than 1.5 million people have since signed a petition calling for ""justice"" for the 47-year-old, who was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, after the British Transport Police closed her case due to insufficient evidence. As ethnic minority groups continue to bear the brunt of the labour, health and socio-economic impact of this pandemic, many will be hoping protective measures will be brought in soon. CPS asked to review Belly Mujinga's death Even before the UK had a Black Lives Matter movement, it had the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. Inspired by similar movements in South Africa, it sought to remove the statue of Oriel College's imperialist benefactor Cecil Rhodes and to reform Oxford University's curriculum to focus less on white Europeans. On Sunday, that debate about the symbols of Britain's colonial past moved from academia to the streets, when protesters pulled down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol city centre and threw it into the harbour. The action recalled similar forced removals by protesters of Confederate memorials in US states such as North Carolina and Georgia. The statue of Edward Colston was rolled through the streets on the way to the harbour Kehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, suggests the movement's success in increasing support from white people may have played a part in the removal of the Colston statue. ""If you look at who tore down the statue, it was predominantly white protesters. They can get away with things that we probably couldn't,"" he says. ""If you have a majority black protest tearing down a statue like that, I'm not sure what the response is - from the police, let alone the media."" When Black Lives Matter started in the UK in 2016, Patrick Vernon says it was a youth-led movement that was not taken very seriously by older black people. The movement, started in protest at police killings of black people in the US, came to Britain as a coalition of black activists opposing unjust policing and other forms of racism. Over the next two years, Mr Vernon says, older people changed their minds. First came the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which led to the deaths of 72 people, many of them black and Asian, amid claims of official neglect. Then the Windrush scandal emerged in 2018, with thousands of people from Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean and Africa wrongly told they were in Britain illegally. Mr Vernon, a campaigner for the Windrush victims, said people lost their homes, their jobs and were deported, having a ""traumatic effect"". ""It raises that vexed question, are we British? Are we really British? Are we valued? Is our contribution valued in this country? The whole Black Lives Matter thing crystallises that,"" he says. Black Lives Matter has become an increasingly multi-generational protest in the UK, some say This succession of issues affecting black communities has made people more willing to speak out and demonstrate, Mr Vernon suggests. ""They are now activists because they are fighting for their rights to stay in this country or for their compensation,"" he says. ""They want to take action because the current democratic process is not working for people.""

"'Much more that we need to do' on racism, says PM","There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel. There are expected to be public evidence sessions and legislation may follow. Lord Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote and the advisory chair of the government's Race Disparity Unit, said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement of the commission. However, he said it must lead to action and structural change, to tackle the inequalities in employment, health and education laid bare by the pandemic. This video can not be played Racism in the UK: 'I feel like an alien' Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said: ""We are in the midst of a global health pandemic that has sharply exposed deep structural inequalities which have long since needed urgently addressing."" She criticised some of Mr Johnson's words, after he told broadcasters he wanted to ""change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". Ms de Cordova described this as ""condescending"" and ""designed to let himself and his government off the hook"". Lord Woolley also said the phrase was ""frankly unhelpfulâ¦ unnecessary and to some hurtful"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine said the commission was a ""welcome first step"" and showed the Black Lives Matter protests were working. But she added: ""Its findings must not become simply another report on a shelf in Whitehall - the government must implement them without delay."" Meanwhile, a survey of people's attitudes to race in Britain carried out during recent protests suggests people are increasingly optimistic that the UK will become more tolerant and diverse. When asked if they were optimistic Britain would be more tolerant and diverse in 10 years' time, two thirds of people polled by Ipsos Mori said they were, up from half in 2009. And 84% of people strongly disagreed when asked if someone has to be white to be truly British - up from 55% a decade earlier. Anti-racism protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Mr Johnson said the ""serious points"" being raised by the anti-racism demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean ""wasting time"" disputing the life and opinions of ""every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone"". ""Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,"" he said. It comes as English Heritage is reviewing London's 950 blue plaques to check if any have ""problematic"" connections and will warrant extra context published about them online,as first reported in the Times.,external As for statues, English Heritage also said it believes the best course of action is to give extra context to ensure the stories of individuals are told ""without embellishment or excuses"".

'It's very exciting to return to work',"""It's very exciting, we can't wait to have our customers back,"" says Annie Martin, who manages the Waterstones Piccadilly bookshop, in London. Non-essential retailers, such as fashion, toy and book shops, will be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June - as long as they have coronavirus-related safety measures in place. Waterstones, for example, is introducing Perspex ""sneeze screens"" and a quarantine trolley where books that have been browsed will be held for ""a couple of days"". ""We want to keep bookshop experience exactly as it normally would be,"" says Annie. ""We're still encouraging people to browse, we're just looking after those books once you've browsed them."" Annie has been working on implementing those changes behind-the-scenes, but is also looking forward to seeing her colleagues back in-store. ""Bookshops are quite close teams... We've been messaging, but it's not quite the same as seeing colleagues in person for a chat, particularly about the books you've been reading on furlough."" When will shops open and what will the rules be? Special offers 'pulled from shelves during lockdown' 'Your High Street is back open for business' Suki, who works at a Boots beauty hall in London, also says that it's ""refreshing to come back to work, which is like my second home"". Most Boots stores have remained open during lockdown. That means that staff on the beauty counter have had the chance to trial different ways of working about a week before shoppers return to the High Street. Boots is removing all make-up testers, and assistants will wear plastic visors in its beauty halls, to try to keep both customers and staff safe. Suki acknowledges that some changes could make shopping more difficult. That there won't be testers is ""going to be a shock for a lot of us, because with beauty you often need to try things on,"" she said. ""The visor isn't the most glamorous thing in the world, but it does mean that I'm not touching my face and my make-up can stay on longer. And, safety isn't supposed to be glamorous,"" she adds. Overall, Suki feels as though she's in a safe pair of hands: ""We're all as nervous as each other, so I think as long as we all take the necessary steps, we'll be fine."" Shoppers, though, might be feeling more anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external One trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), is urging the public to ""play their part"" in making shopping safer. Along with 25 other retailers, it says customers should follow five steps: Queue considerately Maintain social distancing Follow instructions inside and outside shops Follow all necessary hygiene measures Be respectful to shop staff Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said: ""Every visit we make helps support jobs in retail, as well as throughout the supply chain. Retailers have been working around the clock to create a safe shopping environment"". ""Our shopping experience may be changing, but if we all follow the necessary social distancing measures and show a little consideration to those around us, then everyone will be better off."" Her plea was echoed by Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase. ""While the vast majority of our customers have adhered to the safety measures we have in store, in recent weeks, a small minority of shoppers are disobeying the guidelines set out and at times reacting abusively when challenged by store teams,"" he said. ""It's for this reason we're calling on members of the public to help us reverse the trend that saw cases of abusive incidents towards shop workers rise by 9% during the last year."" For any customers who don't want to go into a store, HMV will offer to do their shopping for them. From Monday, people can drop in a shopping list, a team member will collect it, package it up and have it waiting for the customer to pick up later. Alternatively, customers can ring their local HMV to have a product put aside for them to collect later on. The idea came from the chain's Canadian customers who have been a little bit more cautious about returning to stores as opposed to its US shoppers, says its owner Doug Putman. So what does he expect from customers in England when HMV opens 93 shops on Monday?Read more here. Many retailers in England will soon open their doors for the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown.Those in Northern Ireland have been open since Friday. John Lewis stores in Poole and Kingstonwill be the first to reopen on 15 June, followed by another 11 shops later that week. Marks & Spencer will also reopen the majority of its clothing stores. Primark has also announced that it will reopen,externalall 153 of its stores in England on Monday.

It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 of its stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted. It is still in discussions over a ""handful"" of others. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""The survival of so many retailers will hinge on the success of reopening stores over the coming weeks and the pace at which consumers return."" Mr Lim also pointed out that the ""significant shift"" towards online seen during lockdown may change shopping habits for good. ""Many of these consumers are shopping for goods online for the first time, overcoming the barriers of setting up online accounts, entering payment details and gaining trust. It is inevitable that some of these behaviours will become sticky,"" he said. Former John Lewis boss and current mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, told Sky News he hopes to see a permanent reform to business rates, a kind of council tax businesses pay. He is also keen on proposals for a digital sales tax for online retailers, ""making sure online companies pay a fair share,"" he said. For physical shops, a rare ray of sunshine from the lockdown could be customers wanting to visit local shops as they work from home and spend more time near their homes, he added. ""I do believe one of the things to come out of this is a concentration on local areas,"" he told Sky.

Which shops reopen on Monday?,"Many non-essential shops have already reopened, and now restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, outdoor gyms, and other venues will be able to join them from 4 July So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are already throwing open their doors to customers again. Shops in Northern Ireland have reopened too. Many have been announcing their plans: John Lewis isstarting by opening 13 branchesin stages Next is reopening just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams isreopening 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer is reopening all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, is reopening 145 standalone stores for click and collect TopShop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets Mobile phone operators are reopening too. Three UK is starting with 250 stores, Vodafone is opening 65 and EE is opening all its shops in England, while O2 has opened ""some"" shops River Island is opening 150 stores, with more to follow on Thursday Gap is reopening all its 81 shops in England H&M is opening ""the majority"" of its English stores DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Can my boss force me to go back to work? Shops which reopenmust meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines.,external These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2 metres (6ft) apart had become a regular fixture. But this 2m-metre rule has now been reduced to a minimum of 1m. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. What will a post-lockdown high street look like? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone,external. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. A reduction of the 2m distancing rule to what the prime minister called a ""1m-plus rule"" means many businesses in England have been given the green light to reopen from 4 July. Pubs and restaurants can start serving customers indoors, although it will be limited to table service only. Hairdressers can reopen, but staff must wear visors. Museums, hotels, cinemas, camping parks and outdoor gyms are among other areas that can also reopen provided safety measures are in place, such as distancing. But nightclubs, swimming pools, indoor gyms and casinos are among sectors that will remain closed. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping In Northern Ireland,all shops are now allowed to open. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said thatall shops can open on Monday 22 Juneas long as they havesocial distancing measuresin place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that smaller shops and outdoor marketswill be allowed to reopen from 29 June in phase twoof the country's lockdown-easing plan. Shops of all sizes will be able to open from that date as long as they have outdoor entrances and exits. Indoor shopping centres will remain closed, except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in his latest easing measures that he expects Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to continue ""responding at their own pace"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers Â£1.8bn a week in lost sales. However,there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birminghambefore their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Primark says no 'special discounts' at reopening Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Lockerin the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains.

"'Much more that we need to do' on racism, says PMBoris Johnson launches a commission to tackle all ""aspects of inequality"", including health outcomes.UK","There is ""much more that we need to do"" to tackle racism, Boris Johnson has said as he announced a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, the PM said ""no-one who cares about this country"" could ignore the anti-racist protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd. But Labour's David Lammy said it was time for action, not another review. The PM also said the UK should not attempt to ""re-write the past"" by removing historical symbols. The UK's heritage should be left ""broadly in peace"", he added. The stories behind the statues targeted in protests Protesters clash with police in central London 'We stopped somebody from being killed' Mr Johnson condemned the ""far-right thugs"" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was ""utterly absurd"" but he added that it was ""deplorable"" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words ""was a racist"" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces inquiry into racial inequality Thousands of people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrationsfollowing the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. The prime minister said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was ""no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism"". He wrote: ""There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life."" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showedmore people from ethnic minority backgrounds were ""disproportionately"" dying with the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said a number of inquiries into racial inequality had already been carried out, such ashis own reporton the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system and Theresa May'sRace Disparity Audit,external. ""You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Black people aren't playing victim as Boris indicates, they're protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now."" Mr Lammy said the announcement lacked detail because it was ""written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest"". He called for legislation and the recommendations of past reviews to be implemented. The Race Disparity Audit, published by then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, showed inequalities between ethnicities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and the courts The 2017Lammy Reviewfound evidence of bias and discrimination against people from ethnic minority backgrounds in the justice system in England and Wales Also in 2017,the McGregor-Smith Reviewof race in the workplace found people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were still disadvantaged at work and faced lower employment rates than their white counterparts Anindependent review of the Windrush scandal, published in March, found the Home Office showed ""institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race"" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the new commission would be run out of the Cabinet Office and report to the prime minister, and it would be asked to finish its work by Christmas. A chair has not yet been identified but the commission will be overseen by Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, with independent members also on the panel. There are expected to be public evidence sessions and legislation may follow. Lord Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote and the advisory chair of the government's Race Disparity Unit, said he was ""encouraged"" by the announcement of the commission. However, he said it must lead to action and structural change, to tackle the inequalities in employment, health and education laid bare by the pandemic. This video can not be played Racism in the UK: 'I feel like an alien' Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said: ""We are in the midst of a global health pandemic that has sharply exposed deep structural inequalities which have long since needed urgently addressing."" She criticised some of Mr Johnson's words, after he told broadcasters he wanted to ""change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination"". Ms de Cordova described this as ""condescending"" and ""designed to let himself and his government off the hook"". Lord Woolley also said the phrase was ""frankly unhelpfulâ¦ unnecessary and to some hurtful"". Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine said the commission was a ""welcome first step"" and showed the Black Lives Matter protests were working. But she added: ""Its findings must not become simply another report on a shelf in Whitehall - the government must implement them without delay."" Meanwhile, a survey of people's attitudes to race in Britain carried out during recent protests suggests people are increasingly optimistic that the UK will become more tolerant and diverse. When asked if they were optimistic Britain would be more tolerant and diverse in 10 years' time, two thirds of people polled by Ipsos Mori said they were, up from half in 2009. And 84% of people strongly disagreed when asked if someone has to be white to be truly British - up from 55% a decade earlier. Anti-racism protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Mr Johnson said the ""serious points"" being raised by the anti-racism demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean ""wasting time"" disputing the life and opinions of ""every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone"". ""Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,"" he said. It comes as English Heritage is reviewing London's 950 blue plaques to check if any have ""problematic"" connections and will warrant extra context published about them online,as first reported in the Times.,external As for statues, English Heritage also said it believes the best course of action is to give extra context to ensure the stories of individuals are told ""without embellishment or excuses"".

"Grylls: Scouts to learn from Baden-Powell failingsChief scout Bear Grylls says ""if he were here today we would disagree with him on many things"".Dorset","A statue of Robert Baden-Powell in Poole has been boarded up The Scout movement must learn from the ""failings"" of its founder Robert Baden-Powell, chief scout Bear Grylls says. The adventurer was speaking following a row about whether to take down a statue of Baden-Powell in Poole, Dorset. Amid claims of Baden-Powell being a supporter of Hitler, the local council initially said it would remove the statue to stop it being targeted. Grylls said of the Scouts' founder: ""We most certainly do not celebrate Baden-Powell for his failings."" In astatement,externalon the Scouts website, the TV presenter continued: ""We see them and we acknowledge them. ""And if he were here today we would disagree with him on many things, of that there is no doubt. And I suspect he would too. ""But we also recognise that Baden-Powell is part of our history, and history is nothing if we do not learn from it."" Bear Grylls said he hoped Poole's statue of Baden-Powell would remain in place He added: ""Baden-Powell may have taken the first step in creating Scouting, but the journey continues today without him. ""We know where we came from but we are not going back."" He said that he hoped Scouting statues, like the one in Poole, would remain in place ""to remind us all of one thing - the huge positive influence that Scouting continues to bring to so many young people worldwide"". There was a public outcry over the decision to remove the Baden-Powell statue temporarily, following its appearance on a target list,and it was instead boarded up. Baden-Powell had been criticised by campaigners who haveaccused him of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler- although this characterisation of himhas been rejected by his biographer. The Baden-Powell statue was ultimately not removed from Poole Quay There had been fears over the monument since Black Lives Matter protesterstore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristollast weekend. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council leader Vikki Slade said she and her 15-year-old daughter had been verbally abused after giving interviews about the monument's removal. A petition to keep it in place gained more then 40,000 signatures and protesters gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue on Thursday, with some camping overnight to ensure it was not vandalised. Council deputy leader Mark Howell said the decision to board it up temporarily was made because ""some people were suspicious the council might not put it back"". Supporters of the statue remaining in place include Tobias Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, who congratulated protesters who ""stepped forward to defend modern-day values, to defend [against] any vandalism and also - dare I say it - a rush to remove this statue without actually any debate"".

We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. Have a good evening. Nicola Sturgeon says more social interaction, the remobilisation of the NHS and a date for the reopening of the retail sector are some of the measures being considered for the next stage of the easing of the coronavirus lockdown.

Next year's exams may take place later than normal, according to Education Secretary John Swinney. He toldBBC Scotland's Politics Scotlandit was possible the timetable could be put back to allow courses to be completed. Normally the diet begins towards the end of April. This year, exams were cancelled for the first time ever. Mr Swinney accepted next year's exams could also have to be cancelled but was hopeful that would not happen. Read more. Dr Muge Cevik has studied cases from around the world The World Health Organisation said this week that coronavirus could
be transmitted by people who never develop symptoms, so may not know they are carrying the virus. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases expert at St Andrews
University, has studied a range of asymptomatic cases from contact tracing
around the world. ""What we found is that while asymptomatic patients can
certainly transmit the virus to others, they transmit the infection to fewer
cases, which means they are less contagious compared to someone with symptoms,"" she toldPolitics Scotland. Ms Cevik said transmission rates depend on many different aspects, including the duration of the contact, proximity, and the environment. She explained that 'super-spreaders' - cases when maybe 20 people are infected at the same time - occur when someone at their most infectious goes to an all-day meeting for example, or a crowded indoor event, and then might go out for dinner afterwards. ""If the same person had an evening at home, we might not see any transmission,"" she added. We still need to understand when patients are at their most infectious, but it seems to be when they start to develop symptoms or feel mildly unwell."" Dr Muge Cevik  Allow Twitter content?

The Isle of Man has become the first place in the British Isles to announce that it will drop social distancing. The rules, which apply to the general public, will be relaxed from Monday. Although 24 people have died as a result of coronavirus on the Isle of Man, there have been no new cases there for 22 days. Social distancing will remain for those working in hospitals and care homes. Gatherings will be restricted to 30 people outdoors, while people indoors will be able to invite up to two people into their homes from another household. Restaurants, gyms and schools will reopen. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 41,698, according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. If the tourism industry is able to reopen as early as 15 July, as minister Fergus Ewing this week indicated is the target, would that include overnight
stays, and tourists travelling to Scotland from outside, asks the Scotsman. Nicola Sturgeon says the government will have to assess a number of issues between now and then, but she ""would certainly hope"" that by the middle of
July, people will be able to go on holiday within Scotland. ""We very much want that 15
July date to be a real one we can meet,"" she says, but that it ""remains conditional at this stage"". ""I know how important it is to our tourist and hospitality
sector that we get them reopening and operating as quickly as possible,"" she adds. Regarding borders into Scotland, the first minister says there are regulations in place that will be reviewed on
a regular cycle, and judgements will be made based on the data and
science available. Everything we are talking about here â education, the economy, tourism â we want to get as much normality restored as quickly as possible, but that all depends on continuing to suppress this virus."" Nicola Sturgeon Asked if she has had a chance to see her family yet, Ms Sturgeon says work commitments have not allowed that so far. ""Assuming it doesnât rain later on
today I may this evening go to visit my mum and dad in their garden - socially distanced - as long as the rain doesnât start,"" she says. ""My mum is probably watching right now which means I will not get the chance to wriggle off that particular commitment."" Chris Green from the i raises a question about data on the impact of easing
lockdown on virus transmission. ""The data we have is the data we
publish every day,"" says Ms Sturgeon. ""At the moment all of that data is
going in the right direction so we do not yet see a negative impact from the
changes that were made two weeks ago. ""I wouldnât say we are at the
stage yet where we can say categorically
there has been no impact."" Prof Jason Leitch is asked what the latest scientific recommendations are in terms of children returning to school. Scotland's national clinical director says we know that:  Very few children have died globally, but there have been
some cases, Prof Leitch says. He points out that Beijing has closed its schools again as part ofa reimposition of lockdown measures, after a new outbreak
of 45 cases in a market. ""We have to be very careful not to put children at risk,"" he adds. The first minister says she hopes the UK government will avoid an ""austerity approach"" when dealing with the economic fall-out from the coronavirus crisis. In response to a question on deficit from PA, Nicola Sturgeon reminds us that it is the UK government that is doing the lion's share of borrowing, since her government's borrowing power is limited. She says the Scottish government will continue to do everything it can to mitigate the economic impact of lockdown, including getting businesses up and running again when it is safe to do so. However, she stresses the need for support and hopes the UK government will take a long-term view to recovery, while adding that she will continue to make a case for extending the current Job Retention Scheme beyond October. If the Scottish government took decisive action in spending billions of pounds to swiftly build the temporary NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, why are temporary classrooms and playgrounds not being built right now to ease the burden on schools, asks the Daily Telegraph. Nicola Sturgeon says the government will continue to support local authorities with whatever they need, but given that statutory responsibility for
education lies with them, it is only right those authorities look at the plans they want to put in place. The principles are the same however, says the first minister. ""We must be prepared to do extraordinary things to support people
through extraordinary times,"" she says. The practical issues of building a temporary hospital and providing education provision in every part of the country are not the same, she adds, but the principle of making sure children get the education they
deserve is at the heart of what they will take forward with councils. Ryan Maher of STV goes back to education and asks about the duration of the mix of home and face-to-face learning from August. âI hope it is the case that over
the next academic year we do see schools returning to normal,"" says the first minister. ""But it is not
possible for us right now from this vantage point to give dates and say that
with certainty.â  Channel 4 say they have seen a leaked letter from public health chiefs outlining a series of concerns around plans to routinely test care home staff. The first minister says the chief medical officer has replied to the letter in question and says she would not characterise it as a ""falling out"", while stressing that there are different scientific and clinical opinions on the best way to handle the crisis. Not everyone in the clinical community thinks that testing, particularly with asymptomatic people, is the right thing to do, she says, acknowledging the pressure her government has come under to increase the number of tests for care home staff. ""These things are not always clear cut - but we have to try to come to the best view to move forward,"" she says. Prof Jason Leitch is full of praise for all of Scotland's leading public health officials but again refers to a ""diversity of views"" on the virus, talking about the ""pyramid of science"" - taking lots of opinions to filter and build a strategy. The subject of education is raised by Christine Lavelle from The Sun following union calls for more money for emergency classrooms and extra staff. âThe process we are going through
right now is that local authorities are putting plans in place for the blended model of
learning that we will see from 11 August onwards,"" says the first minister. ""The Scottish government will then
look at that and we will make judgments about what additional support is going
to be necessary."" She says she wants children to return safely to schools and see ""as much normality as
quickly as possible"". The Daily Mail also asks about a possible review of the 2m distancing guidance and infection rates. The first minister says that the R number in Scotland appears to be lower than other parts of the UK as the number of cases decline. ""The lesson I take from that is that our careful, cautious plan is working, and not seek to throw it away and do something different,"" she explains. ""So let's continue down this well thought out path. The more we suppress this virus right now, the greater chance we have of reintroducing normality to our everyday lives."" Nicola Sturgeon says while transmission of the virus is much reduced, there are still a ""significant number"" of infected people in Scotland, and new cases every day. The risk remains that if we move too quickly and start coming into
closer contact with too many people, cases could multiply again quickly, says the first minister. ""While there are no risk-free options, and we shouldnât slow
down progress in pursuit of perfect, risk-free options that donât exist, equally
we must not ease restrictions at a pace that very obviously heighten the risk,"" Ms Sturgeon says. ""We should also realise the prize for going a bit more cautiously
now could be a return to greater normality in the medium term."" The first minister points out that with the R number - the rate of infection -estimated to be rising slightly in England and other countries, it is a reminder to assess and check the impact of lockdown-easing measures. Morag Kinniburgh of the BBC asks if two metre distancing will be looked at again, in light of Prime Minister Boris Johnsoncommissioning a review into the rule. ""I said last week and I will
repeat it again, that we will keep that under review,"" replies the first minister. ""We will look closely at the
case for reducing the 2m rule and the circumstances in which that might be
appropriate. If we deem it is safe to reduce that, then we will do so."" She stresses it is important not to consider any measures in isolation. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Voters wore face masks, stood 1m (3ft) apart in queues and brought their own pens and pencils to mark ballot papers. Officials were protected by plastic screens or face shields, and sprayed disinfectants on voters. Sri Lanka postponed parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for April, because of the virus. The vote is due to be held on 5 August. Sunday's trial run was held in four of the country's 22 electoral districts. It was designed to get voters used to the new system and see if extra voting time was needed.

break inside a cafe or restaurant, while hospitality venues remain closed to
sit-in customers. The lockdown also accelerated change that had already begun: A move towards more online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be
needed in future. Thousands of people formed a socially distanced human chain in Berlin today to protest against racism, while observing coronavirus guidance.

So we expect to see lower figures at weekends. Even accounting for the Sunday effect though, todayâs figure of 36 deaths in all settings across the UK is hopeful - itâs the lowest daily figure seen since before lockdown. Last Sunday, the grim toll was down to 55 and, the week before that, 111 Covid deaths were recorded. But the day before lockdown when recorded deaths were last at this level, it took under a fortnight for this figure to have increased ten-fold. The outbreak escalated with frightening speed and came down much more slowly. With further relaxations to lockdown kicking in from Monday, scientists and government will be keeping a sharp eye on these figures in the hope that another uncontrollable escalation can be prevented. As face coverings become mandatory on public transport in England from tomorrow, we've been listening to what you have to say. Christine Bithrey, from London, told us she has chronic asthma and that wearing a mask makes it feel harder for her to breathe. In a government briefing earlier this month, transport minister Grant Shapps said people with breathing difficulties would be exempt from the new law. Christine is currently working from home but she doesn't want to use public transport, because as her condition is hidden, she fears she will be attacked or stopped for not wearing a mask. ""I am terrified about the prospect of using public transport"", she says. ""A couple of weeks ago I went on a bus to a different location, and I was coughing because of my asthma. I am nearly 60.
A man appeared in front of me with a disgusting tissue and asked me to put it over my mouth."" But Christine says she will need to travel to work at some point. ""I have no idea how I am going to get to my office,"" she says.
""I spoke to some staff at Camden Road station who said they weren't even aware of any exemptions.
If London Transport Police approaches me, how can I prove I have a health condition?"" Australia's two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, have announced their latest plans to ease lockdown restrictions. NSW officials have said the 50-person limit at funerals will be lifted immediately, while nightclubs and music festivals will be allowed to operate from August if new cases of coronavirus remain low. Meanwhile in Victoria, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated customers at a time - an increase from the current limit of 20 - from 22 June. Restaurants in parts of the country, including Sydney, had already reopened earlier this month. Australia has had 7,320 confirmed cases, and a total death toll of 102. There's a festive atmosphere at London Zoo ahead of its reopening tomorrow, and the gorillas have had bunting put up in their treehouses as they prepare to greet fans once again. The zoo closed in March when the UK went into lockdown. When it reopens on Monday, there'll be limits on visitor numbers, one-way routes, and paw-print-shaped social distancing markers. Daniel Simmonds, team leader of the zoo's primates, told Reuters news agency the gorillas ""have already adjusted to the fact that people haven't been coming in, but equally I am absolutely sure they are going to be really excited when they see lots of friendly visitor faces visiting them tomorrow"". Almost 11,000 Germans will be arriving in Spain's Balearic islands next week as part of a scheme helping to boost the tourism industry after it was ground to a halt by the coronavirus pandemic. They will start landing on Monday and most will stay on the largest island, Mallorca. However a smaller number will head to Ibiza and Menorca. So who are the lucky ones? Spanish news outlet El Mundo has declared them ""false tourists"", as they are industry professionals, such as travel agents and hotel owners, rather than random holidaymakers. Their trip is a test run, so others can hopefully follow in their footsteps. The visitors will be exempt from virus testing and mandatory two-week quarantines, which are in force across mainland Spain. But they will have to fill out a form, have their temperatures taken on arrival, and provide authorities with their contact details and accommodation addresses so they can be traced if necessary. Tourism is a vital industry for the islands, accounting for approximately a third of the region's economy. But unlike their German counterparts, Spaniards are still prohibited from visiting anywhere but their home regions. Spain was initially set to reopen its borders to other EU countries from 1 July. But this weekend Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said this will be moved to a week earlier. The 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas travellers to Spain will also expire on 21 June. The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan could more than double by the end of this month and peak at 1.2 million a month later, the country's planning minister Asad Umar has warned. Pakistan currently has almost 140,000 confirmed cases and its death toll is more than 2,600. However, because testing remains limited, it's thought that the real numbers are higher. ""Expert estimates say the number of confirmed cases could go up to 300,000 by the end of June if we keep on flouting SOPs [standard operating procedures] and taking the problem lightly,"" said Umar. He issued the warning as people reportedly ignore guidance on social distancing and hygiene measures to stem the spread of the virus. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon hopes to allow more social interaction this week Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she remains optimistic that she will be able to announce to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the country is ready to move into phase two of easing lockdown measures, and that people in the ""shielded"" group will be able to go outdoors for exercise. The first minister said at today's briefing that she may announce a partial move, rather than a complete move to phase two. She said this could allow more social interaction, the re-mobilisation of the NHS, and would indicate when the retail sector might reopen. The first minister also stressed the importance of social distancing, and said the two-metre rule would remain under review, but would only be reduced if it was deemed safe to do so. Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was killed recently As some coronavirus restrictions have been eased in South Africa there has been a surge in violence against women, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. He called it a ""dark and shameful week"" for his country. Several women have been killed, including Tshegofatso Pule - who was eight months pregnant when she was found stabbed and hanging from a tree. Among the restrictions that have been lifted recently are a ban on the sale of alcohol. ""Gender-based violence thrives in a climate of silence. With our silence, by looking the other way because we believe it is a personal or family matter, we become complicit in this most insidious of crimes,"" the president said. Read the full storyhere. Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line withnew World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport. Elsewhere in the UK:  Read more here  The Visual and Data Journalism Team As we reported earlier, the UK today saw its lowest rise in the number of people who died after testing positive for coronavirus (36) since 22 March, though figures tend to be lower at the weekend due to reporting delays. Here's a look at how the UK's outbreak is changing, in charts. Next week US President Donald Trump is planning to hold an election rally in the US city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. But Tulsa's public health director, Bruce Dart, says he is concerned about the risks it poses due to the national outbreak of coronavirus. âI think itâs an honour for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,â Dr Dart told local outlet Tulsa World. Oklahoma and Tulsa County reported a record increase in infections on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. As of Saturday, more than 8,000 cases and 359 deaths have been confirmed across the state. âCovid is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,â Dr Dart said. âI wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isnât as large a concern as it is today. âIâm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and Iâm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well,â he added. A 70-year-old man who nearly died of coronavirus has reportedly been handed a $1.1m (Â£876,000) medical bill in the US. The Seattle Times reported that Michael Flor racked up the bill after needing 62 days of hospital treatment. Flor was so seriously ill that at one point nurses held up a phone for him so he could say goodbye to his wife and children. The 181-page bill totalled $1,122,501.04. However, Flor shouldn't have to dig into his own pockets as he is covered by Medicare, a government insurance program for the elderly. ""It was a million bucks to save my life, and of course I'd say that's money well-spent ... But I also know I might be the only one saying that,"" he told the Times. Ione WellsBBC News Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown For people living alone the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. In England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household- but that's not the case in Wales. Jan Maddox, 71, is from Newport in south Wales but her partner lives in the Midlands. She is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog,"" she says. ""I did have a terrific social life. I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Read more. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the
total number of deaths to 41,698,
according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest
daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures
tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Gatwick drone arrest couple receive Â£200k payout,"Paul and Elaine Gait said at the time they felt ""violated"" by Sussex Police A police force has paid out Â£200,000 over the arrest of a couple falsely accused of causing chaos at Gatwick Airport with a drone. Armed officers stormed the home of Paul and Elaine Gait in December 2018, and held them for 36 hours after drones caused the airport to close repeatedly. The couple were released without charge, and sued Sussex Police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. The Gait's legal team said the force had agreed an out-of-court settlement. Airport chiefs said 120,000 people due to arrive or fly had not been able to travel Sussex Police confirmed it has paid the couple the Â£55,000 owed in damages, and law firm Howard Kennedy said it has billed the force an additional Â£145,000 in legal costs. Flights were cancelled in droves over a three-day period, as police investigated multiple reported drone sightings. No-one has ever been charged, and police have said that some reported drone sightings may have been Sussex Police's own craft. Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress Drone arrest couple 'feel violated' How can a drone cause so much chaos? Twelve armed officers swooped on Mr and Mrs Gait's home, even though they did not possess any drones and had been at work during the reported sightings. In a statement released by their legal team on Sunday, the couple said: ""We are delighted to have finally received vindication, it has been a very long fight for justice. ""It has taken lengthy legal proceedings to obtain resolution from the police and to finally have closure on this distressing time."" Anti-drone equipment was used at Gatwick Airport after the drone stopped flights intermittently for days In a letter to the couple, Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable David Miller said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""unpleasantness"" the couple experienced, and acknowledged it would have been ""traumatic"". He added: ""Unfortunately, when the police carry out their functions on behalf of the public, sometimes innocent people are arrested as part of necessary police investigations in the public interest. ""However, we recognise that things could have been done differently and, as a result, Sussex Police have agreed to pay you compensation and legal costs."" The force commissioned a ""thorough independent review"" of the drone incident last year. It revealed96 people ""of interest"" were identified, researched and ruled outduring the investigation and the cost of the operation and subsequent investigation was Â£790,000.

"Call for Â£250m coronavirus recovery fundThe money is needed to help worst-hit towns, say the Welsh Conservatives.Wales politics","Many of Wales' poorest areas have been hardest hit by the pandemic A coronavirus community recovery fund worth Â£250m should be set up to support the hardest-hit communities, the Welsh Conservatives have said. The party's group leader in the Welsh Parliament said it would help address a ""public economic crisis"". Paul Davies said business rates could be scrapped for certain businesses in the worst-affected towns. He said the money was already available, but Welsh Labour has questioned the figures. The Conservatives' policy announcement follows the publication of a report that claimeda number of Welsh towns were among the most vulnerable across the UK. Under the party's plans, a Â£250m fund would be established for the term of the next Welsh Parliament to support the worst-affected communities. The Conservatives said it would allow the establishment of ""business rate-free zones"" where business rates would be scrapped for all businesses for three years. Beyond those zones, the party wants to scrap business rates for businesses with a rateable value of up to Â£15,000. Currently, businesses with a rateable value of less than Â£6,000 are exempt from paying rates and the amount payable is tapered for those valued between Â£6,000 and Â£12,000. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We are going through not only a public health crisis, but we're also going through a public economic crisis,"" Mr Davies told the BBC'sPolitics Wales. ""And that's why it's absolutely crucial now as we come out of this pandemic that we support the communities which will be hardest-hit by this pandemic."" Mr Davies said the business rates relief scheme would ""support those existing businesses in those communities, but also attract new businesses"". He claimed there was enough money in the Welsh Government's coffers to pay for the scheme as a result of UK government spending on the pandemic in England. But a Welsh Labour spokesman said that was not the case: ""The Welsh Conservatives seem not to understand that there are strict limits in the extent to which we can carry forward funds from one year to the next, with our maximum reserve being Â£350m. ""Small businesses with premises with a rateable value of less than Â£12,000 already get small business rate relief. ""While extending this further would be desirable, we would only be able to consider doing so if the Conservative government at Westminster were to provide a significantly more generous financial settlement."" Plaid Cymru's recovery plan includes guaranteeing a job for every unemployed 18-24 year old in Wales and setting up a ""renewal fund"" to ""transform sectors identified as being hit hardest by Covid-19"".

But this weekend Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said this will be moved to a week earlier. The 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas travellers to Spain will also expire on 21 June. The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan could more than double by the end of this month and peak at 1.2 million a month later, the country's planning minister Asad Umar has warned. Pakistan currently has almost 140,000 confirmed cases and its death toll is more than 2,600. However, because testing remains limited, it's thought that the real numbers are higher. ""Expert estimates say the number of confirmed cases could go up to 300,000 by the end of June if we keep on flouting SOPs [standard operating procedures] and taking the problem lightly,"" said Umar. He issued the warning as people reportedly ignore guidance on social distancing and hygiene measures to stem the spread of the virus. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon hopes to allow more social interaction this week Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she remains optimistic that she will be able to announce to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the country is ready to move into phase two of easing lockdown measures, and that people in the ""shielded"" group will be able to go outdoors for exercise. The first minister said at today's briefing that she may announce a partial move, rather than a complete move to phase two. She said this could allow more social interaction, the re-mobilisation of the NHS, and would indicate when the retail sector might reopen. The first minister also stressed the importance of social distancing, and said the two-metre rule would remain under review, but would only be reduced if it was deemed safe to do so. Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was killed recently As some coronavirus restrictions have been eased in South Africa there has been a surge in violence against women, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. He called it a ""dark and shameful week"" for his country. Several women have been killed, including Tshegofatso Pule - who was eight months pregnant when she was found stabbed and hanging from a tree. Among the restrictions that have been lifted recently are a ban on the sale of alcohol. ""Gender-based violence thrives in a climate of silence. With our silence, by looking the other way because we believe it is a personal or family matter, we become complicit in this most insidious of crimes,"" the president said. Read the full storyhere. Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line withnew World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport. Elsewhere in the UK:  Read more here  The Visual and Data Journalism Team As we reported earlier, the UK today saw its lowest rise in the number of people who died after testing positive for coronavirus (36) since 22 March, though figures tend to be lower at the weekend due to reporting delays. Here's a look at how the UK's outbreak is changing, in charts. Next week US President Donald Trump is planning to hold an election rally in the US city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. But Tulsa's public health director, Bruce Dart, says he is concerned about the risks it poses due to the national outbreak of coronavirus. âI think itâs an honour for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,â Dr Dart told local outlet Tulsa World. Oklahoma and Tulsa County reported a record increase in infections on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. As of Saturday, more than 8,000 cases and 359 deaths have been confirmed across the state. âCovid is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,â Dr Dart said. âI wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isnât as large a concern as it is today. âIâm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and Iâm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well,â he added. A 70-year-old man who nearly died of coronavirus has reportedly been handed a $1.1m (Â£876,000) medical bill in the US. The Seattle Times reported that Michael Flor racked up the bill after needing 62 days of hospital treatment. Flor was so seriously ill that at one point nurses held up a phone for him so he could say goodbye to his wife and children. The 181-page bill totalled $1,122,501.04. However, Flor shouldn't have to dig into his own pockets as he is covered by Medicare, a government insurance program for the elderly. ""It was a million bucks to save my life, and of course I'd say that's money well-spent ... But I also know I might be the only one saying that,"" he told the Times. Ione WellsBBC News Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown For people living alone the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. In England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household- but that's not the case in Wales. Jan Maddox, 71, is from Newport in south Wales but her partner lives in the Midlands. She is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog,"" she says. ""I did have a terrific social life. I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Read more. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the
total number of deaths to 41,698,
according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest
daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures
tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Our colleagues in Singapore will be resuming live coverage at 0500 BST on Monday. Authorities in Sri Lanka have held mock elections as part of a test of new anti-coronavirus voting measures. Voters wore face masks, stood 1m (3ft) apart in queues and brought their own pens and pencils to mark ballot papers. Officials were protected by plastic screens or face shields, and sprayed disinfectants on voters. Sri Lanka postponed parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for April, because of the virus. The vote is due to be held on 5 August. Sunday's trial run was held in four of the country's 22 electoral districts. It was designed to get voters used to the new system and see if extra voting time was needed. Read more here The Indian government has called an urgent meeting of the leaders of the country's main political parties to discuss the coronavirus crisis in Delhi. The meeting, which will be held tomorrow, comes after India reported almost 12,000 new cases in 24 hours. Delhi's hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, with reports of people dying after being repeatedly turned away from different hospitals. It's estimated the health system will need tens of thousands more beds in the coming weeks in order to deal with the virus, which hasn't yet peaked. About 500 railway carriages are going to be converted into Covid wards. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Indian hospitals struggle to cope with the outbreak Katy AustinBusiness Correspondent From Monday, all non-essential retailers will be allowed to reopen in England. But not all shops will raise the shutters on day one - the
reopening will be gradual. For many, itâs an important opportunity to
welcome customers back to spend in store. Having spent time and money preparing
safety measures in line with âCovid-secureâ guidelines, they are hoping
shoppers have the confidence to return, and that they follow rules on queuing
and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity. However, businesses
Iâve spoken to expect much lower levels of trade overall in the coming months,
compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit
the number of customers in store - another is that the experience will be
different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no taking a
break inside a cafe or restaurant, while hospitality venues remain closed to
sit-in customers. The lockdown also accelerated change that had already begun: A move towards more online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be
needed in future. Thousands of people formed a socially distanced human chain in Berlin today to protest against racism, while observing coronavirus guidance. The chain stretched from the Brandenburg Gate, past the old East Berlin television tower, and into NeukÃ¶lln district. Political parties, climate change campaigners and other activist groups - including Grannies Against the Far Right - took part in protest events in several German cities. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. You are likely to see them in other shops too, such as bookseller Waterstones and Boots, the UK's biggest pharmacy chain. Some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - will be in place to try to reduce the virus spread. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones says it will ""quarantine"" books for 72 hours after people have touched them. The number of customers allowed in stores will also be limited, and businesses have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,external. But despite these precautions, many shoppers are feeling anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The daily coronavirus death toll reported by the government tells you how many deaths were recorded that day - not how many actually happened. So we expect to see lower figures at weekends. Even accounting for the Sunday effect though, todayâs figure of 36 deaths in all settings across the UK is hopeful - itâs the lowest daily figure seen since before lockdown. Last Sunday, the grim toll was down to 55 and, the week before that, 111 Covid deaths were recorded. But the day before lockdown when recorded deaths were last at this level, it took under a fortnight for this figure to have increased ten-fold. The outbreak escalated with frightening speed and came down much more slowly. With further relaxations to lockdown kicking in from Monday, scientists and government will be keeping a sharp eye on these figures in the hope that another uncontrollable escalation can be prevented. As face coverings become mandatory on public transport in England from tomorrow, we've been listening to what you have to say. Christine Bithrey, from London, told us she has chronic asthma and that wearing a mask makes it feel harder for her to breathe. In a government briefing earlier this month, transport minister Grant Shapps said people with breathing difficulties would be exempt from the new law. Christine is currently working from home but she doesn't want to use public transport, because as her condition is hidden, she fears she will be attacked or stopped for not wearing a mask. ""I am terrified about the prospect of using public transport"", she says. ""A couple of weeks ago I went on a bus to a different location, and I was coughing because of my asthma. I am nearly 60.
A man appeared in front of me with a disgusting tissue and asked me to put it over my mouth."" But Christine says she will need to travel to work at some point. ""I have no idea how I am going to get to my office,"" she says.
""I spoke to some staff at Camden Road station who said they weren't even aware of any exemptions.
If London Transport Police approaches me, how can I prove I have a health condition?"" Australia's two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, have announced their latest plans to ease lockdown restrictions. NSW officials have said the 50-person limit at funerals will be lifted immediately, while nightclubs and music festivals will be allowed to operate from August if new cases of coronavirus remain low. Meanwhile in Victoria, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated customers at a time - an increase from the current limit of 20 - from 22 June. Restaurants in parts of the country, including Sydney, had already reopened earlier this month. Australia has had 7,320 confirmed cases, and a total death toll of 102. There's a festive atmosphere at London Zoo ahead of its reopening tomorrow, and the gorillas have had bunting put up in their treehouses as they prepare to greet fans once again. The zoo closed in March when the UK went into lockdown. When it reopens on Monday, there'll be limits on visitor numbers, one-way routes, and paw-print-shaped social distancing markers. Daniel Simmonds, team leader of the zoo's primates, told Reuters news agency the gorillas ""have already adjusted to the fact that people haven't been coming in, but equally I am absolutely sure they are going to be really excited when they see lots of friendly visitor faces visiting them tomorrow"". Almost 11,000 Germans will be arriving in Spain's Balearic islands next week as part of a scheme helping to boost the tourism industry after it was ground to a halt by the coronavirus pandemic. They will start landing on Monday and most will stay on the largest island, Mallorca. However a smaller number will head to Ibiza and Menorca. So who are the lucky ones? Spanish news outlet El Mundo has declared them ""false tourists"", as they are industry professionals, such as travel agents and hotel owners, rather than random holidaymakers. Their trip is a test run, so others can hopefully follow in their footsteps. The visitors will be exempt from virus testing and mandatory two-week quarantines, which are in force across mainland Spain. But they will have to fill out a form, have their temperatures taken on arrival, and provide authorities with their contact details and accommodation addresses so they can be traced if necessary. Tourism is a vital industry for the islands, accounting for approximately a third of the region's economy. But unlike their German counterparts, Spaniards are still prohibited from visiting anywhere but their home regions. Spain was initially set to reopen its borders to other EU countries from 1 July. But this weekend Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said this will be moved to a week earlier. The 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas travellers to Spain will also expire on 21 June. The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan could more than double by the end of this month and peak at 1.2 million a month later, the country's planning minister Asad Umar has warned.

Grylls: Scouts to learn from Baden-Powell failings,"A statue of Robert Baden-Powell in Poole has been boarded up The Scout movement must learn from the ""failings"" of its founder Robert Baden-Powell, chief scout Bear Grylls says. The adventurer was speaking following a row about whether to take down a statue of Baden-Powell in Poole, Dorset. Amid claims of Baden-Powell being a supporter of Hitler, the local council initially said it would remove the statue to stop it being targeted. Grylls said of the Scouts' founder: ""We most certainly do not celebrate Baden-Powell for his failings."" In astatement,externalon the Scouts website, the TV presenter continued: ""We see them and we acknowledge them. ""And if he were here today we would disagree with him on many things, of that there is no doubt. And I suspect he would too. ""But we also recognise that Baden-Powell is part of our history, and history is nothing if we do not learn from it."" Bear Grylls said he hoped Poole's statue of Baden-Powell would remain in place He added: ""Baden-Powell may have taken the first step in creating Scouting, but the journey continues today without him. ""We know where we came from but we are not going back."" He said that he hoped Scouting statues, like the one in Poole, would remain in place ""to remind us all of one thing - the huge positive influence that Scouting continues to bring to so many young people worldwide"". There was a public outcry over the decision to remove the Baden-Powell statue temporarily, following its appearance on a target list,and it was instead boarded up. Baden-Powell had been criticised by campaigners who haveaccused him of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler- although this characterisation of himhas been rejected by his biographer. The Baden-Powell statue was ultimately not removed from Poole Quay There had been fears over the monument since Black Lives Matter protesterstore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristollast weekend. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council leader Vikki Slade said she and her 15-year-old daughter had been verbally abused after giving interviews about the monument's removal. A petition to keep it in place gained more then 40,000 signatures and protesters gathered at the quayside to show support for the statue on Thursday, with some camping overnight to ensure it was not vandalised. Council deputy leader Mark Howell said the decision to board it up temporarily was made because ""some people were suspicious the council might not put it back"". Supporters of the statue remaining in place include Tobias Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, who congratulated protesters who ""stepped forward to defend modern-day values, to defend [against] any vandalism and also - dare I say it - a rush to remove this statue without actually any debate"".

India to use train carriages as coronavirus wards,"Train carriages at New Delhi station India is to convert another 500 railway carriages to create 8,000 more beds for coronavirus patients in Delhi, amid a surge in infections. Home Minister Amit Shah announced a package of new emergency measures for the capital, including a rapid increase in testing for Covid-19. Nursing homes will also be requisitioned. He met Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to address the crisis. India's daily number of confirmed new cases has reached almost 12,000. The total number of 320,922 officially confirmed cases puts India fourth in the world - after the US, Brazil and Russia - in the pandemic. The death toll in India stands at 9,195, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University from official sources. The Hindustan Times reports that Delhi is the third worst-hit state in India after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. It reports that Delhi's bed capacity across private and government hospitals for Covid-19 patients stands at 9,698, of which 4,248 beds are vacant.

"Woman hatches ducks from Waitrose eggsBeep, Peep and Meep started life on a supermarket shelf but will now live with Charli Lello's chickens.","Beep, Peep and Meep are Braddock White ducklings A woman has hatched three ducklings called Beep, Peep and Meep from eggs she bought in Waitrose. Charli Lello, 29, from Hertfordshire, put the Clarence Court eggs in an incubator as an experiment to pass the time after being furloughed. She said the ducklings would live ""a very happy life"" with her pet chickens. A Waitrose spokesman said fertilised eggs were safe to eat and ""entirely indistinguishable"" from normal eggs, unless incubated. Charli Lello hatched the ducklings as an experiment to pass the time while furloughed from work Ms Lello, who normally works as an assistant manager in a shop, got the idea after seeing a video on Facebook of someone hatching quail eggs from a supermarket. ""While I was in Waitrose, I saw the duck eggs and thought maybe they would work as well. I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs.

"Gatwick drone arrest couple receive Â£200k payoutPaul and Elaine Gait say they are ""delighted to be vindicated"" after a long fight for justice.Sussex","Paul and Elaine Gait said at the time they felt ""violated"" by Sussex Police A police force has paid out Â£200,000 over the arrest of a couple falsely accused of causing chaos at Gatwick Airport with a drone. Armed officers stormed the home of Paul and Elaine Gait in December 2018, and held them for 36 hours after drones caused the airport to close repeatedly. The couple were released without charge, and sued Sussex Police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. The Gait's legal team said the force had agreed an out-of-court settlement. Airport chiefs said 120,000 people due to arrive or fly had not been able to travel Sussex Police confirmed it has paid the couple the Â£55,000 owed in damages, and law firm Howard Kennedy said it has billed the force an additional Â£145,000 in legal costs. Flights were cancelled in droves over a three-day period, as police investigated multiple reported drone sightings. No-one has ever been charged, and police have said that some reported drone sightings may have been Sussex Police's own craft. Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress Drone arrest couple 'feel violated' How can a drone cause so much chaos? Twelve armed officers swooped on Mr and Mrs Gait's home, even though they did not possess any drones and had been at work during the reported sightings. In a statement released by their legal team on Sunday, the couple said: ""We are delighted to have finally received vindication, it has been a very long fight for justice. ""It has taken lengthy legal proceedings to obtain resolution from the police and to finally have closure on this distressing time."" Anti-drone equipment was used at Gatwick Airport after the drone stopped flights intermittently for days In a letter to the couple, Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable David Miller said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""unpleasantness"" the couple experienced, and acknowledged it would have been ""traumatic"". He added: ""Unfortunately, when the police carry out their functions on behalf of the public, sometimes innocent people are arrested as part of necessary police investigations in the public interest. ""However, we recognise that things could have been done differently and, as a result, Sussex Police have agreed to pay you compensation and legal costs."" The force commissioned a ""thorough independent review"" of the drone incident last year. It revealed96 people ""of interest"" were identified, researched and ruled outduring the investigation and the cost of the operation and subsequent investigation was Â£790,000.

Secondary schools get ready to welcome back pupilsA secondary head describes her plans to bring pupils back to school and keep the virus at bay.Family & Education,"'Safety measures are key', says Rachel Hutchinson, principal of Ivybridge Community College As some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils in England prepare to go back to school on Monday, secondary head teachers are having to overcome an array of challenges. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements will vary widely. More than 300 schools and colleges told us they were mainly offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Some are making the return gradual, starting with pupils who are struggling the most, with many providing individual pastoral sessions to check on mental health. The Sixth Form Colleges Association says schools and colleges should ensure that extending face-to-face teaching does not impact on support for pupils who are still at home. Heads mount 'military operations' for exam pupils When will secondary schools go back? At Ivybridge Community College on the southern slopes of Dartmoor in Devon, principal Rachel Hutchinson has been putting the final touches to plans for welcoming back just over a quarter of the college's 2,500 students. The Year 10 and 12 pupils who will be doing their GCSEs and A-levels next year will return to a very different school from the one they last saw in March. ""Safety measures are key,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. ""We're working very much with social distancing measures... looking very much at the timetable and what we can do safely and sensibly."" But she's also determined to give them an ""effective education"". Pupils arrive by school bus, public bus and train, some are dropped off, while others walk or cycle. New mask-wearing and social distancing rules on public transport, plus a ban on sixth-formers car sharing, mean clear communication is key, she says. Each school bus can now carry just seven students, which means that, while bringing back a quarter of the pupils is feasible, larger numbers might be impossible, she says. At Ivybridge, even these smaller numbers of students will have to be part-time to ensure safety. It means only about 100 will be in at any one time, with only 10 in each class. For Year 10s, there will be one full day of teaching each week, with 90 minutes each of maths, English and science. The other subjects will continue to be taught remotely on the days pupils are at home. ""They'll still get their full curriculum,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Social distancing rules mean there can only be about 10 pupils in each classroom The post-16 students will have seminar days to reduce movement around the site. They'll get two full days of each A-level over the five weeks before the end of term, says Mrs Hutchinson. ""We think it's very viable, its do-able and it's really important for their education."" There are 2m distancing markers along all the corridors and a one-way system. Staff in high-vis jackets will monitor every entrance, there are hand-sanitising stations and lots of posters and banners to remind children not to crowd each other. ""It's going to be that supermarket feel - when you go to a supermarket for the first time with the trolley queues,"" she says. With reduced numbers, it's manageable, she says, but increased numbers of students would present a challenge. Social distancing plans are in place for break times too ""I'd like to think as a college we've been really strong on our pastoral care,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Tutors have had lots of email contact with students, with fun, remote activities like cake-baking to keep pupils engaged with the school community. However, she recognises some will have fallen behind and so there is a recovery programme to help them catch up. She says a key aim of returning to school is to ensure pupils' wellbeing and she will keep a particular eye out for socially disadvantaged children. About 30 children have opted to take up the college's offer of one-to-one tutoring, with support available for families who have suffered bereavement or illness or are anxious, she says. The college has run reopening induction sessions for staff One of the most important aspects is ""getting it right for my staff"", she says. ""They are absolutely working round the clock to maintain communication, the pastoral welfare and wellbeing of the children, as well as checking in on the learning."" Some have their own health issues, many will be running busy households without childcare and may feel anxious about returning to face-to-face teaching. ""It's managing staff welfare and making sure that staff feel safe and are ready to come back to work,"" she says. Years 7, 8 and 9 will continue to be taught virtually and pupils in Years 11 and 13, whose exams were cancelled will still get support. ""It's keeping an eye on a number of schools really; our virtual school as well as the new school that's going to be returning. ""The exciting thing is, for the first time ever, children are saying they miss school,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Getting the college back to a ""new normal for September,"" is another challenge. It will be welcoming the new Year 7s, plus a huge group who have not been in school since March. Mrs Hutchinson says that unless the distancing measures are amended, schools will have to run a blend of classroom lessons and virtual learning in September. She believes the idea of schools opening over the summer, when staff have already been flat out since March is ""quite controversial"". ""The summer six weeks are going to be key for us to get ready for September,"" she argues - and many staff will have to work through to prepare. ""So to open for children in as well will be incredibly challenging,"" she says. She hopes both children and teachers can take their normal summer holidays, ready for a new start, whatever form it will take. Wales will begin opening schools on 29 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland waiting until August.

Are Scotland's care homes able to care?,"Private care homes are getting some of the heat for the spread of coronavirus and high numbers of residents' deaths. That has led to claims they should be in public hands, and that they are raking off excess profits. There are examples of that. But the wider problem seems to have more to do with under-funding than profiteering. Indeed, private care homes in Britain are struggling with unsustainably low levels of government-paid fees. The shortfall is reckoned to be around Â£1bn, and much of that is made up with excess fees, paid by older and vulnerable residents, required to draw on often modest savings. That was the finding of the Competition and Markets Authority, when it took a close look at the private care home sector in 2017. It was trying to find out if the market operated in the interests of those who have to use the homes. The answer: not sufficiently. At the point of choosing a home, people are often in a weak position to choose or negotiate. But the other main finding was that local government is failing to pay sufficient fees to make the sector sustainable. It needs more to pay for repairs and maintenance, and to attract new investors, when demographic change points to the need for a big rise in capacity. Care homes: Questions and Answers Those that are building new care homes are doing so in affluent areas, where they can attract wealthier ""self-funders"", the CMA found. In Scotland, a self-funder is someone who has to pay their way, after getting the standard government grants for nursing and personal care - if they're assessed as needing them. With care home fees for private individuals costing more than Â£900 per week on average, that's Â£200 more than the nationally negotiated set rate for council-funded residents. Residential care home beds (2017): 32,799 in total Long-stay: 31,223 Private sector: 26,053 Council/NHS: 3606 Voluntary: 3032 Long stay residents with dementia: 62% Average length of residency: 1.5 years. Discharges from care homes: 85% due to the resident dying 7% move care home 5% leave for hospital 1% go back to their own homes. Local authority rates for 2020-21: Nursing home: Â£740 per week Residential home: Â£635 *Sources: ISD census: Scottish Care: Competition and Markets Authority The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) tells care homes what it thinks is reasonable to pay. It assumes the minimum level of staffing, and a minimum Â£9.30 per hour for care assistants, though the maximum isn't much more. Scottish Care, which represents most private care homes, says the National Care Contract assumes a lower level of nurse pay than equivalent work in the NHS. There's heating, and less than Â£6 a day for food. A 4% margin is allowed for profit. For a nursing home resident, that comes to a weekly Â£740 this year. Care Scotland says the true price should be Â£950 to Â£1000. But it's not in a strong negotiating position. In England, each council negotiates its own rates, leaving a much less clear picture. The rates for private individuals in England can be up to a third higher than the council rate. An alternative analysis of the private care home sector, by the GMB trade union, found that care homes can be far too profitable, and that some people have become very rich. Ownership is hard to pin down, through complex corporate vehicles, these ""private equity"" owners are hard to determine, sometimes because their profits go to tax havens. That union research suggests the bumper profits are made from property rather than running the service. But the GMB argues that it has a direct effect on the low pay and poor employment conditions of care home workers. The private equity ownership model accounts for fewer than a fifth of Scottish care homes.

It comes as a further 36 deaths from coronavirus were announced in the past 24 hours. It brings the UK death toll - across all settings - to 41,698. The latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 March, but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend, because of a reporting lag. While food shops and pharmacies, as well as other essential retailers including banks and petrol stations, have been open throughout lockdown, non-essential stores, such as book shops and fashion outlets, have been shuttered since 23 March. Coronavirus lockdown: All shops can open on Monday in England Coronavirus: What shops will open next? Five ways shopping will be different from now on Coronavirus in the UK: the latest figures The prime minister said he was ""very optimistic about the opening [of shops]"", but stressed ""the most important thing is public safety and the health of our country"". He said it was difficult to tell whether there would be ""a huge wave... or a trickle"" of customers on Monday, but urged the public returning to the shops ""to observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely"". With ""fewer than 1 in 1000 cases in the population"", people had made ""a huge sacrifice...and we can't throw it away"", Mr Johnson said. By Katy Austin, business correspondent Not all shops will raise the shutters on day one: the reopening will be gradual. But for many, it's an important opportunity to welcome spending customers back in store. Having spent time and money preparing safety measures, in line with ""Covid-secure"" guidelines, shop owners are hoping the public will have the confidence to return, and that they will follow rules on queuing and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity; others expect much lower levels of trade in the coming months, compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit the number of customers in store, another is that the experience will be different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no relaxing at a cafÃ© or restaurant while most hospitality venues remain closed. The lockdown also accelerated the move towards online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be needed in future. Mr Johnson's comments echoed those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak who earlier praised retailers' ""extraordinary"" efforts to create a 'Covid-secure' environment. From Monday, most retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines. Those who fail to ensure their premises are Covid-secure could face enforcement notices. Plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins) apart - already a regular fixture in supermarkets - will be a key feature. Other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping It comes as Mr Johnson faces increased pressure to ease the 2m social distancing rule, which many ministers see as crucial to the further reopening of the economy. Mr Sunak told the BBCthe government would ""actively"" look again at the measure, given its ""enormous impact"" on the profitability of businesses. ""You are right to highlight the impact it has on business - it is the difference between maybe three-quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example, so it is important we look at it."" It is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 July - currently the earliest mooted date for the reopening of pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers in England. While other countries have enforced a lesser distance of 1m (just over 3ft),in keeping with the World Health Organization's recommendation,external,  the UK government's scientific advisers have so far maintained that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. ""Ultimately it is for ministers [to decide],"" said Mr Sunak. ""We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions."" Stores are preparing to reopen on London's Regent Street The chancellor acknowledged many people would be ""anxious"" at the prospect of going out shopping again after almost three months in lockdown. But he stressed ""it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence"". ""Shops up and down the country are desperate to welcome us all back and I think we all want to see our High Streets spring back to life again,"" he said. Steven Hall said clothing store Brother2Brother would have to innovate Designer men's clothing retailer Brother2Brother will be reopening its Reading store on Monday for the first time since March. Buying director Steven Hall said the firm ""could not wait"" to reopen, although the shopping experience might be different from what customers are used to - with staff provided with PPE and a limit of six customers at a time. In addition to ""cleaning of counters after every purchase [and] cleaning of the changing rooms after use... we will also have to quarantine the goods for at least 24 hours before they are put back into circulation"". He added that customers will be encouraged to try things on at home and return them where possible and ""pretty much everything"" will be given a sale price as the company looks to shift its seasonal stock. One way the store is attempting to drum up business is by letting customers book 30-minute slots, allowing staff to prepare a selection of items suited to their tastes. ""If we don't try to innovate and make sure business can operate at some sort of level we probably wouldn't be here for very long,"" Mr Hall said. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY,external. And Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of The British Independent Retailers Association, believes people may ""soon become weary of queuing"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for retailers, is urging the public to ""play their part"" in making shopping safer.

'It's very exciting to be returning to work',"""It's very exciting, we can't wait to have our customers back,"" says Annie Martin, who manages the Waterstones Piccadilly bookshop, in London. Non-essential retailers, such as fashion, toy and book shops, will be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June - as long as they have coronavirus-related safety measures in place. Waterstones, for example, is introducing Perspex ""sneeze screens"" and a quarantine trolley where books that have been browsed will be held for ""a couple of days"". ""We want to keep bookshop experience exactly as it normally would be,"" says Annie. ""We're still encouraging people to browse, we're just looking after those books once you've browsed them."" Annie has been working on implementing those changes behind-the-scenes, but is also looking forward to seeing her colleagues back in-store. ""Bookshops are quite close teams... We've been messaging, but it's not quite the same as seeing colleagues in person for a chat, particularly about the books you've been reading on furlough."" When will shops open and what will the rules be? Special offers 'pulled from shelves during lockdown' 'Your High Street is back open for business' Suki, who works at a Boots beauty hall in London, also says that it's ""refreshing to come back to work, which is like my second home"". Most Boots stores have remained open during lockdown. That means that staff on the beauty counter have had the chance to trial different ways of working about a week before shoppers return to the High Street. Boots is removing all make-up testers, and assistants will wear plastic visors in its beauty halls, to try to keep both customers and staff safe. Suki acknowledges that some changes could make shopping more difficult. That there won't be testers is ""going to be a shock for a lot of us, because with beauty you often need to try things on,"" she said. ""The visor isn't the most glamorous thing in the world, but it does mean that I'm not touching my face and my make-up can stay on longer. And, safety isn't supposed to be glamorous,"" she adds. Overall, Suki feels as though she's in a safe pair of hands: ""We're all as nervous as each other, so I think as long as we all take the necessary steps, we'll be fine."" Shoppers, though, might be feeling more anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external One trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), is urging the public to ""play their part"" in making shopping safer. Along with 25 other retailers, it says customers should follow five steps: Queue considerately Maintain social distancing Follow instructions inside and outside shops Follow all necessary hygiene measures Be respectful to shop staff Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said: ""Every visit we make helps support jobs in retail, as well as throughout the supply chain. Retailers have been working around the clock to create a safe shopping environment"". ""Our shopping experience may be changing, but if we all follow the necessary social distancing measures and show a little consideration to those around us, then everyone will be better off."" Her plea was echoed by Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase. ""While the vast majority of our customers have adhered to the safety measures we have in store, in recent weeks, a small minority of shoppers are disobeying the guidelines set out and at times reacting abusively when challenged by store teams,"" he said. ""It's for this reason we're calling on members of the public to help us reverse the trend that saw cases of abusive incidents towards shop workers rise by 9% during the last year."" For any customers who don't want to go into a store, HMV will offer to do their shopping for them. From Monday, people can drop in a shopping list, a team member will collect it, package it up and have it waiting for the customer to pick up later. Alternatively, customers can ring their local HMV to have a product put aside for them to collect later on. The idea came from the chain's Canadian customers who have been a little bit more cautious about returning to stores as opposed to its US shoppers, says its owner Doug Putman. So what does he expect from customers in England when HMV opens 93 shops on Monday?Read more here. Many retailers in England will soon open their doors for the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown.Those in Northern Ireland have been open since Friday. John Lewis stores in Poole and Kingstonwill be the first to reopen on 15 June, followed by another 11 shops later that week. Marks & Spencer will also reopen the majority of its clothing stores. Primark has also announced that it will reopen,externalall 153 of its stores in England on Monday. This video can not be played Bluewater shopping centre prepares to reopen on 15 June Meanwhile, Debenhams will open 50 shops in England.The firm collapsed for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business. It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 of its stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted. It is still in discussions over a ""handful"" of others. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""The survival of so many retailers will hinge on the success of reopening stores over the coming weeks and the pace at which consumers return."" Mr Lim also pointed out that the ""significant shift"" towards online seen during lockdown may change shopping habits for good. ""Many of these consumers are shopping for goods online for the first time, overcoming the barriers of setting up online accounts, entering payment details and gaining trust. It is inevitable that some of these behaviours will become sticky,"" he said. Former John Lewis boss and current mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, told Sky News he hopes to see a permanent reform to business rates, a kind of council tax businesses pay. He is also keen on proposals for a digital sales tax for online retailers, ""making sure online companies pay a fair share,"" he said. For physical shops, a rare ray of sunshine from the lockdown could be customers wanting to visit local shops as they work from home and spend more time near their homes, he added. ""I do believe one of the things to come out of this is a concentration on local areas,"" he told Sky.

Which shops are reopening on Monday?,"Many non-essential shops have already reopened, and now restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, outdoor gyms, and other venues will be able to join them from 4 July So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are already throwing open their doors to customers again. Shops in Northern Ireland have reopened too. Many have been announcing their plans: John Lewis isstarting by opening 13 branchesin stages Next is reopening just 25 of its 500 stores at first Debenhams isreopening 50 stores in Englandand three in Northern Ireland Marks and Spencer is reopening all its shops in England and Northern Ireland JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its stores in England Primark is reopening all 153 of its stores in England Argos, which has kept outlets in Sainsbury's stores open, is reopening 145 standalone stores for click and collect TopShop is reopening all its stores in England and selected ones in Northern Ireland Music retailer HMV is reopening 93 of its 113 stores Currys PC World is reopening 131 of its outlets Mobile phone operators are reopening too. Three UK is starting with 250 stores, Vodafone is opening 65 and EE is opening all its shops in England, while O2 has opened ""some"" shops River Island is opening 150 stores, with more to follow on Thursday Gap is reopening all its 81 shops in England H&M is opening ""the majority"" of its English stores DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikeaopened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Can my boss force me to go back to work? Shops which reopenmust meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines.,external These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2 metres (6ft) apart had become a regular fixture. But this 2m-metre rule has now been reduced to a minimum of 1m. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. What will a post-lockdown high street look like? Jobs go as Debenhams shuts more stores All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone,external. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. A reduction of the 2m distancing rule to what the prime minister called a ""1m-plus rule"" means many businesses in England have been given the green light to reopen from 4 July. Pubs and restaurants can start serving customers indoors, although it will be limited to table service only. Hairdressers can reopen, but staff must wear visors. Museums, hotels, cinemas, camping parks and outdoor gyms are among other areas that can also reopen provided safety measures are in place, such as distancing. But nightclubs, swimming pools, indoor gyms and casinos are among sectors that will remain closed.

In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said thatall shops can open on Monday 22 Juneas long as they havesocial distancing measuresin place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that smaller shops and outdoor marketswill be allowed to reopen from 29 June in phase twoof the country's lockdown-easing plan. Shops of all sizes will be able to open from that date as long as they have outdoor entrances and exits. Indoor shopping centres will remain closed, except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in his latest easing measures that he expects Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to continue ""responding at their own pace"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers Â£1.8bn a week in lost sales. However,there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birminghambefore their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Primark says no 'special discounts' at reopening Most shops - like this Primark in Birmingham - have been locked since 23 March Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Lockerin the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains.

'Living on my own has been a very lonely time',"Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog."" For people living alone like Jan Maddox, 71, the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data. Boris Johnson has announced that, in England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household. But that's not the case in Wales, with Cardiff Bay saying changes will only be made when it's safe to do so. And Jan, whose partner lives in the Midlands, is starting to struggle. ""I did have a terrific social life,"" she said. ""I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Jan, from Newport is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. They are a group atsignificantly greater risk,externalof loneliness during lockdown. Loneliness and lockdown exploited in romance scams Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Mental struggles captured in lockdown 'Profound' impact predicted on mental health ""I have a lot of texts from friends, and people ring up, from that perspective it's been really good,"" she said. ""At the beginning we managed alright. But now we're three months in... I think mentally we're getting a bit stretched."" Wales' next lockdown review is due on 18 June, but it is not clear whether there will be similar support bubble measures introduced. New ONS data,externalshowed working-age adults living alone are at greater risk of lockdown loneliness than older people, and those aged 16-24 more than twice as likely to have experienced it than those aged 55-69. Craig Johnson says living alone during lockdown has been ""draining"" Craig Johnson, 29, lives in Cardiff and says there's a ""tension"" between what people living alone would like to see on an individual level, and what ""the collective societal thing needs to be"". ""I live alone in a small flat. In normal times I would've largely just come home to eat, come home to sleep. ""The rest of the time I'm either working in an office with colleagues, with friends or I'm in a pub, or a restaurant or cafÃ©, with friends, or friends are coming here for food. ""Prior to March every bit of what made my life happy, every positive thing to look forward to during the week are the kind of things not now allowed - and with good reason. All of my life was non-essential social and close contact. ""From a public health angle, I support the fact they aren't allowed. But it's kind of follows that if everything I did that was a good thing in my life, I can't now do, that has knock-on effects for how happy and mentally healthy you feel. ""Draining I think is the word."" Craig said he broadly supported the Welsh Government's ""more cautious approach"". He added: ""The UK government has been talking about quarantine corridors between the UK and other countries so that people could have holidays in Portugal or in Spain. I watched that thinking: 'I've not had a hug for three months.' Can we balance the priorities a little bit?"" Julia Lloyd says loneliness in lockdown has been ""immense"" without friends living nearby. For Julia Lloyd, 66, who lives inland from Colwyn Bay, the differences in lockdown rules between England and Wales have made things harder. ""You accept it, you accept it, you accept it. But then when you hear what England are getting you think, 'hang on a minute. Why can they do that and I can't?'."" Julia said before lockdown she had a ""really good social life"" but has felt ""really shutdown"" since and has experienced anxiety attacks. ""Because I live out in the country and I don't have any neighbours - I just don't see another human being. For 14 weeks, the only other person I've seen is the postman or a food delivery driver. ""I have some days I just get so down I spent half the day crying, because I just don't see when I'm going to be able to see people or do anything. ""I'm lonely, I don't see anybody. All I see is sheep. ""I have times I feel like I am being punished for abiding by all the rules and regulations."" Simon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru, said: ""The coronavirus pandemic is as much a mental health crisis as it is a physical one. ""People are really struggling with isolation, stress, grief, financial worries and fears about the future. ""People who live alone have been particularly affected by lockdown, and we know that loneliness is a real problem."" He said it is ""especially important"" to reach out to people who live alone at the moment. ""A good place to start is to ask them how they are, and what support they need, and listen non-judgementally to their response."" Julie Morgan MS launched the Welsh Government's loneliness strategy in February. Before the lockdown began, the Welsh Government launched a loneliness strategy, including a fund of Â£1.4m over three years to help tackle it. Julie Morgan MS, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, said Â£440,000 of this has been given to a scheme to tackle loneliness in older people at this time - by pairing them up with volunteers to speak to weekly. But she acknowledged loneliness during lockdown is an issue particularly affecting young people. ""Obviously, the physical health of people is the primary concern. But we are aware that the longer it goes on, it does have an effect on people's mental health. ""So all of the decisions we make are a fine balance between those two - we are trying to do all we possibly can to mitigate loneliness and the inevitable mental health problems that arise from that."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Ministers review all the restrictions in place at each review period - and then decide what, if anything, can be changed.

Call for Â£250m coronavirus recovery fund,"Many of Wales' poorest areas have been hardest hit by the pandemic A coronavirus community recovery fund worth Â£250m should be set up to support the hardest-hit communities, the Welsh Conservatives have said. The party's group leader in the Welsh Parliament said it would help address a ""public economic crisis"". Paul Davies said business rates could be scrapped for certain businesses in the worst-affected towns. He said the money was already available, but Welsh Labour has questioned the figures. The Conservatives' policy announcement follows the publication of a report that claimeda number of Welsh towns were among the most vulnerable across the UK. Under the party's plans, a Â£250m fund would be established for the term of the next Welsh Parliament to support the worst-affected communities. The Conservatives said it would allow the establishment of ""business rate-free zones"" where business rates would be scrapped for all businesses for three years. Beyond those zones, the party wants to scrap business rates for businesses with a rateable value of up to Â£15,000. Currently, businesses with a rateable value of less than Â£6,000 are exempt from paying rates and the amount payable is tapered for those valued between Â£6,000 and Â£12,000. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We are going through not only a public health crisis, but we're also going through a public economic crisis,"" Mr Davies told the BBC'sPolitics Wales. ""And that's why it's absolutely crucial now as we come out of this pandemic that we support the communities which will be hardest-hit by this pandemic."" Mr Davies said the business rates relief scheme would ""support those existing businesses in those communities, but also attract new businesses"". He claimed there was enough money in the Welsh Government's coffers to pay for the scheme as a result of UK government spending on the pandemic in England. But a Welsh Labour spokesman said that was not the case: ""The Welsh Conservatives seem not to understand that there are strict limits in the extent to which we can carry forward funds from one year to the next, with our maximum reserve being Â£350m. ""Small businesses with premises with a rateable value of less than Â£12,000 already get small business rate relief.

'Living on my own has been a very lonely time'New data shows people living alone are at greater risk of loneliness during lockdown.Wales politics,"Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog."" For people living alone like Jan Maddox, 71, the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data. Boris Johnson has announced that, in England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household. But that's not the case in Wales, with Cardiff Bay saying changes will only be made when it's safe to do so. And Jan, whose partner lives in the Midlands, is starting to struggle. ""I did have a terrific social life,"" she said. ""I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Jan, from Newport is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. They are a group atsignificantly greater risk,externalof loneliness during lockdown. Loneliness and lockdown exploited in romance scams Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Mental struggles captured in lockdown 'Profound' impact predicted on mental health ""I have a lot of texts from friends, and people ring up, from that perspective it's been really good,"" she said. ""At the beginning we managed alright. But now we're three months in... I think mentally we're getting a bit stretched."" Wales' next lockdown review is due on 18 June, but it is not clear whether there will be similar support bubble measures introduced. New ONS data,externalshowed working-age adults living alone are at greater risk of lockdown loneliness than older people, and those aged 16-24 more than twice as likely to have experienced it than those aged 55-69. Craig Johnson says living alone during lockdown has been ""draining"" Craig Johnson, 29, lives in Cardiff and says there's a ""tension"" between what people living alone would like to see on an individual level, and what ""the collective societal thing needs to be"". ""I live alone in a small flat. In normal times I would've largely just come home to eat, come home to sleep. ""The rest of the time I'm either working in an office with colleagues, with friends or I'm in a pub, or a restaurant or cafÃ©, with friends, or friends are coming here for food. ""Prior to March every bit of what made my life happy, every positive thing to look forward to during the week are the kind of things not now allowed - and with good reason. All of my life was non-essential social and close contact. ""From a public health angle, I support the fact they aren't allowed. But it's kind of follows that if everything I did that was a good thing in my life, I can't now do, that has knock-on effects for how happy and mentally healthy you feel. ""Draining I think is the word."" Craig said he broadly supported the Welsh Government's ""more cautious approach"". He added: ""The UK government has been talking about quarantine corridors between the UK and other countries so that people could have holidays in Portugal or in Spain. I watched that thinking: 'I've not had a hug for three months.' Can we balance the priorities a little bit?"" Julia Lloyd says loneliness in lockdown has been ""immense"" without friends living nearby. For Julia Lloyd, 66, who lives inland from Colwyn Bay, the differences in lockdown rules between England and Wales have made things harder. ""You accept it, you accept it, you accept it. But then when you hear what England are getting you think, 'hang on a minute. Why can they do that and I can't?'."" Julia said before lockdown she had a ""really good social life"" but has felt ""really shutdown"" since and has experienced anxiety attacks. ""Because I live out in the country and I don't have any neighbours - I just don't see another human being. For 14 weeks, the only other person I've seen is the postman or a food delivery driver. ""I have some days I just get so down I spent half the day crying, because I just don't see when I'm going to be able to see people or do anything. ""I'm lonely, I don't see anybody. All I see is sheep. ""I have times I feel like I am being punished for abiding by all the rules and regulations."" Simon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru, said: ""The coronavirus pandemic is as much a mental health crisis as it is a physical one. ""People are really struggling with isolation, stress, grief, financial worries and fears about the future. ""People who live alone have been particularly affected by lockdown, and we know that loneliness is a real problem."" He said it is ""especially important"" to reach out to people who live alone at the moment. ""A good place to start is to ask them how they are, and what support they need, and listen non-judgementally to their response."" Julie Morgan MS launched the Welsh Government's loneliness strategy in February. Before the lockdown began, the Welsh Government launched a loneliness strategy, including a fund of Â£1.4m over three years to help tackle it. Julie Morgan MS, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, said Â£440,000 of this has been given to a scheme to tackle loneliness in older people at this time - by pairing them up with volunteers to speak to weekly. But she acknowledged loneliness during lockdown is an issue particularly affecting young people. ""Obviously, the physical health of people is the primary concern. But we are aware that the longer it goes on, it does have an effect on people's mental health. ""So all of the decisions we make are a fine balance between those two - we are trying to do all we possibly can to mitigate loneliness and the inevitable mental health problems that arise from that."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Ministers review all the restrictions in place at each review period - and then decide what, if anything, can be changed.

And finally... you've been kept up-to-date today by our team of reporters in the UK: Rebecca Seales, Vicky Baker, Joshua Cheetham, Becky Morton, Alex Therrien, Sarah Collerton, Ashitha Nagesh, George Wright and Victoria Lindrea. Our colleagues in Singapore will be resuming live coverage at 0500 BST on Monday. Authorities in Sri Lanka have held mock elections as part of a test of new anti-coronavirus voting measures. Voters wore face masks, stood 1m (3ft) apart in queues and brought their own pens and pencils to mark ballot papers. Officials were protected by plastic screens or face shields, and sprayed disinfectants on voters. Sri Lanka postponed parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for April, because of the virus. The vote is due to be held on 5 August. Sunday's trial run was held in four of the country's 22 electoral districts. It was designed to get voters used to the new system and see if extra voting time was needed. Read more here The Indian government has called an urgent meeting of the leaders of the country's main political parties to discuss the coronavirus crisis in Delhi. The meeting, which will be held tomorrow, comes after India reported almost 12,000 new cases in 24 hours. Delhi's hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, with reports of people dying after being repeatedly turned away from different hospitals. It's estimated the health system will need tens of thousands more beds in the coming weeks in order to deal with the virus, which hasn't yet peaked. About 500 railway carriages are going to be converted into Covid wards. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Indian hospitals struggle to cope with the outbreak Katy AustinBusiness Correspondent From Monday, all non-essential retailers will be allowed to reopen in England. But not all shops will raise the shutters on day one - the
reopening will be gradual. For many, itâs an important opportunity to
welcome customers back to spend in store. Having spent time and money preparing
safety measures in line with âCovid-secureâ guidelines, they are hoping
shoppers have the confidence to return, and that they follow rules on queuing
and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity. However, businesses
Iâve spoken to expect much lower levels of trade overall in the coming months,
compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit
the number of customers in store - another is that the experience will be
different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no taking a
break inside a cafe or restaurant, while hospitality venues remain closed to
sit-in customers. The lockdown also accelerated change that had already begun: A move towards more online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be
needed in future. Thousands of people formed a socially distanced human chain in Berlin today to protest against racism, while observing coronavirus guidance. The chain stretched from the Brandenburg Gate, past the old East Berlin television tower, and into NeukÃ¶lln district. Political parties, climate change campaigners and other activist groups - including Grannies Against the Far Right - took part in protest events in several German cities. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. You are likely to see them in other shops too, such as bookseller Waterstones and Boots, the UK's biggest pharmacy chain. Some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - will be in place to try to reduce the virus spread. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones says it will ""quarantine"" books for 72 hours after people have touched them. The number of customers allowed in stores will also be limited, and businesses have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,external. But despite these precautions, many shoppers are feeling anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The daily coronavirus death toll reported by the government tells you how many deaths were recorded that day - not how many actually happened. So we expect to see lower figures at weekends. Even accounting for the Sunday effect though, todayâs figure of 36 deaths in all settings across the UK is hopeful - itâs the lowest daily figure seen since before lockdown. Last Sunday, the grim toll was down to 55 and, the week before that, 111 Covid deaths were recorded. But the day before lockdown when recorded deaths were last at this level, it took under a fortnight for this figure to have increased ten-fold. The outbreak escalated with frightening speed and came down much more slowly. With further relaxations to lockdown kicking in from Monday, scientists and government will be keeping a sharp eye on these figures in the hope that another uncontrollable escalation can be prevented. As face coverings become mandatory on public transport in England from tomorrow, we've been listening to what you have to say. Christine Bithrey, from London, told us she has chronic asthma and that wearing a mask makes it feel harder for her to breathe. In a government briefing earlier this month, transport minister Grant Shapps said people with breathing difficulties would be exempt from the new law. Christine is currently working from home but she doesn't want to use public transport, because as her condition is hidden, she fears she will be attacked or stopped for not wearing a mask. ""I am terrified about the prospect of using public transport"", she says. ""A couple of weeks ago I went on a bus to a different location, and I was coughing because of my asthma. I am nearly 60.
A man appeared in front of me with a disgusting tissue and asked me to put it over my mouth."" But Christine says she will need to travel to work at some point. ""I have no idea how I am going to get to my office,"" she says.
""I spoke to some staff at Camden Road station who said they weren't even aware of any exemptions.
If London Transport Police approaches me, how can I prove I have a health condition?"" Australia's two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, have announced their latest plans to ease lockdown restrictions. NSW officials have said the 50-person limit at funerals will be lifted immediately, while nightclubs and music festivals will be allowed to operate from August if new cases of coronavirus remain low. Meanwhile in Victoria, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated customers at a time - an increase from the current limit of 20 - from 22 June. Restaurants in parts of the country, including Sydney, had already reopened earlier this month. Australia has had 7,320 confirmed cases, and a total death toll of 102. There's a festive atmosphere at London Zoo ahead of its reopening tomorrow, and the gorillas have had bunting put up in their treehouses as they prepare to greet fans once again. The zoo closed in March when the UK went into lockdown. When it reopens on Monday, there'll be limits on visitor numbers, one-way routes, and paw-print-shaped social distancing markers. Daniel Simmonds, team leader of the zoo's primates, told Reuters news agency the gorillas ""have already adjusted to the fact that people haven't been coming in, but equally I am absolutely sure they are going to be really excited when they see lots of friendly visitor faces visiting them tomorrow"". Almost 11,000 Germans will be arriving in Spain's Balearic islands next week as part of a scheme helping to boost the tourism industry after it was ground to a halt by the coronavirus pandemic. They will start landing on Monday and most will stay on the largest island, Mallorca. However a smaller number will head to Ibiza and Menorca. So who are the lucky ones? Spanish news outlet El Mundo has declared them ""false tourists"", as they are industry professionals, such as travel agents and hotel owners, rather than random holidaymakers. Their trip is a test run, so others can hopefully follow in their footsteps. The visitors will be exempt from virus testing and mandatory two-week quarantines, which are in force across mainland Spain. But they will have to fill out a form, have their temperatures taken on arrival, and provide authorities with their contact details and accommodation addresses so they can be traced if necessary. Tourism is a vital industry for the islands, accounting for approximately a third of the region's economy. But unlike their German counterparts, Spaniards are still prohibited from visiting anywhere but their home regions. Spain was initially set to reopen its borders to other EU countries from 1 July. But this weekend Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said this will be moved to a week earlier. The 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas travellers to Spain will also expire on 21 June. The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan could more than double by the end of this month and peak at 1.2 million a month later, the country's planning minister Asad Umar has warned. Pakistan currently has almost 140,000 confirmed cases and its death toll is more than 2,600. However, because testing remains limited, it's thought that the real numbers are higher. ""Expert estimates say the number of confirmed cases could go up to 300,000 by the end of June if we keep on flouting SOPs [standard operating procedures] and taking the problem lightly,"" said Umar. He issued the warning as people reportedly ignore guidance on social distancing and hygiene measures to stem the spread of the virus. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon hopes to allow more social interaction this week Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she remains optimistic that she will be able to announce to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the country is ready to move into phase two of easing lockdown measures, and that people in the ""shielded"" group will be able to go outdoors for exercise. The first minister said at today's briefing that she may announce a partial move, rather than a complete move to phase two. She said this could allow more social interaction, the re-mobilisation of the NHS, and would indicate when the retail sector might reopen. The first minister also stressed the importance of social distancing, and said the two-metre rule would remain under review, but would only be reduced if it was deemed safe to do so. Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was killed recently As some coronavirus restrictions have been eased in South Africa there has been a surge in violence against women, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. He called it a ""dark and shameful week"" for his country. Several women have been killed, including Tshegofatso Pule - who was eight months pregnant when she was found stabbed and hanging from a tree. Among the restrictions that have been lifted recently are a ban on the sale of alcohol. ""Gender-based violence thrives in a climate of silence. With our silence, by looking the other way because we believe it is a personal or family matter, we become complicit in this most insidious of crimes,"" the president said. Read the full storyhere. Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line withnew World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport. Elsewhere in the UK:  Read more here  The Visual and Data Journalism Team As we reported earlier, the UK today saw its lowest rise in the number of people who died after testing positive for coronavirus (36) since 22 March, though figures tend to be lower at the weekend due to reporting delays. Here's a look at how the UK's outbreak is changing, in charts. Next week US President Donald Trump is planning to hold an election rally in the US city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. But Tulsa's public health director, Bruce Dart, says he is concerned about the risks it poses due to the national outbreak of coronavirus. âI think itâs an honour for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,â Dr Dart told local outlet Tulsa World. Oklahoma and Tulsa County reported a record increase in infections on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. As of Saturday, more than 8,000 cases and 359 deaths have been confirmed across the state. âCovid is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,â Dr Dart said. âI wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isnât as large a concern as it is today. âIâm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and Iâm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well,â he added. A 70-year-old man who nearly died of coronavirus has reportedly been handed a $1.1m (Â£876,000) medical bill in the US. The Seattle Times reported that Michael Flor racked up the bill after needing 62 days of hospital treatment. Flor was so seriously ill that at one point nurses held up a phone for him so he could say goodbye to his wife and children. The 181-page bill totalled $1,122,501.04. However, Flor shouldn't have to dig into his own pockets as he is covered by Medicare, a government insurance program for the elderly. ""It was a million bucks to save my life, and of course I'd say that's money well-spent ... But I also know I might be the only one saying that,"" he told the Times. Ione WellsBBC News Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown For people living alone the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. In England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household- but that's not the case in Wales. Jan Maddox, 71, is from Newport in south Wales but her partner lives in the Midlands. She is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog,"" she says. ""I did have a terrific social life. I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Read more. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the
total number of deaths to 41,698,
according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest
daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures
tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Next year's exams may take place later than normal, according to Education Secretary John Swinney. He toldBBC Scotland's Politics Scotlandit was possible the timetable could be put back to allow courses to be completed. Normally the diet begins towards the end of April. This year, exams were cancelled for the first time ever. Mr Swinney accepted next year's exams could also have to be cancelled but was hopeful that would not happen. Read more. Dr Muge Cevik has studied cases from around the world The World Health Organisation said this week that coronavirus could
be transmitted by people who never develop symptoms, so may not know they are carrying the virus. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases expert at St Andrews
University, has studied a range of asymptomatic cases from contact tracing
around the world. ""What we found is that while asymptomatic patients can
certainly transmit the virus to others, they transmit the infection to fewer
cases, which means they are less contagious compared to someone with symptoms,"" she toldPolitics Scotland. Ms Cevik said transmission rates depend on many different aspects, including the duration of the contact, proximity, and the environment. She explained that 'super-spreaders' - cases when maybe 20 people are infected at the same time - occur when someone at their most infectious goes to an all-day meeting for example, or a crowded indoor event, and then might go out for dinner afterwards. ""If the same person had an evening at home, we might not see any transmission,"" she added. We still need to understand when patients are at their most infectious, but it seems to be when they start to develop symptoms or feel mildly unwell."" Dr Muge Cevik  Allow Twitter content?

The Isle of Man has become the first place in the British Isles to announce that it will drop social distancing. The rules, which apply to the general public, will be relaxed from Monday. Although 24 people have died as a result of coronavirus on the Isle of Man, there have been no new cases there for 22 days. Social distancing will remain for those working in hospitals and care homes. Gatherings will be restricted to 30 people outdoors, while people indoors will be able to invite up to two people into their homes from another household. Restaurants, gyms and schools will reopen. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 41,698, according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. If the tourism industry is able to reopen as early as 15 July, as minister Fergus Ewing this week indicated is the target, would that include overnight
stays, and tourists travelling to Scotland from outside, asks the Scotsman. Nicola Sturgeon says the government will have to assess a number of issues between now and then, but she ""would certainly hope"" that by the middle of
July, people will be able to go on holiday within Scotland. ""We very much want that 15
July date to be a real one we can meet,"" she says, but that it ""remains conditional at this stage"". ""I know how important it is to our tourist and hospitality
sector that we get them reopening and operating as quickly as possible,"" she adds. Regarding borders into Scotland, the first minister says there are regulations in place that will be reviewed on
a regular cycle, and judgements will be made based on the data and
science available. Everything we are talking about here â education, the economy, tourism â we want to get as much normality restored as quickly as possible, but that all depends on continuing to suppress this virus."" Nicola Sturgeon Asked if she has had a chance to see her family yet, Ms Sturgeon says work commitments have not allowed that so far. ""Assuming it doesnât rain later on
today I may this evening go to visit my mum and dad in their garden - socially distanced - as long as the rain doesnât start,"" she says. ""My mum is probably watching right now which means I will not get the chance to wriggle off that particular commitment."" Chris Green from the i raises a question about data on the impact of easing
lockdown on virus transmission. ""The data we have is the data we
publish every day,"" says Ms Sturgeon. ""At the moment all of that data is
going in the right direction so we do not yet see a negative impact from the
changes that were made two weeks ago. ""I wouldnât say we are at the
stage yet where we can say categorically
there has been no impact."" Prof Jason Leitch is asked what the latest scientific recommendations are in terms of children returning to school. Scotland's national clinical director says we know that:  Very few children have died globally, but there have been
some cases, Prof Leitch says. He points out that Beijing has closed its schools again as part ofa reimposition of lockdown measures, after a new outbreak
of 45 cases in a market. ""We have to be very careful not to put children at risk,"" he adds. The first minister says she hopes the UK government will avoid an ""austerity approach"" when dealing with the economic fall-out from the coronavirus crisis. In response to a question on deficit from PA, Nicola Sturgeon reminds us that it is the UK government that is doing the lion's share of borrowing, since her government's borrowing power is limited. She says the Scottish government will continue to do everything it can to mitigate the economic impact of lockdown, including getting businesses up and running again when it is safe to do so. However, she stresses the need for support and hopes the UK government will take a long-term view to recovery, while adding that she will continue to make a case for extending the current Job Retention Scheme beyond October. If the Scottish government took decisive action in spending billions of pounds to swiftly build the temporary NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, why are temporary classrooms and playgrounds not being built right now to ease the burden on schools, asks the Daily Telegraph. Nicola Sturgeon says the government will continue to support local authorities with whatever they need, but given that statutory responsibility for
education lies with them, it is only right those authorities look at the plans they want to put in place. The principles are the same however, says the first minister. ""We must be prepared to do extraordinary things to support people
through extraordinary times,"" she says. The practical issues of building a temporary hospital and providing education provision in every part of the country are not the same, she adds, but the principle of making sure children get the education they
deserve is at the heart of what they will take forward with councils. Ryan Maher of STV goes back to education and asks about the duration of the mix of home and face-to-face learning from August. âI hope it is the case that over
the next academic year we do see schools returning to normal,"" says the first minister. ""But it is not
possible for us right now from this vantage point to give dates and say that
with certainty.â  Channel 4 say they have seen a leaked letter from public health chiefs outlining a series of concerns around plans to routinely test care home staff. The first minister says the chief medical officer has replied to the letter in question and says she would not characterise it as a ""falling out"", while stressing that there are different scientific and clinical opinions on the best way to handle the crisis. Not everyone in the clinical community thinks that testing, particularly with asymptomatic people, is the right thing to do, she says, acknowledging the pressure her government has come under to increase the number of tests for care home staff. ""These things are not always clear cut - but we have to try to come to the best view to move forward,"" she says. Prof Jason Leitch is full of praise for all of Scotland's leading public health officials but again refers to a ""diversity of views"" on the virus, talking about the ""pyramid of science"" - taking lots of opinions to filter and build a strategy. The subject of education is raised by Christine Lavelle from The Sun following union calls for more money for emergency classrooms and extra staff. âThe process we are going through
right now is that local authorities are putting plans in place for the blended model of
learning that we will see from 11 August onwards,"" says the first minister. ""The Scottish government will then
look at that and we will make judgments about what additional support is going
to be necessary."" She says she wants children to return safely to schools and see ""as much normality as
quickly as possible"". The Daily Mail also asks about a possible review of the 2m distancing guidance and infection rates. The first minister says that the R number in Scotland appears to be lower than other parts of the UK as the number of cases decline. ""The lesson I take from that is that our careful, cautious plan is working, and not seek to throw it away and do something different,"" she explains. ""So let's continue down this well thought out path. The more we suppress this virus right now, the greater chance we have of reintroducing normality to our everyday lives."" Nicola Sturgeon says while transmission of the virus is much reduced, there are still a ""significant number"" of infected people in Scotland, and new cases every day. The risk remains that if we move too quickly and start coming into
closer contact with too many people, cases could multiply again quickly, says the first minister. ""While there are no risk-free options, and we shouldnât slow
down progress in pursuit of perfect, risk-free options that donât exist, equally
we must not ease restrictions at a pace that very obviously heighten the risk,"" Ms Sturgeon says. ""We should also realise the prize for going a bit more cautiously
now could be a return to greater normality in the medium term."" The first minister points out that with the R number - the rate of infection -estimated to be rising slightly in England and other countries, it is a reminder to assess and check the impact of lockdown-easing measures. Morag Kinniburgh of the BBC asks if two metre distancing will be looked at again, in light of Prime Minister Boris Johnsoncommissioning a review into the rule. ""I said last week and I will
repeat it again, that we will keep that under review,"" replies the first minister. ""We will look closely at the
case for reducing the 2m rule and the circumstances in which that might be
appropriate. If we deem it is safe to reduce that, then we will do so."" She stresses it is important not to consider any measures in isolation. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Are Scotland's care homes able to care?It is suggested the coronavirus crisis has shown up private care homes but they say they need better funding.,"Private care homes are getting some of the heat for the spread of coronavirus and high numbers of residents' deaths. That has led to claims they should be in public hands, and that they are raking off excess profits. There are examples of that. But the wider problem seems to have more to do with under-funding than profiteering. Indeed, private care homes in Britain are struggling with unsustainably low levels of government-paid fees. The shortfall is reckoned to be around Â£1bn, and much of that is made up with excess fees, paid by older and vulnerable residents, required to draw on often modest savings. That was the finding of the Competition and Markets Authority, when it took a close look at the private care home sector in 2017. It was trying to find out if the market operated in the interests of those who have to use the homes. The answer: not sufficiently. At the point of choosing a home, people are often in a weak position to choose or negotiate. But the other main finding was that local government is failing to pay sufficient fees to make the sector sustainable. It needs more to pay for repairs and maintenance, and to attract new investors, when demographic change points to the need for a big rise in capacity. Care homes: Questions and Answers Those that are building new care homes are doing so in affluent areas, where they can attract wealthier ""self-funders"", the CMA found. In Scotland, a self-funder is someone who has to pay their way, after getting the standard government grants for nursing and personal care - if they're assessed as needing them. With care home fees for private individuals costing more than Â£900 per week on average, that's Â£200 more than the nationally negotiated set rate for council-funded residents. Residential care home beds (2017): 32,799 in total Long-stay: 31,223 Private sector: 26,053 Council/NHS: 3606 Voluntary: 3032 Long stay residents with dementia: 62% Average length of residency: 1.5 years. Discharges from care homes: 85% due to the resident dying 7% move care home 5% leave for hospital 1% go back to their own homes. Local authority rates for 2020-21: Nursing home: Â£740 per week Residential home: Â£635 *Sources: ISD census: Scottish Care: Competition and Markets Authority The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) tells care homes what it thinks is reasonable to pay. It assumes the minimum level of staffing, and a minimum Â£9.30 per hour for care assistants, though the maximum isn't much more. Scottish Care, which represents most private care homes, says the National Care Contract assumes a lower level of nurse pay than equivalent work in the NHS. There's heating, and less than Â£6 a day for food. A 4% margin is allowed for profit. For a nursing home resident, that comes to a weekly Â£740 this year. Care Scotland says the true price should be Â£950 to Â£1000. But it's not in a strong negotiating position. In England, each council negotiates its own rates, leaving a much less clear picture. The rates for private individuals in England can be up to a third higher than the council rate. An alternative analysis of the private care home sector, by the GMB trade union, found that care homes can be far too profitable, and that some people have become very rich. Ownership is hard to pin down, through complex corporate vehicles, these ""private equity"" owners are hard to determine, sometimes because their profits go to tax havens. That union research suggests the bumper profits are made from property rather than running the service. But the GMB argues that it has a direct effect on the low pay and poor employment conditions of care home workers. The private equity ownership model accounts for fewer than a fifth of Scottish care homes.

"Woman hatches ducks from Waitrose eggsBeep, Peep and Meep started life on a supermarket shelf but will now live with Charli Lello's chickens.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Beep, Peep and Meep are Braddock White ducklings A woman has hatched three ducklings called Beep, Peep and Meep from eggs she bought in Waitrose. Charli Lello, 29, from Hertfordshire, put the Clarence Court eggs in an incubator as an experiment to pass the time after being furloughed. She said the ducklings would live ""a very happy life"" with her pet chickens. A Waitrose spokesman said fertilised eggs were safe to eat and ""entirely indistinguishable"" from normal eggs, unless incubated. Charli Lello hatched the ducklings as an experiment to pass the time while furloughed from work Ms Lello, who normally works as an assistant manager in a shop, got the idea after seeing a video on Facebook of someone hatching quail eggs from a supermarket. ""While I was in Waitrose, I saw the duck eggs and thought maybe they would work as well. I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs. ""They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way."" The ducklings hatched from Clarence Court Braddock Whites free range duck eggs A month after putting them in the incubator, Ms Lello heard a tiny beeping sound and the Braddock White ducklings started to emerge from their shells. Dog 'adopts' nine orphaned ducklings Ducklings saved after mother run over Family 'shocked' by slithering toilet snake She said it had been an ""amazing"" experience hatching the ""cutest little balls of fluff"" but she would not be repeating it. ""The only reason I could try was because I am currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they won't need me all day. Under normal circumstances it wouldn't have been possible or fair on them,"" she said. Two of the ducklings with the box of eggs in which they started life A Waitrose spokesman said it was ""notoriously difficult"" to identify the sex of white-feathered ducks. ""Our farmers work hard to ensure ducks and drakes are separated correctly. As a result of this difficulty in sexing, a male white-feathered duck may very occasionally be left with a group of females, although, these instances are extremely rare. ""There may also be instances when a wild duck encounters farmed drakes, but again, this is rare,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: ""It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched. But we acknowledge that it's not impossible.""

Our colleagues in Singapore will be resuming live coverage at 0500 BST on Monday. Authorities in Sri Lanka have held mock elections as part of a test of new anti-coronavirus voting measures. Voters wore face masks, stood 1m (3ft) apart in queues and brought their own pens and pencils to mark ballot papers. Officials were protected by plastic screens or face shields, and sprayed disinfectants on voters. Sri Lanka postponed parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for April, because of the virus. The vote is due to be held on 5 August. Sunday's trial run was held in four of the country's 22 electoral districts. It was designed to get voters used to the new system and see if extra voting time was needed. Read more here The Indian government has called an urgent meeting of the leaders of the country's main political parties to discuss the coronavirus crisis in Delhi. The meeting, which will be held tomorrow, comes after India reported almost 12,000 new cases in 24 hours. Delhi's hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, with reports of people dying after being repeatedly turned away from different hospitals. It's estimated the health system will need tens of thousands more beds in the coming weeks in order to deal with the virus, which hasn't yet peaked. About 500 railway carriages are going to be converted into Covid wards. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Indian hospitals struggle to cope with the outbreak Katy AustinBusiness Correspondent From Monday, all non-essential retailers will be allowed to reopen in England. But not all shops will raise the shutters on day one - the
reopening will be gradual. For many, itâs an important opportunity to
welcome customers back to spend in store. Having spent time and money preparing
safety measures in line with âCovid-secureâ guidelines, they are hoping
shoppers have the confidence to return, and that they follow rules on queuing
and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity. However, businesses
Iâve spoken to expect much lower levels of trade overall in the coming months,
compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit
the number of customers in store - another is that the experience will be
different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no taking a
break inside a cafe or restaurant, while hospitality venues remain closed to
sit-in customers. The lockdown also accelerated change that had already begun: A move towards more online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be
needed in future. Thousands of people formed a socially distanced human chain in Berlin today to protest against racism, while observing coronavirus guidance. The chain stretched from the Brandenburg Gate, past the old East Berlin television tower, and into NeukÃ¶lln district. Political parties, climate change campaigners and other activist groups - including Grannies Against the Far Right - took part in protest events in several German cities. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. You are likely to see them in other shops too, such as bookseller Waterstones and Boots, the UK's biggest pharmacy chain. Some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - will be in place to try to reduce the virus spread. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones says it will ""quarantine"" books for 72 hours after people have touched them. The number of customers allowed in stores will also be limited, and businesses have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,external. But despite these precautions, many shoppers are feeling anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The daily coronavirus death toll reported by the government tells you how many deaths were recorded that day - not how many actually happened. So we expect to see lower figures at weekends. Even accounting for the Sunday effect though, todayâs figure of 36 deaths in all settings across the UK is hopeful - itâs the lowest daily figure seen since before lockdown. Last Sunday, the grim toll was down to 55 and, the week before that, 111 Covid deaths were recorded. But the day before lockdown when recorded deaths were last at this level, it took under a fortnight for this figure to have increased ten-fold. The outbreak escalated with frightening speed and came down much more slowly. With further relaxations to lockdown kicking in from Monday, scientists and government will be keeping a sharp eye on these figures in the hope that another uncontrollable escalation can be prevented. As face coverings become mandatory on public transport in England from tomorrow, we've been listening to what you have to say. Christine Bithrey, from London, told us she has chronic asthma and that wearing a mask makes it feel harder for her to breathe. In a government briefing earlier this month, transport minister Grant Shapps said people with breathing difficulties would be exempt from the new law. Christine is currently working from home but she doesn't want to use public transport, because as her condition is hidden, she fears she will be attacked or stopped for not wearing a mask. ""I am terrified about the prospect of using public transport"", she says. ""A couple of weeks ago I went on a bus to a different location, and I was coughing because of my asthma. I am nearly 60.
A man appeared in front of me with a disgusting tissue and asked me to put it over my mouth."" But Christine says she will need to travel to work at some point. ""I have no idea how I am going to get to my office,"" she says.
""I spoke to some staff at Camden Road station who said they weren't even aware of any exemptions.
If London Transport Police approaches me, how can I prove I have a health condition?"" Australia's two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, have announced their latest plans to ease lockdown restrictions. NSW officials have said the 50-person limit at funerals will be lifted immediately, while nightclubs and music festivals will be allowed to operate from August if new cases of coronavirus remain low. Meanwhile in Victoria, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated customers at a time - an increase from the current limit of 20 - from 22 June. Restaurants in parts of the country, including Sydney, had already reopened earlier this month. Australia has had 7,320 confirmed cases, and a total death toll of 102. There's a festive atmosphere at London Zoo ahead of its reopening tomorrow, and the gorillas have had bunting put up in their treehouses as they prepare to greet fans once again. The zoo closed in March when the UK went into lockdown. When it reopens on Monday, there'll be limits on visitor numbers, one-way routes, and paw-print-shaped social distancing markers. Daniel Simmonds, team leader of the zoo's primates, told Reuters news agency the gorillas ""have already adjusted to the fact that people haven't been coming in, but equally I am absolutely sure they are going to be really excited when they see lots of friendly visitor faces visiting them tomorrow"". Almost 11,000 Germans will be arriving in Spain's Balearic islands next week as part of a scheme helping to boost the tourism industry after it was ground to a halt by the coronavirus pandemic. They will start landing on Monday and most will stay on the largest island, Mallorca. However a smaller number will head to Ibiza and Menorca. So who are the lucky ones? Spanish news outlet El Mundo has declared them ""false tourists"", as they are industry professionals, such as travel agents and hotel owners, rather than random holidaymakers. Their trip is a test run, so others can hopefully follow in their footsteps. The visitors will be exempt from virus testing and mandatory two-week quarantines, which are in force across mainland Spain. But they will have to fill out a form, have their temperatures taken on arrival, and provide authorities with their contact details and accommodation addresses so they can be traced if necessary. Tourism is a vital industry for the islands, accounting for approximately a third of the region's economy. But unlike their German counterparts, Spaniards are still prohibited from visiting anywhere but their home regions. Spain was initially set to reopen its borders to other EU countries from 1 July. But this weekend Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said this will be moved to a week earlier. The 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas travellers to Spain will also expire on 21 June. The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan could more than double by the end of this month and peak at 1.2 million a month later, the country's planning minister Asad Umar has warned. Pakistan currently has almost 140,000 confirmed cases and its death toll is more than 2,600. However, because testing remains limited, it's thought that the real numbers are higher. ""Expert estimates say the number of confirmed cases could go up to 300,000 by the end of June if we keep on flouting SOPs [standard operating procedures] and taking the problem lightly,"" said Umar. He issued the warning as people reportedly ignore guidance on social distancing and hygiene measures to stem the spread of the virus. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon hopes to allow more social interaction this week Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she remains optimistic that she will be able to announce to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the country is ready to move into phase two of easing lockdown measures, and that people in the ""shielded"" group will be able to go outdoors for exercise. The first minister said at today's briefing that she may announce a partial move, rather than a complete move to phase two. She said this could allow more social interaction, the re-mobilisation of the NHS, and would indicate when the retail sector might reopen. The first minister also stressed the importance of social distancing, and said the two-metre rule would remain under review, but would only be reduced if it was deemed safe to do so. Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was killed recently As some coronavirus restrictions have been eased in South Africa there has been a surge in violence against women, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. He called it a ""dark and shameful week"" for his country. Several women have been killed, including Tshegofatso Pule - who was eight months pregnant when she was found stabbed and hanging from a tree. Among the restrictions that have been lifted recently are a ban on the sale of alcohol. ""Gender-based violence thrives in a climate of silence. With our silence, by looking the other way because we believe it is a personal or family matter, we become complicit in this most insidious of crimes,"" the president said. Read the full storyhere. Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line withnew World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport. Elsewhere in the UK:  Read more here  The Visual and Data Journalism Team As we reported earlier, the UK today saw its lowest rise in the number of people who died after testing positive for coronavirus (36) since 22 March, though figures tend to be lower at the weekend due to reporting delays. Here's a look at how the UK's outbreak is changing, in charts. Next week US President Donald Trump is planning to hold an election rally in the US city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. But Tulsa's public health director, Bruce Dart, says he is concerned about the risks it poses due to the national outbreak of coronavirus. âI think itâs an honour for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,â Dr Dart told local outlet Tulsa World. Oklahoma and Tulsa County reported a record increase in infections on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. As of Saturday, more than 8,000 cases and 359 deaths have been confirmed across the state. âCovid is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,â Dr Dart said. âI wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isnât as large a concern as it is today. âIâm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and Iâm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well,â he added. A 70-year-old man who nearly died of coronavirus has reportedly been handed a $1.1m (Â£876,000) medical bill in the US. The Seattle Times reported that Michael Flor racked up the bill after needing 62 days of hospital treatment. Flor was so seriously ill that at one point nurses held up a phone for him so he could say goodbye to his wife and children. The 181-page bill totalled $1,122,501.04. However, Flor shouldn't have to dig into his own pockets as he is covered by Medicare, a government insurance program for the elderly. ""It was a million bucks to save my life, and of course I'd say that's money well-spent ... But I also know I might be the only one saying that,"" he told the Times. Ione WellsBBC News Jan Maddox has not been able to see her partner since the day before lockdown For people living alone the risks of loneliness in lockdown are significantly greater, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. In England, adults living alone or single parents canform a ""support bubble"" with another household- but that's not the case in Wales. Jan Maddox, 71, is from Newport in south Wales but her partner lives in the Midlands. She is one of nearly eight million people in the UK who live alone. ""For the last three months, the only living thing I've touched is a dog,"" she says. ""I did have a terrific social life. I was always out with friends, pub quizzes, music - everything. That all stopped. It's been a very lonely time."" Read more. A further 36 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the
total number of deaths to 41,698,
according to figures from the Department of Health. The figures include deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. This is the lowest
daily rise in the UK since 22 March, when 35 deaths were recorded. However, figures
tend to be lower at the weekend, due to reporting delays. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
How will secondary schools reopen safely?A secondary head describes her plans to bring pupils back to school and keep the virus at bay.Family & Education,"'Safety measures are key', says Rachel Hutchinson, principal of Ivybridge Community College As some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils in England prepare to go back to school on Monday, secondary head teachers are having to overcome an array of challenges. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements will vary widely. More than 300 schools and colleges told us they were mainly offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Some are making the return gradual, starting with pupils who are struggling the most, with many providing individual pastoral sessions to check on mental health. The Sixth Form Colleges Association says schools and colleges should ensure that extending face-to-face teaching does not impact on support for pupils who are still at home. Heads mount 'military operations' for exam pupils When will secondary schools go back? At Ivybridge Community College on the southern slopes of Dartmoor in Devon, principal Rachel Hutchinson has been putting the final touches to plans for welcoming back just over a quarter of the college's 2,500 students. The Year 10 and 12 pupils who will be doing their GCSEs and A-levels next year will return to a very different school from the one they last saw in March. ""Safety measures are key,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. ""We're working very much with social distancing measures... looking very much at the timetable and what we can do safely and sensibly."" But she's also determined to give them an ""effective education"". Pupils arrive by school bus, public bus and train, some are dropped off, while others walk or cycle. New mask-wearing and social distancing rules on public transport, plus a ban on sixth-formers car sharing, mean clear communication is key, she says. Each school bus can now carry just seven students, which means that, while bringing back a quarter of the pupils is feasible, larger numbers might be impossible, she says. At Ivybridge, even these smaller numbers of students will have to be part-time to ensure safety. It means only about 100 will be in at any one time, with only 10 in each class. For Year 10s, there will be one full day of teaching each week, with 90 minutes each of maths, English and science. The other subjects will continue to be taught remotely on the days pupils are at home. ""They'll still get their full curriculum,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Social distancing rules mean there can only be about 10 pupils in each classroom The post-16 students will have seminar days to reduce movement around the site. They'll get two full days of each A-level over the five weeks before the end of term, says Mrs Hutchinson. ""We think it's very viable, its do-able and it's really important for their education."" There are 2m distancing markers along all the corridors and a one-way system. Staff in high-vis jackets will monitor every entrance, there are hand-sanitising stations and lots of posters and banners to remind children not to crowd each other. ""It's going to be that supermarket feel - when you go to a supermarket for the first time with the trolley queues,"" she says. With reduced numbers, it's manageable, she says, but increased numbers of students would present a challenge. Social distancing plans are in place for break times too ""I'd like to think as a college we've been really strong on our pastoral care,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Tutors have had lots of email contact with students, with fun, remote activities like cake-baking to keep pupils engaged with the school community. However, she recognises some will have fallen behind and so there is a recovery programme to help them catch up. She says a key aim of returning to school is to ensure pupils' wellbeing and she will keep a particular eye out for socially disadvantaged children. About 30 children have opted to take up the college's offer of one-to-one tutoring, with support available for families who have suffered bereavement or illness or are anxious, she says. The college has run reopening induction sessions for staff One of the most important aspects is ""getting it right for my staff"", she says. ""They are absolutely working round the clock to maintain communication, the pastoral welfare and wellbeing of the children, as well as checking in on the learning."" Some have their own health issues, many will be running busy households without childcare and may feel anxious about returning to face-to-face teaching. ""It's managing staff welfare and making sure that staff feel safe and are ready to come back to work,"" she says. Years 7, 8 and 9 will continue to be taught virtually and pupils in Years 11 and 13, whose exams were cancelled will still get support. ""It's keeping an eye on a number of schools really; our virtual school as well as the new school that's going to be returning. ""The exciting thing is, for the first time ever, children are saying they miss school,"" says Mrs Hutchinson. Getting the college back to a ""new normal for September,"" is another challenge. It will be welcoming the new Year 7s, plus a huge group who have not been in school since March. Mrs Hutchinson says that unless the distancing measures are amended, schools will have to run a blend of classroom lessons and virtual learning in September. She believes the idea of schools opening over the summer, when staff have already been flat out since March is ""quite controversial"". ""The summer six weeks are going to be key for us to get ready for September,"" she argues - and many staff will have to work through to prepare. ""So to open for children in as well will be incredibly challenging,"" she says. She hopes both children and teachers can take their normal summer holidays, ready for a new start, whatever form it will take. Wales will begin opening schools on 29 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland waiting until August.

Shops get ready to reopen their doors,"""It's very exciting, we can't wait to have our customers back,"" says Annie Martin, who manages the Waterstones Piccadilly bookshop, in London. Non-essential retailers, such as fashion, toy and book shops, will be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June - as long as they have coronavirus-related safety measures in place. Waterstones, for example, is introducing Perspex ""sneeze screens"" and a quarantine trolley where books that have been browsed will be held for ""a couple of days"". ""We want to keep bookshop experience exactly as it normally would be,"" says Annie. ""We're still encouraging people to browse, we're just looking after those books once you've browsed them."" Annie has been working on implementing those changes behind-the-scenes, but is also looking forward to seeing her colleagues back in-store. ""Bookshops are quite close teams... We've been messaging, but it's not quite the same as seeing colleagues in person for a chat, particularly about the books you've been reading on furlough."" When will shops open and what will the rules be? Special offers 'pulled from shelves during lockdown' 'Your High Street is back open for business' Suki, who works at a Boots beauty hall in London, also says that it's ""refreshing to come back to work, which is like my second home"". Most Boots stores have remained open during lockdown. That means that staff on the beauty counter have had the chance to trial different ways of working about a week before shoppers return to the High Street. Boots is removing all make-up testers, and assistants will wear plastic visors in its beauty halls, to try to keep both customers and staff safe. Suki acknowledges that some changes could make shopping more difficult. That there won't be testers is ""going to be a shock for a lot of us, because with beauty you often need to try things on,"" she said. ""The visor isn't the most glamorous thing in the world, but it does mean that I'm not touching my face and my make-up can stay on longer. And, safety isn't supposed to be glamorous,"" she adds. Overall, Suki feels as though she's in a safe pair of hands: ""We're all as nervous as each other, so I think as long as we all take the necessary steps, we'll be fine."" Shoppers, though, might be feeling more anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years,according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.,external One trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), is urging the public to ""play their part"" in making shopping safer. Along with 25 other retailers, it says customers should follow five steps: Queue considerately Maintain social distancing Follow instructions inside and outside shops Follow all necessary hygiene measures Be respectful to shop staff Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said: ""Every visit we make helps support jobs in retail, as well as throughout the supply chain. Retailers have been working around the clock to create a safe shopping environment"". ""Our shopping experience may be changing, but if we all follow the necessary social distancing measures and show a little consideration to those around us, then everyone will be better off."" Her plea was echoed by Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase. ""While the vast majority of our customers have adhered to the safety measures we have in store, in recent weeks, a small minority of shoppers are disobeying the guidelines set out and at times reacting abusively when challenged by store teams,"" he said. ""It's for this reason we're calling on members of the public to help us reverse the trend that saw cases of abusive incidents towards shop workers rise by 9% during the last year."" For any customers who don't want to go into a store, HMV will offer to do their shopping for them. From Monday, people can drop in a shopping list, a team member will collect it, package it up and have it waiting for the customer to pick up later. Alternatively, customers can ring their local HMV to have a product put aside for them to collect later on. The idea came from the chain's Canadian customers who have been a little bit more cautious about returning to stores as opposed to its US shoppers, says its owner Doug Putman. So what does he expect from customers in England when HMV opens 93 shops on Monday?Read more here. Many retailers in England will soon open their doors for the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown.Those in Northern Ireland have been open since Friday. John Lewis stores in Poole and Kingstonwill be the first to reopen on 15 June, followed by another 11 shops later that week. Marks & Spencer will also reopen the majority of its clothing stores. Primark has also announced that it will reopen,externalall 153 of its stores in England on Monday. This video can not be played Bluewater shopping centre prepares to reopen on 15 June Meanwhile, Debenhams will open 50 shops in England.The firm collapsed for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business. It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 of its stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted. It is still in discussions over a ""handful"" of others. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""The survival of so many retailers will hinge on the success of reopening stores over the coming weeks and the pace at which consumers return."" Mr Lim also pointed out that the ""significant shift"" towards online seen during lockdown may change shopping habits for good. ""Many of these consumers are shopping for goods online for the first time, overcoming the barriers of setting up online accounts, entering payment details and gaining trust. It is inevitable that some of these behaviours will become sticky,"" he said. Former John Lewis boss and current mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, told Sky News he hopes to see a permanent reform to business rates, a kind of council tax businesses pay. He is also keen on proposals for a digital sales tax for online retailers, ""making sure online companies pay a fair share,"" he said. For physical shops, a rare ray of sunshine from the lockdown could be customers wanting to visit local shops as they work from home and spend more time near their homes, he added. ""I do believe one of the things to come out of this is a concentration on local areas,"" he told Sky.

Fear of Beijing second wave after market outbreak,"Xinfadi is the biggest wholesale market in Beijing An area of the Chinese capital Beijing has been put under strict lockdown measures after the city's first coronavirus cases in more than 50 days. The outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market. A total of 45 people out of 517 tested at the Xinfadi market tested positive for Covid-19, a district official said. None was displaying symptoms. Lockdowns have been imposed in 11 nearby neighbourhoods, while 10,000 market staff will be tested. The authorities also want to test everyone who has had recent contact with the market as well as those living in the district surrounding it. These are the first new confirmed cases in Beijing for more than 50 days. Xinfadi market in the city's south-western Fengtai district was shut down in the early hours of Saturday, after two men who had recently visited the market were reported to have Covid-19. Tests at the market then showed 45 people had the virus. Thousands who work at the market are now being tested ""In accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,"" Chu Junwei, a district official, told a briefing. The district is in a ""wartime emergency mode"", he added. Hundreds of military police have entered the now locked-down facility. Nearby transport links and schools have been closed. What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? Right across Beijing sport has been cancelled and major public facilities are pulling down the shutters again. There will now be fears of a second wave of the virus in the capital. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China's coronavirus outbreak was brought under control through some of the world's strictest lockdown measures after the disease was detected in the city of Wuhan. More than 4,600 people in China have lost their lives to the coronavirus out of around 426,000 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University. Chinese officials aren't sure how the huge Xinfandi wholesale market - which supplies 80% of Beijing's vegetables and meat - has become the source of a new coronavirus outbreak. In recent months the Chinese government's strategy has been to completely isolate any town or city where a coronavirus cluster has emerged. This appears to have worked but locking down all of Beijing, at time when it seemed like the virus emergency had been brought under control, is not something they'll want to do in a hurry.

""The summer six weeks are going to be key for us to get ready for September,"" she argues - and many staff will have to work through to prepare. ""So to open for children in as well will be incredibly challenging,"" she says. She hopes both children and teachers can take their normal summer holidays, ready for a new start, whatever form it will take. Wales will begin opening schools on 29 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland waiting until August.

Australian man sentenced to death in China,"The Australian man was reportedly arrested with methamphetamine in his luggage An Australian man has been sentenced to death in China for drug smuggling, the Australian government has confirmed. The man was named in Australian media,externalas Karm or Cam Gilespie. He is believed to have been arrested at an airport in 2013 with 7.5kg (16 Ibs) of methamphetamine, also known as ice, in his luggage, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reports. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was ""deeply saddened to hear of the verdict"". ""Australia opposes the death penalty, in all circumstances for all people. We support the universal abolition of the death penalty and are committed to pursuing this goal through all the avenues available to us,"" it said in a statement. Relations between China and Australia have been strained by trade disputes and mutual criticism during the coronavirus pandemic. Australia angered China by calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. China rejects calls for inquiry into virus origins Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities Beijing subsequently warned citizens against travelling to Australia, saying there had been a ""significant increase"" in racist attacks on Asian people, andtold Chinese students to consider the risks of studying there.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would ""never be intimidated by threats"". Karm Gilespie is thought to have been arrested seven years ago while trying to board an international flight from Baiyun Airport in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. Chinese media reports say the death sentence was announced by the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on 10 June. China refuses to disclose how many people it executes. Rights group Amnesty International believes thousands are killed every year. The sentence is carried out by lethal injection or by firing squad. At least a dozen foreigners have been executed for drug-related offences, and many more are on death row. One of the most high-profile cases involvedBritish man Akmal Shaikh, who was executed in 2009,externaldespite claims he was mentally ill and an appeal for clemency from the UK prime minister. Australians have been sentenced to death previously, including Bengali Sherrif in 2015. Sherrif was arrested at Guangzhou airport after trying to smuggle methamphetamine between China and Australia. At the time, Australia's public broadcaster said Sherrif's death sentence could be softened to life in prison after two years of good behaviour. Australia also expressed concern whenCanadian citizen Robert Schellenberg was handed a death sentence in January 2019. Robert Schellenberg denies trying to smuggling methamphetamine from China to Australia Prosecutors allege that he tried to smuggle almost 227kg (500lb) of methamphetamine from Dalian, in northern China, to Australia. Schellenberg denied all charges and said he has been framed. Canadian's death sentence in China 'horrific', family says Simon Birmingham - who was then acting foreign minister and is now Australia's trade minister - said at the time that the country was ""deeply concerned"" by the case.

Equality changes pledged after Bristol BLM protest,"The statue of Edward Colston was pushed into the harbour after being toppled by protesters Pledges have been made by police, the council and community leaders aimed at bringing about long-term change in Bristol following the Black Lives Matter protest that saw a statue of Edward Colston toppled. Protesterstore down the statue of the 17th Century slave traderand pushed it into the city's harbour, in one of the most symbolic moments of a series of demonstrations around the country. An estimated 10,000 people had gathered in Bristol to demonstrate last weekend and manysaid the events felt empoweringbut they hoped for real change in the city. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees has commissioned research into the city's history in a pledge to better understand its story, while other pledges made include updating the school curriculum and efforts to improve BAME representation within the police force. The statue wasrecovered on Thursday morningfrom Bristol's harbour and is set to become a museum exhibit, alongside protestors' placards from the demonstration. Marvin Rees said a commission of historians would be set up to research the city's ""true history"" Mr Rees, Bristol's mayor since 2016, said: ""The events over the last few days have really highlighted as a city we all have very different understandings of our past. ""The only way we can work together on our future is by learning the truth of our beginnings, embracing the facts, and sharing those stories with others. ""Bristol's journey to become the modern city it is today includes a history of huge disparities of class, race and gender and the struggles for equality."" Following many calls for schools' curriculums to better reflect the culture, literature and history of black communities, Joanne Jefferson, head of English and associate head teacher at St Katherine's School in Pill, Bristol, said the school would be leading on cultural awareness and inclusion in September. Joanne Jefferson will be helping lead her school with its cultural awareness programme She said the protests had inspired the school to ""evaluate everything"" about its teaching. ""White privilege and what it means is one of the first things that we are educating our young people on, because there are elements of mainstream media and people in society that think it's a made up thing. It's not - it exists,"" Mrs Jefferson said. ""One of the things we are trying to do as a school is to encourage our young people to put themselves in somebody else's shoes."" Mrs Jefferson and two of her black colleagues recorded a video conversation about the issues to show pupils ""it's OK to talk about race"". The school has launched a reading challenge to ""promote black fiction, political fiction and anti-racist fiction"" and encourage teachers ""to educate themselves"" on race. Liza Bilal was a part of the Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol Liza Bilal, 21, one of the organisers of the city's protest, has pledged to lobby the government into reviewing positive discrimination under the Equality Act. She said: ""It is so companies are actively hiring, and filling their boards with, black and brown people. ""Martin Luther King said 'protests and riots are the expression of the unheard', so if change doesn't occur and we don't see it soon there will be more protests."" Desmond Brown said this was a defining moment for the city Desmond Brown, chair of the local group ofthe Lammy Review, investigating racial bias in the criminal justice system, said he had collected data on how decisions were made at each point of a person's journey through the system, to understand where any bias was and then challenge it.. He pledge to create a framework, working with people in independent advisory and community groups, that would see information flow between the community and police so pressing issues could be raised. And Mr Brown said he would offer workshops to help young black people ""survive encounters with the criminal justice system"", access help and not become criminalised. ""This is a defining moment and if we don't see change here, I don't think we are going to go back to quiet times,"" said Mr Brown. ""I think the rage in young people across the board, black and white male and female is - enough is enough now."" The Avon and Somerset Police Outreach team says its diversity champions will support people interested in joining the force A spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset Police's outreach team described an ambitious vision ""to be the UK's most inclusive police force"". She said: ""We currently don't represent the communities we serve and so this needs to change. ""Our continuing work with the Black Police Association ensures those of a black and minority ethnic background within the service are treated fairly."" 'It's all been built upon racist acts' The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Schools consider dropping Colston name The force has been certified by the National Equality Standard and achieved accreditation for best practice in equality, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace. It has diversity champions who support people from under represented backgrounds who are interested in joining the police. Protesters knelt on the neck of the bronze statue of Colston, which is destined to be a museum exhibit The University of Bristol has committed to reviewing the names of its buildings and logo. A spokesman said: ""The Black Lives Matter campaign has served to amplifyexisting concerns about the university's historyand whether we should rename the Wills Memorial Building, and other buildings named after families with links to the slave trade.""

Fear of Beijing second wave after market outbreakParts of China's capital are locked down after its first new coronavirus cases in nearly two months.China,"Xinfadi is the biggest wholesale market in Beijing An area of the Chinese capital Beijing has been put under strict lockdown measures after the city's first coronavirus cases in more than 50 days. The outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market. A total of 45 people out of 517 tested at the Xinfadi market tested positive for Covid-19, a district official said. None was displaying symptoms. Lockdowns have been imposed in 11 nearby neighbourhoods, while 10,000 market staff will be tested. The authorities also want to test everyone who has had recent contact with the market as well as those living in the district surrounding it. These are the first new confirmed cases in Beijing for more than 50 days. Xinfadi market in the city's south-western Fengtai district was shut down in the early hours of Saturday, after two men who had recently visited the market were reported to have Covid-19. Tests at the market then showed 45 people had the virus. Thousands who work at the market are now being tested ""In accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,"" Chu Junwei, a district official, told a briefing. The district is in a ""wartime emergency mode"", he added. Hundreds of military police have entered the now locked-down facility. Nearby transport links and schools have been closed. What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? Right across Beijing sport has been cancelled and major public facilities are pulling down the shutters again. There will now be fears of a second wave of the virus in the capital. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China's coronavirus outbreak was brought under control through some of the world's strictest lockdown measures after the disease was detected in the city of Wuhan. More than 4,600 people in China have lost their lives to the coronavirus out of around 426,000 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University. Chinese officials aren't sure how the huge Xinfandi wholesale market - which supplies 80% of Beijing's vegetables and meat - has become the source of a new coronavirus outbreak. In recent months the Chinese government's strategy has been to completely isolate any town or city where a coronavirus cluster has emerged. This appears to have worked but locking down all of Beijing, at time when it seemed like the virus emergency had been brought under control, is not something they'll want to do in a hurry.
