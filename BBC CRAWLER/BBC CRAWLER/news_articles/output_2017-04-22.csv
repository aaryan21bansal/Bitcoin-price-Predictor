How many people are registering to vote?,"This video can not be played Don't get left outside on polling day - here's how to register to vote More than two million people have applied to vote in the month since Theresa May announced she wanted to hold a snap general election on 8 June. The highest number of registrations so far was on 18 April, the day Theresa May fired the election starting gun, when 147,000 people registered and 3,364 paper forms were submitted. This was the biggest total recorded for a single day since the EU referendum campaign in 2016. And the number of young people registering is the highest of any age group. The deadline to register for the 2017 general election is 23.59 GMT on Monday 22 May. General election: What you need to know Although numbers began to drop off a little after an initial flurry in mid-April, there are still significant numbers of voters making sure they can have their say at the ballot box. In six out of the seven days up to 19 April, registrations exceeded 100,000 a day. There had already been a steady stream of voters signing up ahead of the local elections being held on 4 May. A spike in the numbers on 7 April, which saw 84,600 people register in one day, has been attributed to a Facebook reminder that went out to users across the UK. The next highest day was 12 April, when 30,700 registered - a day before the registration deadline for the local elections. But on 16 April, two days before the general election was announced and after the deadline had passed for the locals, the number was down to just 5,661. After campaigning to get more people registered in time for the last general election in 2015 and the EU referendum in 2016, the Electoral Commission said the deadline to register was ""a significant motivating factor"", with a spokeswoman adding: ""A large number of people apply to register in the days immediately before and on the deadline itself."" The biggest group getting their applications in to vote during this surge is young people. Rachael Farrington, university student andfounder of Voting Counts,external- a campaign to encourage voters to register - said the general election was a chance for young people to have their say. ""I think it is so easy to fall into the habit of not voting,"" she said on her blog. ""Many don't really see how politics affects them or their lives on a day to day basis. ""To this I'd say think about what you care about, is it the education of yourself or children, the local community spaces, healthcare, or jobs in your local community? ""Usually, whatever issue it is that you care about is influenced by politics in some way, so you should at least vote so that you have a say in making sure that issue is dealt with in a way you see fit."" On the day the general election was called, 57,987 people under 25 registered to vote - more than any other age group. The second largest group was people aged between 25 and 34, with a further 51,341 registering. The number of new registrations declined the older people got: 19,321 people aged between 35 to 44 registered 10,224 people aged between 45 and 54 registered 6,410 people aged between 55 and 64 registered 3,676 people aged between 65 and 74 registered 1,215 people aged over 75 registered The previous Facebook-related spike on 7 April actually saw the 25-to-34 group with the most registrations - 31,211 people - but this was followed in second by the under-25s, with 22,138 registrations. Just 3,175 people 65 or over registered on that day. Emma Hartley, head of campaigns at the Electoral Commission, said: ""It's really encouraging that so many young people have registered to vote recently, as our research shows that along with students and recent home movers, they are particularly less likely to be registered."" But with another month until voter registration closes, there is more to be done to get people to their polling stations on 8 June. Mariam Inayat Waseem, trustee and director of the British Youth Council and a student at Newcastle University, said: ""You only have to go onto social media to see how politically engaged young people are, but they are not involved in traditional ways. ""Young people feel disillusioned. Decisions about their futures are being made by people without them being part of the conversation. ""These decisions being taken by politicians are going to affect us, the young people, way more than they will those people who are implementing them, so we need to go out and vote and make our voices heard.""

The MPs who are quitting,"The surprise election on 8 June has brought things into sharp focus for MPs looking for a way out of politics - and offers a possible way back for their former colleagues wanting to return. Some of the big names stepping down includeGeorge OsborneandSir Eric Pickles, whileTony Blairand Wikileaks founderJulian Assangeare among the more surprising names to suggest, perhaps not entirely seriously, that they are thinking of standing. George Osborne The former chancellor once feted as the likely successor to David Cameron as prime minister has announced hewill not seek re-electionas Conservative MP for Tatton, Cheshire. Mr Osborne was sacked as chancellor after Theresa May became the party's new leader in July. He has since become the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper as well as taking a job for the fund manager BlackRock, among others, prompting calls for him to stand down. Announcing his decision not to seek re-election, the 45-year-old said he was stepping down ""for now"". Sir Eric Pickles Former Conservative Party chairman Sir Eric Pickles, 65,is standing down as MP for Brentwood and Ongarafter 25 years. Sir Eric, who had been the communities and local government secretary between 2010 and 2015, said he was going to ""miss it dreadfully"" but there always came a point when things must end. Andrew Tyrie The long-standing chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, who has locked horns withBoris Johnson,HMRCandBank of England governor Mark Carney, will quit his safe Conservative seat. Mr Tyrie, 60, said it had been an ""exhilarating"" 20 years as MP for Chichester in West Sussex but that he was ""hopefully young enough"" to contribute to public service in other ways. Douglas Carswell Douglas Carswell, UKIP's first elected MP who later became an independent after falling out with senior figures in the party,will not be seeking re-election in Clacton. Instead, the political maverick will lend his support to the Conservatives, the party he defected from in 2014, causing political shockwaves at the time. Farewell to an independent-minded MP Alan Johnson Regarded by some in Westminster as the best leader Labour never had,Alan Johnson is to stand downfrom the Hull West and Hessle seat he has held since 1997. Announcing his decision not to seek re-election, the former postman and union official who rose to become home secretary under Gordon Brown, said it was ""best for the party"". Gisela Stuart Labour's Birmingham Edgbaston MP, who was a key figure in the campaign to leave the EU, has decided not to seek re-election. Ms Stuart, who has represented the Midlands seat since 1997, told local supporters it was ""time to stand down and pass on the baton"". Andy Burnham Andy Burnham, a former Labour health secretary and now tipped as favourite to become Mayor of Greater Manchester, says he will not stand again in June. Mr Burnham, MP for Leigh for 16 years, had two shots at party leadership, coming fourth in 2010 and second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. Tom Blenkinsop - Labour (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) elected in 2010 Graham Allen - Labour (Nottingham North) elected in 1987 Iain Wright - Labour (Hartlepool) elected in 2004 Pat Glass - Labour (North West Durham) elected in 2010 Simon Burns - Conservative (Chelmsford) elected in 1987 John Pugh - Lib Dem (Southport) elected in 2001 Andrew Smith - Labour (Oxford East) elected in 1987 Angela Watkinson - Conservative (Hornchurch and Upminster) elected in 2001 Jim Dowd - Labour (Lewisham West and Penge) elected in 1992 Fiona Mactaggart - Labour (Slough) elected in 1997 Rob Marris - Labour (Wolverhampton South West) elected in 2015 Sir Gerald Howarth - Conservative (Aldershot) elected in 1997 Dave Anderson - Labour (Blaydon) elected in 2005 Michael Dugher - Labour (Barnsley East) elected in 2010 Michelle Thomson - Independent (Edinburgh West). Ms Thomson was elected as SNP MP in 2015, but resigned the party whip amid a police probe into property deals. After being rejected for SNP selection, she said she would not stand again at this time Sir Alan Haselhurst - Conservative (Saffron Walden) elected in 1977 David Mackintosh - Conservative (Northampton South) elected in 2015 Karen Lumley - Conservative (Redditch) elected in 2010 Andrew Turner - Conservative (Isle of Wight) elected in 2001 Zac Goldsmith The former Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith,has been re-selected as the party's candidatein Richmond Park. Goldsmithresigned from the partyand stood as an independent in a by-election before Christmas in protest at the government's decision to give the go-ahead to the expansion of Heathrow Airport. But he lost to the Liberal Democrats' Sarah Olney, who is standing for re-election. EstherMcVey The former employment minister, who was a TV presenter before entering Parliament, lost her Wirral West seat in 2015 to Labour's Margaret Greenwood (who is standing again). She has been selected to stand in George Osborne's former Tatton seat. Sir Vince Cable Sir Vince Cable, who served as former business secretary in the coalition government from 2010-2015, is one of a batch of Lib Dems who have confirmed they will stand again. A former Labour councillor, the 73-year-old was first elected as MP for Twickenham in 1997 but was defeated by Conservative Tania Mathias in 2015 after the Lib Dems lost dozens of seats. Ms Mathias is expected to stand again. Announcing his decision to stand again, Sir Vince said ""Bring it on!"". Sir Simon Hughes A former Lib Dem deputy leader and minister of state for justice and civil liberties in the coalition government, Sir Simon Hughes said he intends to be the party's candidate to fight the Bermondsey and Old Southwark seat in south London, which he lost to Labour's Neil Coyle in 2015. Mr Coyle is standing again. Sir Ed Davey Sir Ed Davey, 51, is another Lib Dem heavyweight to announce his return to the political fray. Confirming his intention to stand again for election in Kingston and Surbiton, the former energy secretary in the coalition government toldthe Independent,external: ""We will be the surprise in this election, we will do far better than people currently think."" The seat was won by Conservative James Berry in 2015, with a majority of 2,834. Mr Berry is standing again. Jo Swinson A former deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson was once Parliament's youngest MP, after she was elected to East Dunbartonshire in 2005, but was ousted in 2015 by the SNP's John Nicolson, who is standing for re-election. Sir Bob Russell The former Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, Sir Bob Russell,is to stand again, despite retiring from politics after his defeat in 2015 to Conservative Will Quince. Sir Nick Harvey Previously an armed forces minister, former Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Nick Harvey, 55, has told the BBC he will be seeking re-election after losing his seat in North Devon in 2015 to Conservative Peter Heaton-Jones. Ed Balls Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls will not be standing in the Morley and Outwood constituency he held for five years and is not expected to stand anywhere else. Mr Balls, who lost his seat in the 2015 general election, has arguably since become best known for his dance moves on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing, in whichhe became a fan favourite. Arron Banks The former UKIP donor was all set to take on Douglas Carswellin Clacton- the two are not the best of friends - but since Mr Carswell pulled out the insurance tycoon has had a change of heart. After visiting UKIP volunteers in the Essex seaside town - a place he cheerfully admitted he knew nothing about - he has said he has ""no intention of standing in the way of hard-working activists who are the soul of the party"". He will instead endorse local UKIP councillor Jeff Bray for the role and ""give the local party financial assistance to fight the election"". Nigel Farage The former UKIP leader briefly flirted with an eighth attempt to get elected to the House of Commons, saying he could have had an ""easy"" win in the former UKIP seat of Clacton, buthas thought better of it. He says he has more clout as a member of the European Parliament, where he will continue to ""fight for Brexit"". Karen Danczuk The ex-councillor and former wife of suspended Labour MP Simon Danczuk had applied to be Labour candidate for the Conservative-held Bury North seat. Ms Danczuk, dubbed the ""selfie queen"" by the tabloid press afterposting pictures of herself on Twitter, had said she was ""a voice of the people"". However, the party has chosen James Frith to stand for the seat, currently held by David Nuttall. Simon Danczuk The MP was suspended as a member of the Labour Party in 2015 over allegations about his private life. Heintended to stand for re-election as the party's candidate in Rochdalebut Labour had other ideas. A Labour spokesman said: ""After considering the case of Simon Danczuk in detail and speaking to him in an interview, the Labour Party's NEC endorsement panel unanimously recommended that he should not be endorsed as a Labour candidate."" Paul Nuttall The UKIP leader - who recently failed to take Stoke-on-Trent from Labour in a by-election - wavered for a few days but has now confirmedhe will stand in Boston and Skegness. The constituency, held by the Conservatives in 2015 with UKIP second, recorded the highest Leave vote in the EU referendum, with 75.6% choosing to leave the EU. Mr Nuttall said he would make it his ""mission"" to ""ensure there is no backsliding on Brexit"". Jack Monroe The food blogger and campaigner Jack Monroewill stand for the National Health Action Partyin Southend West, against Conservative Sir David Amess. Announcing theplan on Twitter,,externalthe activist said: ""Those who know me will know how much I fear meeting new people, which makes the next six weeks a huge personal challenge on every level... ""...but some things are bigger than me, so today I'm digging deep and heading to Southend High St to meet campaigners fighting for our A&E."" Steve Rotherham Will Labour's candidate to be Liverpool's first ""metro mayor"" - and a staunch ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - continue to sit as an MP if he wins 4 May's poll? His ultra-safe Liverpool Walton seat would be a prize for any aspiring Labour politician and there is a row brewing locally about a candidate being ""parachuted in"" by the party's London HQ. Tony Blair He won three elections while leader of the Labour Party, before stepping down in 2007, but could Tony Blair - now 63 - be making a big political comeback in this snap election? The former MP for Sedgefield - and prominent Remainer - got tongues waggingduring an exclusive interview with BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, after he admitted there was a temptation to get back into Westminster politics to fight against a hard Brexit. ""I feel for the first time since I first came into politics, I look at the British political scene at the moment and I actually almost feel motivated to go right back into it,"" he said. In an interview marking the 20th anniversary of his 1997 election victory, he later told The Observer that he wanted to ""reconnect with voters"" and ""get his hands dirty"" again but insisted he would not be a candidate in June. David Miliband There has been speculation about whether David Miliband might return to politics after stepping down as an MP in 2013. The former foreign secretary under Gordon Brown, who was surprisingly defeated by his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest, declined to rule out a return to UK politics in an interview withthe Times,externalin February. Julian Assange The Wikileaks founder may have been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, but has still suggested, perhaps light-heartedly, that he could stand in the election. Mr Assangetweeted,external: ""I can run for Parliament in any constituency in the UK. Ha ha. So which one?""

How many children are in classes over 30?,"The claim:Speaking in Swindon, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Half a million children are now being taught in super-size classes of over 36."" Reality Check verdict:This is incorrect. Actually about 42,000 pupils are in classes of 36 or more - about 1% of children. Mr Corbyn appears to be confusing statistics.  It is right, as the earlier Labour press release said, to say about half a million pupils in state-funded primary schools in England are in classes of between 31 and 35. Labour claims that pupils in England's primary schools ""are packed like sardines"" in classrooms. Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech in Swindon on Friday: ""Half a million children are now being taught in super-size classes of over 36."" This is at odds with what his party's press release said, which was that half a million children in state-funded primary schools are in classes between 31 and 35 pupils. That's about 12% of primary school pupils. That figure is confirmed by governmentfigures from the school census (see tables 6a and 6b),external, which also says that about 42,000 pupils are in classes of 36 pupils or more, which is about 1% of primary school pupils. Government rules say no infant school child should be taught in a class size greater than 30 - that's children in Key Stage 1 who are aged five to seven. That rule can be waived in exceptional circumstances - usually if twins or siblings are admitted to the school, or a child in care has to be given a place. The official school census for 2016 shows that more than half of Key Stage 1 classes with one teacher have either 29 or 30 pupils in them. Of the infant classes with more than 30 pupils, roughly 95% have 31 or 32 pupils. Classes with more than 32 children in them are uncommon. Rules on classes sizes do not apply to children in Key Stage 2, which is ages seven to 11. Between 2006 and 2016, the average Key Stage 1 class grew from 25.6 to 27.4 but at Key Stage 2, where there is no cap on numbers, it has remained stable at around 27 pupils in a class on average. While numbers of pupils in oversized classes has increased, the number of primary school aged children has increased by about half a million over that period. Since 2010, the proportion of children in classes of 31 to 35 pupils has risen from 10.6% to 11.9%.

County Championship - Yorkshire under pressure,"Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow fall cheaply for Yorkshire Alastair Cook goes for 14 as Essex struggle against Middlesex Nottinghamshire beat Sussex by an innings and 88 runs Worcestershire defeat Northants by 20 runs at New Road England batsman Keaton Jennings makes 87 for Durham Paul Grunill It's been quite a day - with Nottinghamshire and Worcestershire wrapping up two-day victories in Division Two. At least Stuart Broad and Moeen Ali ended up on the winning side, but there won't be many more happy faces among the other England players involved in the current round of Championship matches. Keaton Jennings scored 87 for Durham, but fell short of a hundred, and Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed were all dismissed cheaply. Champions Middlesex have Essex in some trouble at Lord's, and it's a similar situation facing Yorkshire against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl. How will things develop? Join us again tomorrow from about 10:30 BST to find out. Division One Hampshire 455 v Yorkshire 128-6 Hampshire lead by 327 runs Lancashire 109 & 152-2 v Somerset 278 Somerset lead by 17 runs Middlesex 507-7 dec v Essex 120-4 Middlesex lead by 387 runs Warwickshire 332 v Surrey 299-3 Warwickshire lead by 33 runs Division Two Gloucestershire 303 v Durham 270-4 Gloucestershire lead by 33 runs Kent 259 & 142-7 v Derbyshire 159 Kent lead by 242 runs Leicestershire 420 v Glamorgan 281-4 Leicestershire lead by 139 runs Nottinghamshire 447 v Sussex 155 & 204 Notts (24 pts) beat Sussex (3 pts) by an innings and 88 runs Worcestershire 188 & 153 v Northamptonshire 157 & 164 Worcestershire (19 pts) beat Northants (3 pts) by 20 runs Middlesex 507 dec v Essex 120-4 The hosts piled on the runs courtesy of Stevie Eskinazi (100) and John Simpson (90) before declaring and leaving Essex a difficult final period to overcome.Â Middlesex chipped away with regular wickets then to confirm their dominance. Toby Roland-Jones (2-43) had former England Test captain Alastair Cook caught behind, while Steven Finn bowled Tom Westley for 31. But it was the late wickets of Nick Browne (47) - lbw to Ollie Rayner - and nightwatchman Jamie Porter - bowled by Roland-Jones - that really capped a fine day.Â Unbeaten batsmen Dan Lawrence (10) and Ravi Bopara will be under pressure from the start tomorrow, with a deficit of 387 looming. Â Middlesex 507 dec v Essex 120-4 Nightwatchman Jamie Porter hasn't done much good at Lord's. He struck a four off his second ball, but Toby Roland-Jones has the last laugh, bowling him three balls later.Â Ravi Bopara comes to the crease for the final over.Â Worcestershire 188 & 153 beat Northants 157 & 164 by 20 runs Northamptonshire's run of five successive Championship wins - three at the end of last season, two at the start of this - comes to an end as Worcestershire skipper Joe Leach takes the 40th wicket to fall in two days at New Road and give his side their second victory of the summer. Leach has last man Andy Carter lbw to finish with 5-62 and match figures of 10-122, the first time he has taken 10 in a match. Teenager Josh Tongue, though, deserves his share of the plaudits after claiming 4-45, including the important wickets of Richard Levi and Josh Cobb. England's Moeen Ali was dismissed for a duck in Worcestershire's second innings - but his 50 on the opening day was the highest knock of a low-scoring contest. Â Middlesex 507-7 dec v Essex 115-3 (33.5 overs) Off-spinner Ollie Rayner strikes an important blow for Middlesex in only his second over as Essex opener Nick Browne falls lbw after hitting six fours in a 114-ball innings. Jamie Porter comes out as nightwatchman and there are two overs to go.Â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Worcestershire 188 & 153 v Northamptonshire 157 & 154-9 (41 overs) Is that Northamptonshire's last hope gone? Josh Cobb gives a return catch to 19-year-old Josh Tongue, who now has figures of 4-43 from 10 overs. The visitors still need another 31 runs to win, with their last-wicket pair at the crease. Hampshire 455 v Yorkshire 128-6 (43 overs) An uncomfortable day for Yorkshire after Hampshire managed to add 174 to their overnight 281-4, with Gareth Berg hitting an unbeaten 99 after skipper James Vince fell early for 147. Berg then ripped through the visitors' top order, with Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow both going cheaply, as they slumped to 46-5. Skipper Gary Ballance has provided some stability for his side with an unbeaten 63, but they trail by 327 going into day three.Â Kent 259 & 142-7 (35 overs) v Derbyshire 159 Having taken the teams off for bad light, the umpires waste no time in declaring play over for the day at the Spitfire Ground. With Kent 242 to the good, but with only three wickets remaining, it looks like this game is heading for a positive result, one way or the other. Gloucestershire 303 v Durham 270-4 (88 overs) If you want a player with grit, look no further than Durham skipper Paul Collingwood. Struck a painful blow on the hand earlier in the day, he nevertheless came out to bat at number five and survived nearly 27 overs for his 28 not out as his side progressed to just 33 runs behind Gloucestershire's first-innings total. Earlier, England batsman Keaton Jennings showed that he is in good nick by making 87 and sharing an opening stand of 114 with Stephen Cook (64). So comfortable did Jennings look that it was a surprise when he nicked through to the keeper off Chris Liddle. Â Â Kent 259 & 142-7 (35 overs) v Derbyshire 159 As the clock ticks past seven o'clock, the umpires decide the light isn't good enough at Canterbury for play to continue. Kent lead by 242, with Darren Stevens, who took six wickets earlier in the day, on 53 not out. He and Adam Rouse have added 31 in four overs since Matt Coles fell to Luis Reece for seven, so it doesn't look like they were having too much bother seeing the ball. Leicestershire 420 v Glamorgan 281-4 (71 overs) Glamorgan opener Nick Selman is unlikely to forget this day in a hurry after making the third first-class century of his career. The Welsh county have made a good fist of replying to Leicestershire's first innings total and following Selman's 117, Colin Ingram has reached an unbeaten 84 off 153 balls, with two sixes and 12 fours. Leicestershire will be hoping for early wickets on day three in order to press home their advantage following defeats in their opening two games of the summer. Â Worcestershire 188 & 153 v Northamptonshire 157 & 127-8 (36 overs) Last summer Josh Cobb played a brilliant innings to win the T20 Blast final for Northants. They need another from him now with 58 still needed for victory at New Road. Nathan Buck is unable to provide the support he needs as home skipper Joe Leach takes his fourth wickets of the innings. Nottinghamshire beat Sussex by an innings and 88 runs Isabelle Westburyat Trent Bridge A
mismatch of class is probably the only way to describe the events at Trent
Bridge, where a four-pronged Notts seam attack wreaked havoc against an injury-ridden
and inexperienced Sussex side.Â The Australian quick James Pattinson capped off
a fine, if fleeting, overseas stint to claim seven wickets in the game, ably
supported by five each from homegrown favourites Stuart Broad and Luke
Fletcher.Â At
88-5 on the first day Notts looked to be struggling in overcast conditions,
but a dynamic double-century from Riki Wessels flipped the game on its head as
they cantered to a first innings total of 447.Â Sussex in reply could only
manage 155 and, having been bowled out just before lunch today, it was no
surprise when Notts skipper Chris Read sent them back in to follow on.Â Chris
Nash made the only half-century for the visitors before falling lbw to
Pattinson and if Sussex fans have anything to take away from the game, itâs the performance of Jofra Archer, whose three wickets
and 87 runs across two innings showed signs of an exciting future.Â Middlesex 507-7 dec v Essex 94-2 (26 overs) Nick GledhillBBC Essex The
early Middlesex declaration after tea left Essex 36 overs to bat in this
final session. They have lost Alastair Cook and Tom Westley, the heroes from
Taunton, who were both looking good while at the crease.Â Nick Browne is
established and Essex now need him to make his first big score of the season. Middlesex have to bowl Essex out for less than 358 to enforce the follow on.
Should Essex get past that mark there may not be enough time for the champions to
force a result on a pitch that's unlikely to deteriorate. Worcestershire 188 & 153 v Northamptonshire 157 & 122-7 (34.4 overs) Josh Tongue strikes for the second time in the over and Worcestershire now look favourites as Nathan Buck, who took 4-42 in Worcestershire's second innings, comes out to join Josh Cobb. Worcestershire 188 & 153 v Northamptonshire 157 & 122-6 It has certainly been a remarkable match at New Road, where the game is on a knife edge - if you'll forgive the cliche - with Northants needing another 63 for victory. Richard Levi becomes the 36th batsman dismissed in the game as Josh Tongue claims his second victim of the visitors' second innings. Two new batsman at the crease now, Steven Crook and Josh Cobb. Can they emulate Notts and make it three wins out of three? Well, they certainly have the nerve, after beating Derbyshire off the penultimate ball last week.Â Hampshire 455 v Yorkshire 105-6 (34 overs) Yorkshire skipper Gary Ballance picks up two runs off Gareth Berg to reach an 89-ball half-century and without him, they would be in a sorry mess at the Ageas Bowl. Five of the top six failed to reach double figures, including Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow, and the visitors have a big job on their hands to avoid the possibility of following on.Â Warwickshire 332 v Surrey 299-3 (83 overs) Time runs out on Kumar Sangakkara, who ends the second day at Edgbaston just two runs sort of yet another century. The Sri Lankan has hit two sixes and nine fours and his 140-run partnership with Mark Stoneman has put Surrey on course for what should be a handy first-innings lead. They are only 33 behind, with seven wickets standing, after opener Stoneman led the way with 123 - his second Championship century for his new county, and one which might persuade the England selectors to keep him in the 'one to watch' column.Â Middlesex 507-7 dec v Essex 86-2 (22 overs) England's Steven Finn is operating as second change for champions Middlesex, but he's made an important breakthrough by sending Tom Westley on his way. Nick Browne has 33 not out as Dan Lawrence joins him in the middle.Â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
How to do an election in 7 weeks,"When Theresa May announced on Tuesday she was seeking an early general election, scores of people saw their weekends and half-term holidays vanish in a giant puff of electioneering, manifesto-writing and the mammoth admin task of staging a nationwide ballot. By anyone's estimations, the general election of 2015 was an immense piece of administration. Forty-five million ballot papers were printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election. Forty-three thousand polling stations were staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. And the total cost of it came to Â£98,845,157. But all that was organised with five years' notice - the duration between the previous election and the date of the 2015 poll. WATCH: The moment Mrs May announced the surprise election The time frame for the 2017 ballot, which takes place on 8 June, is little more than seven weeks. One Conservative member of staff told the BBC she was completely taken aback. ""I have friends who work for ministers and even they didn't see it coming until the Cabinet meeting took place."" The clock is already ticking, and there is much work to be done. A Labour aide working for an MP described the past week as ""very stressful"". ""In my own time after work I've been contributing to campaign materials and arranging to uproot myself from London so I can go back to the constituency."" While general elections are about putting MPs in Parliament, it falls to councils to organise the nitty-gritty of voting and counting. Venues for polling stations and counting centres will need to be earmarked and reserved for 8 June. And that needs to happen before polling cards can be sent out. Some of the 120,000 people employed to conduct the 2015 election This work is carried out by local authorities' electoral services divisions and overseen by returning officers. John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, predicts this election will be particularly onerous for two reasons - the compressed time scale, and the fact local elections are already taking place in many areas in less than two weeks. ""Many polling stations aren't publicly owned,"" said Mr Turner. ""They're church halls or community centres, and a lot rests on returning officers' ability to persuade the owners to move things around and make the space available."" As for staffing, electoral services departments maintain databases of temporary workers. But ""in this case some of them may already have made other plans or booked holidays"". The big questions about the election, answered Which MPs are going and who might return? ""Although returning officers are helped by permanent teams, this varies a lot. In some district councils it will only be two or three people and colleagues from other departments will have to pitch in. Polling stations have to be organised ""It's going to be an intense time for many of us, working 12-hour days."" Mr Turner is confident, however, that it will all come together in time, noting: ""We're a bit like the duck paddling away beneath the water but serene on the surface."" There's equally little hope of sleep for those in charge of political policy making. They will be working around the clock on putting together manifestos. It's a particularly stressful time for the party in government, says Nick Pearce, head of the No 10 policy unit under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. As well as existing government duties, staff will be working ""flat-out"" to get the document finalised. ""A minister, usually from the Cabinet Office, takes overall responsibility, working with political staff from different departments to draft sections and liaise with the prime minister and her chief of staff,"" he explained. Ministers, lobbyists and Treasury staff also get heavily involved, trying to place pet projects and ensure big-ticket items are properly costed. ""There's huge pressure not to get anything wrong,"" said Mr Pearce. ""But working quickly like this there is certainly potential for that to happen."" And what of getting the message out? Seven weeks is ""a very, very tight time frame"" for organising a marketing and advertising strategy, said Rachel Hamburger, an advertising executive and former Lib Dem campaigner. ""I'd be very surprised if we saw any nationwide broadcast campaigns comparable to famous ones of the past such as the Blair 'devil eyes',"" she said. ""With a long run-up, parties could be expected to run focus groups, market research and analysis of what is most important to their campaign before deploying adverts. This time, she believes. parties will ""concentrate resources on individual seats and simple messages"". Elsewhere in the media, broadcasters are preparing for election night. The BBC is reassigning hundreds of researchers, producers, camera crews and local reporters to put together its results programme. Parties, meanwhile, have to deal with the small matter of ensuring there are candidates in place in 650 constituencies for people to elect. Labour and the Conservatives have bothaltered their normal selection procedures to speed things up, while all 54 of the SNP's existing MPs are expected to stand again. David Dimbleby, left, will host the BBC's election night results programme The other parties are in varying states of readiness. The Lib Dems say they have about 100 candidates still to pick. UKIP and Plaid Cymru will adopt the bulk of their candidates next week, while Greens' selection is under way with local electoral alliances under consideration. None of Northern Ireland's parties are thought to have selected candidates, as talks continue about restoring devolved government. Most candidates will not have had a chance to allocate resources. It has already led some to take the unusual step of appealing for online donations. Regional party offices will provide MPs and activists with support, but the prevailing mood could be described as one of apprehensiveness. When asked to sum up how things were going, a fretful Conservative source said: ""Everything is basically on fire."" A Labour campaigner replied with a series of distressed crying and screaming emojis. How do you call an early election? However, on a purely technical point, it's worth noting the 50-day gap between announcement and polling day is actually the longest since 1983. What's different this time is the lack of preamble, and thus preparation.

How much has Trump achieved so far?,"The first two years of the Trump White House have been eventful, to say the least. But let's ignore the drama and instead focus on the numbers. We're tracking the president's progress on his agenda and how it is received by the American public and the wider world. And there are interesting - and surprising - comparisons with some of his predecessors. Donald Trump began his term as one of the most unpopular presidents in the modern era and he remains so. His approval rating is just 37%, according toGallup,external. Presidents Barack Obama (50%), George W Bush (58%) and Bill Clinton (54%) were all higher at this point. The only president in recent decades to have anything like Mr Trump's low rating at this stage was, perhaps surprisingly, Ronald Reagan, who was also languishing at 37% in 1983. His numbers slowly improved after that and he went on to win a second term as president. One upside for Mr Trump is that he still has the backing of Republican voters - 88% of them approve of his presidency. If that number stays high, it's unlikely he'll face a serious challenge to be the Republican candidate in 2020. President Trump's administration has repeatedly been branded as chaotic and dysfunctional by his critics. There is a long list of senior officials who have either quit, been fired or forced out of the White House - but has the turnover been worse than previous administrations? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Well, yes, it has.Research,externalby the Brookings Institution found that 65% of his senior-ranking advisers had left their job within the two-year mark. That's considerably more than most of his recent predecessors. Usually, a president's top team sticks together for the first year and then changes a little in the second - but for Mr Trump, the departures have been fairly regular since day one. The lack of stability in the White House has shown when it comes to measuring Mr Trump's success with policy. He has had trouble delivering in areas where he's needed to navigate the corridors of Congress, despite controlling both chambers until Democrats regained the House at the start of January. On healthcare, for example, he failed on his promise to kill off President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which helped more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans get health cover but suffered from rising premiums. His main legislative success was passing a major tax reform bill, which saw corporation tax was reduced from 35% to 21%. However, individual cuts for families failed to help Republicans in the mid-term elections. His other big success was getting two new Supreme Court judges confirmed, including Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual assault during his confirmation process. Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Elsewhere, the president has used executive orders to meet symbolic policy goals like moving of the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement. He has also moved to draw down troop levels overseas, including in Afghanistan and Syria. But overall, independent fact-checking website Politifactsays,externalthat President Trump has delivered on relatively few of his campaign promises, while almost half have been blocked or dropped. In full: Has Trump kept his promises? Building a border wall paid for by Mexico was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign but it still appears unlikely to happen. Congress has approved $1.7bn in funding for 124 miles of new and replacement barrier since Mr Trump entered the White House, but estimates for building the president's desired wall range from from $12bn to $70bn. In December, after criticism over the lack of progress on the wall from some conservative commentators, President Trump triggered an unprecedented 35-day partial shutdown of the US government. US shutdown: Four reasons why Trump blinked He had hoped to pressure Democrats into making a deal, but he was eventually forced into reopening the government without an agreement. The US economy lost $11bn during the five-week period but about $8bn would be recouped as employees receive back pay,according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office,external. Throughout the shutdown, Mr Trump argued that the wall was needed to stem a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border"", involving ""thousands of illegal immigrants"". However, figures show that illegal border crossings have seen an overall decline since 2000. The dispute over Trump's wall in seven charts President Trump continues to press Congress to change US immigration laws, including ending the visa lottery system and ""chain migration"" that gives priority to relatives of existing legal US residents. The Supreme Court also handed him a victory in June last year, when it upheld his ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries entering the US on grounds of national security. During the campaign, Mr Trump vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become ""the greatest jobs president... ever"". He used to claim the actual unemployment rate was more than 40%. Now he's America's CEO, he's embracing the same jobless figures he once dismissed as ""phony"". Those figures do show, though, that job creation under Mr Trump during his first two years in office fell slightly when compared to President Obama's final two. However, the basic trajectory of the economy under President Trump remains the same as it was under President Obama - the unemployment rate is historically low and wages are growing at a faster rate in recent months. But there are some concerns for Mr Trump. Global economic growth is down and his decision to start a trade war with China led to retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The president has been quick to take credit for booming stock markets over the past couple of years, but they have started to wobble in recent weeks. The next presidential election may be more than 18 months away, but the campaign has already kicked off. Encouraged by a good set of mid-term election results, the Democrats are optimistic on retaking the White House. Several candidates have already announced that they are standing for the Democratic nomination, with the two biggest hitters being senators - Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Other potentials, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are still mulling a run. But whoever the candidate turns out to be, the early signs are that President Trump is in for another tough battle. Arecent poll,externalfound that seven possible Democrat rivals are all outperforming the president in hypothetical head-to-heads. While that should be taken with a pinch of salt this far out from election day, it will make Republicans feel a little nervous. Which Democrats are running in 2020?

Around the world in seven years... on a bike,"This video can not be played Leigh Timmis ran out of money. But he didn't go home. He kept cycling. Leigh Timmis has been cycling around the world since 2010 - and on Saturday he's coming home. His seven years in the saddle have seen him confront a mountain lion and sing to a bear, all on a globetrotting budget of Â£5 ($6.40) a day. As he reaches the final leg of his journey home to Derby, Leigh, 35, thinks back over the previous 43,000 miles (69,000km) with a broad smile. ""The whole world has been my garden,"" he says wistfully. ""I never thought about what happens on the 23rd (of April). What do you do after this?"" It was seven years ago when, depressed with a life lacking direction, Leigh said he would circle the globe on a bike. With youth on his side and savings in the bank, he thought he could achieve his dream in two years, while raising money for the Derbyshire Children's Holiday Centre. ""I guess a lot of men want to go on this sort of ego trip - show the world how great I am. ""I thought it would just be about me and this freedom."" But the naive visions he had of conquering the world changed soon after he left. Mapping the journey Leigh on day one in Derby and much later, in Tibet ""I didn't know how to do what I'd set out to do. I couldn't speak languages, I didn't know how to sleep wild,"" he said. ""So I began meeting people - sharing evenings with them and meeting their families."" The journey was no longer about racing from one country to the next, but experiencing them one by one. The slow and vulnerable bicycle was the perfect vehicle ""to connect to people"". When he ran out of money, he didn't go home, but found work and kept cycling. A room with a view in Bolivia On the road, Leigh normally slept in a tent, rarely paying for transport or accommodation. Throughout his journey, he lived off an average of Â£5 a day. He says this simple living and the kindness of strangers saw his values change. It's only recently Leigh has had a mobile phone - a deliberate decision to enable him to travel free from technology. Besides, he says, when he left the UK not everyone had smartphones. Leigh said attaching a sign to the bike often led to offers of food or accommodation Petrol stove Water filter and water bladder Coffee maker - one of Leigh's ""luxuries"" A waterproof and other clothes A tool kit and a first aid kit Sleeping bag and inflatable mattress Towel Tent and food bag (attached separately to the back of the bike) Despite his nomadic existence, one thing has remained a constant for Leigh. ""I've got a strong relationship with this bike,"" he says. ""I haven't had a relationship with a girl for this long."" Dolly is the same bike he has had for the entire trip - handmade for him in Derby. She's heavy, but was built to last and still has the same frame and wheels as day one. Leigh recalls a Tom Hanks Castaway moment, when in Peru, he found himself getting particularly emotional and talking to the bike he had been through so much with. ""All my things in the world are on that bike."" And - perhaps remarkably - Dolly was never stolen. ""People see it's my whole life and they have respect for this. There is an element of trust in the world."" Wildlife wasn't always so friendly, and Leigh admits naivety got him through on more than one occasion. In Canada he came skidding face to face with a bear. He recalled that just weeks before a friend's daughter had been reading a book about bears, including a poem to recite should you ever encounter them. ""The only thing that came to my head was this stupid song."" And so he found himself singing the words to which he is now indebted. Another ""lesson in the necessities of life"" came in the Australian outback when, while cycling in the 40C heat, his water supply slipped off the bike and he had to run back to search for it. ""At that moment you realise how precious just one litre of water is. ""That was a big lesson."" Mountain climbs in Ecuador Many miles later, after a couple of weeks working in Australia and Taiwan, travelling through China and the Americas, Leigh started running out of money again which led him to consider the journey home. A meticulous diary keeper, he has written entries about almost every day of his travels. When a diary was finished, he sent it back to his mum, who would get a glimpse into her son's life. 14 December 2012, in the Australian outback desert The nosebleeds dry and the smell of rotten camel fades and I continue to sip saline and push Dolly for the last few days of the desert as Kata Tjuta begins to loom on the horizon like a crowd of balding heads. Despite limited contact with his family, he says his relationships with his parents and sister are now closer than ever and the thought of them (and a reliable water source) have pulled him back to the UK. Adapting to a ""normal"" life will be difficult, he admits, but: ""I realise how lucky I am. A lot of people won't get this opportunity."" A long and dusty road in Australia So what is he most looking forward to about being back on British soil? ""The smell of going past a fish and chip shop and to be able to listen to people in the supermarket and understanding every word,"" he says. ""But the real emotion will be when I see my mum in the place I left her seven years ago. I get a lump in my throat just thinking about it."" He's now considering a job working with children - wanting to share his experience and ""show people what is possible"". ""But there'll definitely be some more adventure.

Was ITV's The Nightly Show a success?,"Dermot O'Leary and Davina McCall were among the hosts ITV's The Nightly Show didn't get off to the strongest start - but its fortunes improved over its eight-week run. The first series of the new entertainment show drew to a close on Friday after 40 episodes. It was broadcast every weeknight in the 10pm slot normally occupied by the news, and saw a different celebrity take over presenting duties each week. The show struggled at the beginning- viewing figures quickly dropped after the first episode hosted by David Walliams andcritics weren't too keen on it either,external. But things improved as the series progressed, with the show gradually building an online audience and some presenters proving particularly popular with viewers. An ITV spokesman said: ""ITV is doing better than any other terrestrial channel this year in terms of year-on-year performance, we've had a really strong start to the year. ""We're in a strong position to try some new things and experiment, it is imperative we try new things, which have the potential to enhance our entertainment offering."" Let's take look back over The Nightly Show's first season. David Walliams was the first of The Nightly Show's guest presenters David Walliams was on hosting duties for The Nightly Show's first week - and helped the series start strongly with an average of 2.9 million live viewers tuning in for its opening episode. But his performance receivednegative reviews,externalfrom critics and the audience dropped to 1.2 million by Friday's programme. ""I think David Walliams just isn't a natural presenter, and it really came across,"" says Frances Taylor, TV critic forthe Radio Times,external. ""He's a great actor and comedian but we'd never seen him at the helm of a programme, and if you're going to have revolving hosts you've got to have someone strong to kick it off. ""If you don't, viewers will lose interest, and once they've gone, it's difficult to get them back."" Dermot O'Leary was one of the most popular presenters with viewers Walliams put the viewing figures and poor reviews down topeople being annoyedabout the News at Ten being moved back by half an hour in the schedules. After his stint, John Bishop, Davina McCall, Dermot O'Leary, Gordon Ramsay, Bradley Walsh and Jason Manford all had a turn. Some presenters were more popular with viewers and critics - particularly O'Leary, who was booked for a second week later in the run. Ramsay proved a successful booking too, and he helped the show build a stronger online following, partly due to the star guests he drew to the show. Several of Gordon Ramsay's segments went viral, such as musician John Legend's comic take on Ramsay's sweary language UK chat show hosts such as Graham Norton, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross regularly attract high-profile guests, but their shows only air once a week. When you've got five nights of shows to fill, talent booking is a greater challenge, especially outside the US, says author, lecturer and television executive Lyndsay Duthie. ""In the US, you've got A-list guests night after night because there's a bigger talent pool to draw from,"" she says. ""James Corden has Madonna and Michelle Obama taking part inCarpool Karaoke, which makes it not only entertaining, you can't believe the talent they've got on there."" The Nightly Show struggled a little on this front - but it did manage to attract some big names as it went on, particularly the week Ramsay was in charge. ""The stuff Gordon Ramsay did with John Legend has got such global appeal because they're such big stars in America,"" says Frances Taylor. In one segment, which was a hit, Legend was seen at a piano, singing some of the foul-mouthed chef's most famous TV insults. ""If you've got names like that then people all round the world will recognise them, and that means that it probably will go viral, and that's the whole point of shows like this,"" Taylor adds. ""Bradley Walsh interviewing Louise Redknapp didn't have quite the same worldwide appeal."" The Oscars mix-up occurred the evening before The Nightly Show launched One of the benefits of producing a show which is recorded on the same day it's broadcast is the writers' ability to put in jokes about the day's news events. Taylor says: ""A show like this lives and dies by the writing, and The Nightly Show was billed as a topical programme, but there was hardly any topicality in it."" ""TheOscars gaffe, which happened the day before their first show, was such a gift as a topic, but David Walliams could only come up with a couple of poor envelope swapping gags."" She compares it to the pastiche The Late Late Show did in the US, where Corden dressed up as Emma Stone and sang a parody song about the Oscars mix-up, which Taylor says was a stronger treatment. ""If The Nightly Show comes back it needs to play on the topicality. The fact this is filmed a couple of hours before transmission, they're not maximising that opportunity."" But Duthie says: ""In the US you have teams and teams of people writing the opening monologues, which is a luxury that most British shows don't have."" Jason Manford hosted the show in its penultimate week ITV pushed the News at Ten back by half an hour to make room for The Nightly Show as part of the broadcaster's initiative to try out what it calls ""Five Nights of New"" schedule. But, says Duthie, where The Nightly Show was concerned, it may have suffered due to its chosen timeslot. The most successful chat shows in the US start much later in the evening. ""In the UK we're much more conservative,"" she says. ""By 10:30pm, peak time is over. But if a show is on later, you're catching people coming home from the pub late at night, and a lot of younger viewers."" She adds that part of the problem facing any new nightly entertainment show is the difference in audience expectation between the UK and the US. ""We've gotten so used to watching light-hearted entertainment shows on Friday and Saturdays that a lot of British viewers aren't used to upbeat, happy content on a Monday evening,"" Duthie says. ""Also, perhaps the networks wouldn't pay for original programming at 11:30pm in the UK - budgets are usually spent by about 10:30."" But she praised ITV for being willing to try something new in the first place: ""As much as I love the News at Ten, it wasn't performing very well for ITV, so commercially it was a good decision to look at that 10 o'clock slot."" ITV pushed its evening news bulletin, fronted by Tom Bradby, back in the schedule ITV's director of TV Kevin Lygo toldBroadcast:,external""In terms of The Nightly Show, this eight-week run is about extending the 10pm hour, extending the primetime feel of ITV, and seeing how that looks and feels during this period and how viewers respond to something other than repeats, alongside the News. ""The intention was to make that hour feel a bit fresh and different with some stunt scheduling and I think we've done that. ""After the run has finished we'll obviously look at the shows and all the data and discuss what next. ""The broader point is - TV is a risk business, you need to try new things, and launch them with confidence and visibility to give them the best chance of success. ""And you've got keep doing that, and we will."" John Bishop and Bradley Walsh presented The Nightly Show during its run US chat show hosts - from Ellen DeGeneres to Jimmy Fallon - now depend heavily on building a strong online following to match their viewing figures. The Nightly Show had mixed fortunes on this front, with some segments not attracting many views, but others going viral worldwide. At the time of writing, a compilation of Ramsay's best pranks during his week on the show has attracted 3.4 million views. Fay Ripley giving parenting tips to John Bishop, in contrast, has had just a couple of hundred. But while social media success can give a show a huge boost, it can also cause the problem of shows being judged too quickly. Fleabag's strong online following helped it build an audience ""Now you get such a snap decision with everything,"" says Taylor. ""If something isn't immediately funny, you see people all over Twitter saying 'this is rubbish'. ""Social media can be great because you can build an audience for a show and make it an underground hit, like Fleabag. ""But conversely, when you've got something high profile that people don't enjoy, the knives are out. ""To some extent, all publicity is good publicity, but if a show can't breathe, it will put people off. Once that dies down, more people are likely to come to it naturally."" The ITV spokesman said the show's online clip performance had been ""impressive, amassing more than 40 million views in total for its online content across various platforms, and more than 50,000 subscribers and followers"". Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Fallon's US shows have a strong online presence ""The figures reflected the viral nature of the content. The John Legend/Gordon Ramsay sketch accrued more than 16.5 million views on Facebook. It was shared more than 310,000 times.

UK music industry braced for Brexit,"Whether you consume music digitally or collect vinyl records, Brexit has the potential to affect you. The UK music industry, like its counterparts in other countries, has had a tough time adapting to the technological shake-ups of recent years. But now it also has to plan for the changes that will be ushered in by the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Obviously there is still huge uncertainty about what the country's future relationship with the EU will be like, since its expected departure in the spring of 2019 is still subject to lengthy negotiations. However, it is already possible to identify areas of the music business that may feel the effects. With the industry's annual Record Store Day falling this year on Saturday, 22 April, record shops are enjoying a boom in sales of old-fashioned vinyl releases. The format was widely expected to die a slow death with the advent of the CD, but in recent times, vinyl records have managed tooutsell downloads. However, when Record Store Day 2020 rolls around, there is a risk that those singles and albums could cost significantly more. Will these records cost more post-Brexit? If the UK does not manage to conclude a favourable trade deal with the EU, then tariffs may be applied on goods coming into the UK. There are now only a couple of vinyl pressing plants left on British soil, so the majority of records sold in the UK are manufactured in factories based in other EU countries. The same goes for CDs. If tariffs on goods return, record labels will face increased costs, which they will have to pass on to consumers. So why buy music on physical formats anyway? This is the 21st Century, so go for streaming or downloads. Well, even there, Brexit is likely to have consequences. The pound has fallen in value in the wake of last June's referendum outcome. The leading music streaming services, from Sweden's Spotify to US-based Apple Music, are all multinational firms whose pricing policies are decided elsewhere. Apple has alreadyincreased the price of its apps this year, in a move widely attributed to the Brexit vote. Apple Music subscriptions could follow suit if the pound falls any further. In other ways, however, Brexit will have no effect at all. Many politicians and business leaders have called for the UK to preserve its access to the European single market, but in digital terms, things are more complicated. The vast majority of Spotify's catalogue is available all over the world While goods are covered by the single market in Europe,the market for services is still very much a work in progress. And when it comes to the distribution of digital products, including music and e-books, consumers will still find that borders get in the way. If you have an account with Amazon UK, you can buy a CD from Amazon's French website, but it won't allow you to buy the same music on download. That said, streaming services are more unified. Spotify, for instance, makes practically all its catalogue accessible everywhere in the world, with some minor variations in local-language music. But although Brussels has failed to create a digital single market for music consumers, it has done a lot for music producers. People who make music can make money from it in various ways. As well as selling digital or physical copies of it, they are also paid royalties every time it is played in public. There are two kinds of these: mechanical royalties, which you get whenever your music is reproduced on CD or vinyl, or as a download or stream performance royalties, which you get when your song is performed live or played on radio or television Mechanical royalties date back to the days of piano rolls And although there is no EU single market for digital music purchases, there is now a thriving single market for licensing music and collecting royalties on it. In the UK, the main royalty collection society is PRS for Music. Its chief executive, Robert Ashcroft, says that the European Commission made a big difference with itsCollective Rights Management Directive,external, which came into force in the UK in April last year. As a result, it is now much easier to license music in many territories at once, rather than having to authorise it country by country, as was formerly the case. PRS, for example, works in a joint venture with its counterparts in Sweden and Germany, STIM and GEMA, to operate a pan-European online music rights licensing service. This means that songwriters and music publishing companies can get paid more quickly and accurately. ""We have already been licensing our rights on a pan-European basis,"" says Mr Ashcroft. ""Brexit won't stop that and it's not in our business interest to stop it either."" The UK's law on music copyright has changed in recent years because of Brussels. In November 2013, UK copyright protection on sound recordings increased from 50 years to 70 years, in line with an EU directive approved in 2011. However, recordings that had already slipped into the public domain, such as the Beatles' first single, stayed there. The Beatles' earliest recordings are now out of copyright And there is a ""use it or lose it"" provision for hitherto unreleased recordings from 50 years ago. If record companies have ageing tracks in the vaults that they have never issued, then they have no comeback if other people get hold of them and release them. Will all this change when the UK ""takes back control""? PRS's Mr Ashcroft thinks not. ""I expect it to continue unless and until someone presents an argument that it's damaging to the economy,"" he says. One area where Brexit could have a negative impact is on touring musicians. There are fears that music groups might have toscale back European toursafter Brexit and fewer European acts could travel to the UK. ""We have a very healthy business in royalties that are earned when our members' works are performed overseas,"" says PRS's Mr Ashcroft. ""If there were obstacles to British bands touring, that would be a potential challenge."" At the same time, however, he is concerned about Brexit's potential impact on his own organisation's staffing levels. ""Eleven per cent of our employees come from countries other than the UK. We operate daily in 13 languages. We need the prime minister to give assurances that the people resident and working here can stay."" On that basis, he feels that the UK's music business is well integrated with the rest of Europe and hopes it will stay that way, despite Brexit: ""We are so international that we think our business transcends that.""

'Desperate to protect my daughters from FGM',"FGM is illegal in the UK but campaigners warn children are still taken abroad to have it done A case of female genital mutilation was discovered every three days, on average, by maternity staff in Wales last year, according to new figures. One victim - an asylum seeker mother-of-three living in Swansea - describes her struggle to protect her two daughters from the practice. Names have been withheld to protect her children. I was cut when I was two days old. I didn't know anything about it until years later my mum told me I had it done. For me, growing up in Benin City in Nigeria, it was normal. Everyone had it done. The eldest of five daughters I was aware of my younger sisters having it done when I was growing up. But I would just go off to play when the cutter came, I didn't really realise what was going on. It wasn't until the cutter came to see my youngest sister I realised what was happening. By then she was seven and I was 12, so I was a bit more aware. My mother told my sister in the weeks before: ""Someone is coming to cut you, like I cut your sisters, my mum cut me and my great-grandmother cut her. It is nothing."" Then I asked her about it. She said it was a man who cut me, I bled for an hour and nearly died. After that they didn't cut my sisters until they were a bit older as they were scared they would die. Even though I knew this, I couldn't tell my sister because if she didn't have it done or tried to run away people would have told her she was unclean, the community would have despised her and she would have been told she didn't belong. This video can not be played FGM survivor describes witnessing her sister being cut That day, the cutter had already been to see other girls. The cutter lay a small mat down in the back yard of our house and had pieces of broken bottles, razor blades to do the cutting. They were not clean, they had blood on them already. She had a big lady with her, she forced my sister onto the ground and sat on her chest to hold her still. My sister could hardly breathe and couldn't move her arms or legs. The cutter was behind the lady and got to work. My sister was fighting, she was screaming, but there was nothing she could do. I was screaming ""stop this"". Even my mum couldn't watch. By the end there was blood everywhere and my sister was unconscious. She had cried so much she didn't have anything left to give. They said to give her water and tried to clean her up. That was all she had to make her feel better - water. I just thought it was something that had to happen or you wouldn't be accepted by the community. I didn't know any different. My mum told you: ""If you don't do it your husband in future will not like you, will not respect you, will not appreciate that you are a proper woman. You will be cast out by the community"". They want the man to enjoy sex with you, it is all for the man, but why go through pain for just the man to enjoy sex with you when you don't enjoy it? It does not make sense to me. When I came to England in 2007 I started to realise it was not necessarily the natural thing I had been brought up to believe. When I had my first boyfriend it was painful both during sex and after sex, I couldn't understand it. But I had no-one to talk to about it. I just assumed it was normal. When I fell pregnant they told me I couldn't give birth naturally, so I had to have a Caesarean with both my girls and my little boy. FGM destroys your body. My daughter will soon turn seven - the age when my sister had it done - and I am so scared that someone will try to do it to her. For links to organisations offering support on FGMvisit BBC Action Line World Health Organisationfactsheet on FGM,external Crimestoppers areencouraging people to report FGM,external I'm so happy my girls weren't born in Nigeria - if they had been my mum would have quietly come to my house, even if I said no, when I was at the market she would have come and had them cut. I'm no longer in touch with family back in Nigeria, and thank god for that at the moment because of the risk of FGM. I'm just trying to bring my girls up, to teach them about my country and gradually teach them about FGM. But how do you explain FGM to a seven-year-old child? I'm afraid to take them back to Nigeria to visit, I would really love to, but how safe is it? Even though it is banned there now it is still a way of life, because their foremothers have been doing it for a long time they continue to do it. If I saw my mum, my sister or my grandmother there would be a very-massive risk for my girls. Campaigners believe young girls are targeted for FGM in the summer holidays - when there is time for them to recover No way will I let someone do that to my girls, no way. They are happy, they are free, they are so blessed. But even though we are in Wales now I'm so worried about someone seeing them and thinking they must have it done, and taking an opportunity to do it. I know people might think ""why would they cut my daughters if they don't know them?"" but they are from a community that practises it. They might think this is a young girl, she needs to have it done. I can never leave them anywhere, I can never leave them with anyone. Survivors like me need to talk about being cut so that people know about it, so we are empowered to protect our children from it. If everyone keeps quiet, how are we going to stop it? I want my daughters to know I stood up to speak against it, that is what I think my mum should have done for me and I want to do it for them. Just as generations have been doing it, maybe my generation will be the one that stops it. 123 victims of FGM treated in Wales My quarrel with a proud FGM cutter FGM clinic for Wales campaign FGM medical help needed 'every hour' LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

'Everything's on fire' - the scramble to prepare,"When Theresa May announced on Tuesday she was seeking an early general election, scores of people saw their weekends and half-term holidays vanish in a giant puff of electioneering, manifesto-writing and the mammoth admin task of staging a nationwide ballot. By anyone's estimations, the general election of 2015 was an immense piece of administration. Forty-five million ballot papers were printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election. Forty-three thousand polling stations were staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. And the total cost of it came to Â£98,845,157. But all that was organised with five years' notice - the duration between the previous election and the date of the 2015 poll. WATCH: The moment Mrs May announced the surprise election The time frame for the 2017 ballot, which takes place on 8 June, is little more than seven weeks. One Conservative member of staff told the BBC she was completely taken aback. ""I have friends who work for ministers and even they didn't see it coming until the Cabinet meeting took place."" The clock is already ticking, and there is much work to be done. A Labour aide working for an MP described the past week as ""very stressful"". ""In my own time after work I've been contributing to campaign materials and arranging to uproot myself from London so I can go back to the constituency."" While general elections are about putting MPs in Parliament, it falls to councils to organise the nitty-gritty of voting and counting. Venues for polling stations and counting centres will need to be earmarked and reserved for 8 June. And that needs to happen before polling cards can be sent out. Some of the 120,000 people employed to conduct the 2015 election This work is carried out by local authorities' electoral services divisions and overseen by returning officers. John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, predicts this election will be particularly onerous for two reasons - the compressed time scale, and the fact local elections are already taking place in many areas in less than two weeks. ""Many polling stations aren't publicly owned,"" said Mr Turner. ""They're church halls or community centres, and a lot rests on returning officers' ability to persuade the owners to move things around and make the space available."" As for staffing, electoral services departments maintain databases of temporary workers. But ""in this case some of them may already have made other plans or booked holidays"". The big questions about the election, answered Which MPs are going and who might return? ""Although returning officers are helped by permanent teams, this varies a lot. In some district councils it will only be two or three people and colleagues from other departments will have to pitch in. Polling stations have to be organised ""It's going to be an intense time for many of us, working 12-hour days."" Mr Turner is confident, however, that it will all come together in time, noting: ""We're a bit like the duck paddling away beneath the water but serene on the surface."" There's equally little hope of sleep for those in charge of political policy making. They will be working around the clock on putting together manifestos. It's a particularly stressful time for the party in government, says Nick Pearce, head of the No 10 policy unit under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. As well as existing government duties, staff will be working ""flat-out"" to get the document finalised. ""A minister, usually from the Cabinet Office, takes overall responsibility, working with political staff from different departments to draft sections and liaise with the prime minister and her chief of staff,"" he explained. Ministers, lobbyists and Treasury staff also get heavily involved, trying to place pet projects and ensure big-ticket items are properly costed. ""There's huge pressure not to get anything wrong,"" said Mr Pearce. ""But working quickly like this there is certainly potential for that to happen."" And what of getting the message out? Seven weeks is ""a very, very tight time frame"" for organising a marketing and advertising strategy, said Rachel Hamburger, an advertising executive and former Lib Dem campaigner. ""I'd be very surprised if we saw any nationwide broadcast campaigns comparable to famous ones of the past such as the Blair 'devil eyes',"" she said. ""With a long run-up, parties could be expected to run focus groups, market research and analysis of what is most important to their campaign before deploying adverts. This time, she believes. parties will ""concentrate resources on individual seats and simple messages"". Elsewhere in the media, broadcasters are preparing for election night. The BBC is reassigning hundreds of researchers, producers, camera crews and local reporters to put together its results programme. Parties, meanwhile, have to deal with the small matter of ensuring there are candidates in place in 650 constituencies for people to elect. Labour and the Conservatives have bothaltered their normal selection procedures to speed things up, while all 54 of the SNP's existing MPs are expected to stand again. David Dimbleby, left, will host the BBC's election night results programme The other parties are in varying states of readiness. The Lib Dems say they have about 100 candidates still to pick. UKIP and Plaid Cymru will adopt the bulk of their candidates next week, while Greens' selection is under way with local electoral alliances under consideration. None of Northern Ireland's parties are thought to have selected candidates, as talks continue about restoring devolved government. Most candidates will not have had a chance to allocate resources. It has already led some to take the unusual step of appealing for online donations. Regional party offices will provide MPs and activists with support, but the prevailing mood could be described as one of apprehensiveness. When asked to sum up how things were going, a fretful Conservative source said: ""Everything is basically on fire."" A Labour campaigner replied with a series of distressed crying and screaming emojis. How do you call an early election? However, on a purely technical point, it's worth noting the 50-day gap between announcement and polling day is actually the longest since 1983. What's different this time is the lack of preamble, and thus preparation. As the BBC's former head of political research David Cowling put it: ""Everyone was lulled into a false sense of security by assurances... and we're now completely stunned.""

Premier League - reaction from a dramatic afternoon,"FT: Hull 2-0 Watford - Markovic & Clucas FT: Bournemouth 4-0 Boro - King, Afobe, Pugh & Daniels FT: Swansea 2-0 Stoke - Llorente & Carroll FT: West Ham 0-0 Everton Bottom 3: Sunderland (21pts), Boro, (24 pts), Swansea (31pts) Caroline Chapman and Alex Bysouth That's all from this page but we'll be back tomorrow for more Premier League goodness. FYI - you'll find the FA Cup coverageover here.Â Adios.  Here's how it's looking after Saturday's matches. Sunderland have a couple of games in hand but look down and out. Middlesbrough's fate looks similar after their 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth. That dreaded third and final relegation place could go to Swansea or Hull. And what about Palace and Burnley? They're being pulled right into the dog fight.Â West Ham 0-0 Everton West Ham United Hammers boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport:""I am really pleased with the performance, I could not ask anymore from my players. In terms of effort, dedication and determination they get top marks. If any team deserved three points it was us. ""To limit them to one chance requires a lot of hard work. The only bit of negativity is that I felt at moments we lacked some quality in our decision making. We played like 11 lions, one for each other.
""We talk about the magic number of 40, I think we might need a few more points, so we are not going into the last game."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Hull City Hull manager Marco Silva speaking to Premier League Productions:Â""Yes I'm really happy. It was not easy. We played with ten players, but our boys were fantastic and they deserved it. ""Talking about Oumar Niasse's red card - ""I don't want to talk about this situation and I respect the referee and officials, but this is not the first time that something like this has happened. Today we have achieved what we needed, but it was very hard. ""I'm really happy but we still have four games to fight. Maybe in January no one would believe in our club to survive. I don't know what the future is."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Watford Watford Captain Troy Deeney:Â""Not good enough. We just thought we could play some tiki-taka football against a team fighting for their lives.Â ""I'm not in the business of apologising, but it's a long journey for our fans and that wasn't good enough, which is why I went over to apologise to the fans. We have a moral obligation to play better. ""We don't play till Monday and it will be a long hard week. It's just not about this season, it's about next season."" Joshua King has scored five goals more than Middlesbrough (6) in the Premier League
in 2017.Â Ouch.Â Hull City 2-0 Watford Hull City Hull City manager Marco Silva speaking to Match of the Day:Â""We kept our focus and possession and we believed we could score. It was a really important win. I'm really happy when our club fight the way we have and we will continue to fight to keep our club in the Premier League.Â ""The red card was not easy for us. I respect the referee and it is not an easy job, but I watch a lot of games, and I don't see this happening in other games. It is not easy for a team like us to be missing a player.""  #bbcfootball Noel Fitzpatrick:Suddenly Burnley's position is looking precarious!Â Sownak Bose:Marco Silva continues to make his early doubters look like complete mugs. Surely he's one of the managers of the season so far?Â Swansea 2-0 Stoke Stoke City Stoke manager Mark Hughes speaking to Match of the Day:""We made it difficult for ourselves. If you are away you have got to make sure you are in the game and don't concede early and that is what we did.Â ""We hadn't got going. At 1-0 for the most part we were OK but clearly the game has changed on missing the penalty - if we could get back on terms who knows? ""We need to be better at managing the game and affecting the opposition."" Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough Middlesbrough boss Steve Agnew told BBC Match of the Day:""We lost the game in the first period. We defended really poorly
for two goals and gave ourselves a difficult afternoon.Â ""Weâre all disappointed with the defending and the way we conceded early goals. ""We have to go and beat Sunderland on Wednesday and move on from there. Itâs been a tough few months, certainly since our last win.Â ""We have to regroup and be ready for the Sunderland game."" Â On Gaston Ramirez's red card:""Weâre 2-0 down away from home and it becomes very difficult.Â ""We have to stay in the game but that made it tough. Once you have a yellow, you
have to be careful.""Â Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Bournemouth Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe said:""It was a great performance from us, an electric start. We were
dominant in the early stages.Â ""When you consider the importance of the game, the early goal gave us a
huge lift and dented their confidence. Luckily we didnât rest on that and got
the second goal.Â ""Iâm pleased to see the two strikers contributing goals. Itâs a
good base to build your team around. It was trademark Marc Pugh today, intricate wide play. He has a lot of quality, highlighted by his goal. ""We need more points until it [safety] is mathematically secured."" On whether he was behind the free-kick routine which led to Charlie Daniels' goal: ""I wonât take any credit for that. It was off the cuff."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Leon OsmanEx-Everton midfielder on Final Score Look at Hull's home form and their character and attitude, scrapping all game and scraping a win. An outstanding performance. Swansea 2-0 Stoke Swansea City More from Swansea manager Paul Clement:""Things are so tight and sometimes it goes for you. Having looked back at
the penalty I can't see if it is a penalty or is not. We got a bit of luck. Even the goal, it was a fantastic strike from Tom and the deflection took it right into the top corner. ""[Fernando] Llorente did well. He is not in tip top condition physically but is a big focal
point. If we get good service into him, he is a fantastic finisher.Â ""I knew at half-time it was 0-0 at Hull and they were down to 10 men. It is a terrific result for them. I
did feel it would be a game they would win. We have to concentrate on our jobs. We have
massive game next week at Old Trafford. ""I thought we needed three wins and a draw. Hull are in the driving seat
but we will chase them down until the last moment."" Swansea 2-0 Stoke Swansea City Swansea manager Paul Clement speaking to Match of the Day:""I am very proud of the team today. I am happy for our supporters as well. We have struggled in the last few games at a crucial stage of the season. ""I thought it was a must win game and Hull have won and it was absolutely right. ""If the gap had gone to five points with four to play the task would have been very difficult.Â ""Nothing changed between us and Hull but what has changed is we have got momentum now. We played terrific. We rode our luck but overall deserved to win and can look forward."" West Ham 0-0 Everton Everton Everton manager Ronald Koeman told Match of the Day:""It was really far from what we are used to, from the first minute to the last second.Â ""We didn't get the intensity. It was a poor performance with a lot of negatives.Â ""One positive is we kept a clean sheet. We like to perform to a certain level and it was far from that. ""I wasn't happy at half-time so we tried to do something. I couldn't change four, five, six or seven. But I changed two to give a signal to the team. ""We need wins now to get a chance of sixth or fifth place."" 606 phone-inBBC Radio 5 live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Swansea, really, should have scored more but have won 2-0.Â Why didn't Swansea start playing like this four or five games ago? They wouldn't now be in trouble. They have tough games to come but they have helped themselves with this win.Â Thing is though, look at the Hull result. They've matched Swansea...Â Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough midfielder StewartÂ Downing: ""Credit to Bournemouth.Â ""We knew all week that they started quickly in games but we didnât get
going. We can only blame ourselves and nobody else. ""It is hard enough with 11 men, let alone 10. We were chasing from
then on. ""Sorry to the fans, theyâve travelled a long way. Theyâve
been first class all season.Â ""I donât think it was unbelievable play from Bournemouth, it was
sloppy play from us. Itâs hard to take."" This is pretty big news. Man United pair Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo have both sustained cruciate injuries and will both miss the rest of the season. Ibrahimovic landed awkwardly when challenging for the ball during the Europa League quarter-final second-leg win over Anderlecht.

No sleep until polling day - the scramble to prepare,"When Theresa May announced on Tuesday she was seeking an early general election, scores of people saw their weekends and half-term holidays vanish in a giant puff of electioneering, manifesto-writing and the mammoth admin task of staging a nationwide ballot. By anyone's estimations, the general election of 2015 was an immense piece of administration. Forty-five million ballot papers were printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election. Forty-three thousand polling stations were staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. And the total cost of it came to Â£98,845,157. But all that was organised with five years' notice - the duration between the previous election and the date of the 2015 poll. WATCH: The moment Mrs May announced the surprise election The time frame for the 2017 ballot, which takes place on 8 June, is little more than seven weeks. One Conservative member of staff told the BBC she was completely taken aback. ""I have friends who work for ministers and even they didn't see it coming until the Cabinet meeting took place."" The clock is already ticking, and there is much work to be done. A Labour aide working for an MP described the past week as ""very stressful"". ""In my own time after work I've been contributing to campaign materials and arranging to uproot myself from London so I can go back to the constituency."" While general elections are about putting MPs in Parliament, it falls to councils to organise the nitty-gritty of voting and counting. Venues for polling stations and counting centres will need to be earmarked and reserved for 8 June. And that needs to happen before polling cards can be sent out. Some of the 120,000 people employed to conduct the 2015 election This work is carried out by local authorities' electoral services divisions and overseen by returning officers. John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, predicts this election will be particularly onerous for two reasons - the compressed time scale, and the fact local elections are already taking place in many areas in less than two weeks. ""Many polling stations aren't publicly owned,"" said Mr Turner. ""They're church halls or community centres, and a lot rests on returning officers' ability to persuade the owners to move things around and make the space available."" As for staffing, electoral services departments maintain databases of temporary workers. But ""in this case some of them may already have made other plans or booked holidays"". The big questions about the election, answered Which MPs are going and who might return? ""Although returning officers are helped by permanent teams, this varies a lot. In some district councils it will only be two or three people and colleagues from other departments will have to pitch in. Polling stations have to be organised ""It's going to be an intense time for many of us, working 12-hour days."" Mr Turner is confident, however, that it will all come together in time, noting: ""We're a bit like the duck paddling away beneath the water but serene on the surface."" There's equally little hope of sleep for those in charge of political policy making. They will be working around the clock on putting together manifestos. It's a particularly stressful time for the party in government, says Nick Pearce, head of the No 10 policy unit under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. As well as existing government duties, staff will be working ""flat-out"" to get the document finalised. ""A minister, usually from the Cabinet Office, takes overall responsibility, working with political staff from different departments to draft sections and liaise with the prime minister and her chief of staff,"" he explained. Ministers, lobbyists and Treasury staff also get heavily involved, trying to place pet projects and ensure big-ticket items are properly costed. ""There's huge pressure not to get anything wrong,"" said Mr Pearce. ""But working quickly like this there is certainly potential for that to happen."" And what of getting the message out? Seven weeks is ""a very, very tight time frame"" for organising a marketing and advertising strategy, said Rachel Hamburger, an advertising executive and former Lib Dem campaigner. ""I'd be very surprised if we saw any nationwide broadcast campaigns comparable to famous ones of the past such as the Blair 'devil eyes',"" she said. ""With a long run-up, parties could be expected to run focus groups, market research and analysis of what is most important to their campaign before deploying adverts. This time, she believes. parties will ""concentrate resources on individual seats and simple messages"". Elsewhere in the media, broadcasters are preparing for election night. The BBC is reassigning hundreds of researchers, producers, camera crews and local reporters to put together its results programme. Parties, meanwhile, have to deal with the small matter of ensuring there are candidates in place in 650 constituencies for people to elect. Labour and the Conservatives have bothaltered their normal selection procedures to speed things up, while all 54 of the SNP's existing MPs are expected to stand again. David Dimbleby, left, will host the BBC's election night results programme The other parties are in varying states of readiness. The Lib Dems say they have about 100 candidates still to pick. UKIP and Plaid Cymru will adopt the bulk of their candidates next week, while Greens' selection is under way with local electoral alliances under consideration. None of Northern Ireland's parties are thought to have selected candidates, as talks continue about restoring devolved government. Most candidates will not have had a chance to allocate resources. It has already led some to take the unusual step of appealing for online donations. Regional party offices will provide MPs and activists with support, but the prevailing mood could be described as one of apprehensiveness. When asked to sum up how things were going, a fretful Conservative source said: ""Everything is basically on fire."" A Labour campaigner replied with a series of distressed crying and screaming emojis. How do you call an early election? However, on a purely technical point, it's worth noting the 50-day gap between announcement and polling day is actually the longest since 1983.

Premier League reaction - plus watch Final Score,"FT: Hull 2-0 Watford - Markovic & Clucas FT: Bournemouth 4-0 Boro - King, Afobe, Pugh & Daniels FT: Swansea 2-0 Stoke - Llorente & Carroll FT: West Ham 0-0 Everton Bottom 3: Sunderland (21pts), Boro, (24 pts), Swansea (31pts) Caroline Chapman and Alex Bysouth That's all from this page but we'll be back tomorrow for more Premier League goodness. FYI - you'll find the FA Cup coverageover here.Â Adios.  Here's how it's looking after Saturday's matches. Sunderland have a couple of games in hand but look down and out. Middlesbrough's fate looks similar after their 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth. That dreaded third and final relegation place could go to Swansea or Hull. And what about Palace and Burnley? They're being pulled right into the dog fight.Â West Ham 0-0 Everton West Ham United Hammers boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport:""I am really pleased with the performance, I could not ask anymore from my players. In terms of effort, dedication and determination they get top marks. If any team deserved three points it was us. ""To limit them to one chance requires a lot of hard work. The only bit of negativity is that I felt at moments we lacked some quality in our decision making. We played like 11 lions, one for each other.
""We talk about the magic number of 40, I think we might need a few more points, so we are not going into the last game."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Hull City Hull manager Marco Silva speaking to Premier League Productions:Â""Yes I'm really happy. It was not easy. We played with ten players, but our boys were fantastic and they deserved it. ""Talking about Oumar Niasse's red card - ""I don't want to talk about this situation and I respect the referee and officials, but this is not the first time that something like this has happened. Today we have achieved what we needed, but it was very hard. ""I'm really happy but we still have four games to fight. Maybe in January no one would believe in our club to survive. I don't know what the future is."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Watford Watford Captain Troy Deeney:Â""Not good enough. We just thought we could play some tiki-taka football against a team fighting for their lives.Â ""I'm not in the business of apologising, but it's a long journey for our fans and that wasn't good enough, which is why I went over to apologise to the fans. We have a moral obligation to play better. ""We don't play till Monday and it will be a long hard week. It's just not about this season, it's about next season."" Joshua King has scored five goals more than Middlesbrough (6) in the Premier League
in 2017.Â Ouch.Â Hull City 2-0 Watford Hull City Hull City manager Marco Silva speaking to Match of the Day:Â""We kept our focus and possession and we believed we could score. It was a really important win. I'm really happy when our club fight the way we have and we will continue to fight to keep our club in the Premier League.Â ""The red card was not easy for us. I respect the referee and it is not an easy job, but I watch a lot of games, and I don't see this happening in other games. It is not easy for a team like us to be missing a player.""  #bbcfootball Noel Fitzpatrick:Suddenly Burnley's position is looking precarious!Â Sownak Bose:Marco Silva continues to make his early doubters look like complete mugs. Surely he's one of the managers of the season so far?Â Swansea 2-0 Stoke Stoke City Stoke manager Mark Hughes speaking to Match of the Day:""We made it difficult for ourselves. If you are away you have got to make sure you are in the game and don't concede early and that is what we did.Â ""We hadn't got going. At 1-0 for the most part we were OK but clearly the game has changed on missing the penalty - if we could get back on terms who knows? ""We need to be better at managing the game and affecting the opposition."" Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough Middlesbrough boss Steve Agnew told BBC Match of the Day:""We lost the game in the first period. We defended really poorly
for two goals and gave ourselves a difficult afternoon.Â ""Weâre all disappointed with the defending and the way we conceded early goals. ""We have to go and beat Sunderland on Wednesday and move on from there. Itâs been a tough few months, certainly since our last win.Â ""We have to regroup and be ready for the Sunderland game."" Â On Gaston Ramirez's red card:""Weâre 2-0 down away from home and it becomes very difficult.Â ""We have to stay in the game but that made it tough. Once you have a yellow, you
have to be careful.""Â Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Bournemouth Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe said:""It was a great performance from us, an electric start. We were
dominant in the early stages.Â ""When you consider the importance of the game, the early goal gave us a
huge lift and dented their confidence. Luckily we didnât rest on that and got
the second goal.Â ""Iâm pleased to see the two strikers contributing goals. Itâs a
good base to build your team around. It was trademark Marc Pugh today, intricate wide play. He has a lot of quality, highlighted by his goal. ""We need more points until it [safety] is mathematically secured."" On whether he was behind the free-kick routine which led to Charlie Daniels' goal: ""I wonât take any credit for that. It was off the cuff."" Hull City 2-0 Watford Leon OsmanEx-Everton midfielder on Final Score Look at Hull's home form and their character and attitude, scrapping all game and scraping a win. An outstanding performance. Swansea 2-0 Stoke Swansea City More from Swansea manager Paul Clement:""Things are so tight and sometimes it goes for you. Having looked back at
the penalty I can't see if it is a penalty or is not. We got a bit of luck. Even the goal, it was a fantastic strike from Tom and the deflection took it right into the top corner. ""[Fernando] Llorente did well. He is not in tip top condition physically but is a big focal
point. If we get good service into him, he is a fantastic finisher.Â ""I knew at half-time it was 0-0 at Hull and they were down to 10 men. It is a terrific result for them. I
did feel it would be a game they would win. We have to concentrate on our jobs. We have
massive game next week at Old Trafford. ""I thought we needed three wins and a draw. Hull are in the driving seat
but we will chase them down until the last moment."" Swansea 2-0 Stoke Swansea City Swansea manager Paul Clement speaking to Match of the Day:""I am very proud of the team today. I am happy for our supporters as well. We have struggled in the last few games at a crucial stage of the season. ""I thought it was a must win game and Hull have won and it was absolutely right. ""If the gap had gone to five points with four to play the task would have been very difficult.Â ""Nothing changed between us and Hull but what has changed is we have got momentum now. We played terrific. We rode our luck but overall deserved to win and can look forward."" West Ham 0-0 Everton Everton Everton manager Ronald Koeman told Match of the Day:""It was really far from what we are used to, from the first minute to the last second.Â ""We didn't get the intensity. It was a poor performance with a lot of negatives.Â ""One positive is we kept a clean sheet. We like to perform to a certain level and it was far from that. ""I wasn't happy at half-time so we tried to do something. I couldn't change four, five, six or seven. But I changed two to give a signal to the team. ""We need wins now to get a chance of sixth or fifth place."" 606 phone-inBBC Radio 5 live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Why Beijing should lead on the North Korean crisis,"Mr Kim needs reining in - but will China take the lead internationally on the issue? ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results."" The quotation is attributed to Albert Einstein but after a torrid few days on the Korean peninsula, it's one for Chinese leaders to ponder. China is simply in the wrong place on North Korea. It is allowing Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions to undermine Chinese national interest. There are complex reasons for this including history, habit and political culture. But among Chinese foreign policy experts and even on social media, unease is beginning to spread. North Korea's nuclear programme has already driven South Korea to agree to the deployment of an American anti-missile system, locking Seoul deeper into a defensive triangle with Japan and the United States. What can the outside world do about N Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? Relations between Beijing and Seoul are at their worst in a quarter of a century and many South Koreans have been alienated by unofficial Chinese sanctions against the whole spectrum of South Korean interests from supermarkets to boy bands. This is good for North Korea but for no-one else. It is nonsensical for China to punish South Korea for trying to defend itself against a nuclear threat which even Beijing describes as real and urgent. And if North Korea continues its drive for nuclear weapons, there may be a worse arms race to come. A nuclear-armed Japan would hardly be in China's national interest. But despite this catalogue of warning signals and failures, China seems trapped in an unfinished history marked by binary choice: a nuclear-armed North Korea or a reunified Korea with American troops on China's border. Between these choices, it finds a nuclear-armed North Korea preferable. But if it thinks hard enough, perhaps there is an alternative. US President Donald Trump has offered China an incentive if it helps resolve the North Korean crisis In fact, this is a moment of decision for China. President Xi has talked of an Asia led by Asians. Showing flexibility and resolve on fixing Korea in the interests of the region and the world would demonstrate a readiness to lead. Almost everyone, even China's most suspicious neighbours, would be grateful. President Trump has already promised that American gratitude would take material form in a favourable trade deal. So China could use the current crisis on the Korean peninsula to engage its neighbours and cement a key area of partnership with the US. Or it could duck the challenge and let the US lead. A choice put starkly in a tweet from President Trump: ""I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the US, with its allies, will."" Of course, China's view on what constitutes ""dealing with North Korea"" does not coincide with Mr Trump's. But there will be no dealing with North Korea worth the name that does not require a fundamental shift in how Beijing sees the region and its relationships within it. China is after all an ideologically insecure one-party state. A profound aversion to liberal internationalism has tied it to a rigid position on non-interference in the internal affairs of another state. A position which now constrains it in managing the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. What's more, in Beijing's worldview, the United States is its long-term rival in Asia and the US system of alliances is a barely concealed strategy of containment. For decades, China's security planners have war-gamed scenarios of brinkmanship and conflict with the US as enemy in a zero-sum game. There are no established scenarios in which the US presents as a partner in managing a rogue state masquerading as a Chinese ally. China shares a land border with North Korea and fears the regime's collapse China and North Korea signed a mutual aid treaty in 1961. The treaty says if either ally comes under armed attack, the other should provide immediate assistance, including military support. But it also says both should safeguard peace and security. Some Chinese experts now argue that Beijing is not obliged to defend North Korea on the grounds that its nuclear weapons breach the mutual defence pact. But in general, China's security policy for the Korean peninsula seems frozen in time. Despite establishing diplomatic relations with Seoul 25 years ago, and despite the burgeoning economic relationship with South Korea which followed, the security logic has not changed. And now that China's only formal ally is threatening a nuclear war which would bring incalculable horror to the entire region including China's own citizens, Beijing's position looks a quarter century out of date. If it wants to claim leadership in Asia, it could say loudly that Pyongyang's threats are completely intolerable and must not stand. After all, what loyalty does it owe a regime which shows only contempt for Chinese diplomacy and Chinese national interest? Rather than dragging its feet on economic sanctions and turning a half-blind eye to Chinese companies which supply high-tech components to North Korea's arms programme, Beijing could choose to lead the sanctions charge. Rather than repeating tired rhetoric urging all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, it could suspend oil exports and foreign currency dealings. Rather than staging an unnecessary set piece forum on President Xi's ""one belt, one road"" slogan next month, it could host an emergency conference for Asia on dealing with North Korea. That Beijing will not lead on North Korea is China's tragedy and Asia's tragedy. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea's missile programme What can the outside world do about N Korea?

FYI - you'll find the FA Cup coverageover here.Â Adios.  Here's how it's looking after Saturday's matches. Sunderland have a couple of games in hand but look down and out. Middlesbrough's fate looks similar after their 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth. That dreaded third and final relegation place could go to Swansea or Hull. And what about Palace and Burnley? They're being pulled right into the dog fight.Â West Ham 0-0 Everton West Ham United Hammers boss Slaven Bilic told BBC Sport:""I am really pleased with the performance, I could not ask anymore from my players. In terms of effort, dedication and determination they get top marks. If any team deserved three points it was us. ""To limit them to one chance requires a lot of hard work.

Hull City 2-0 Watford Hull City Hull manager Marco Silva speaking to Premier League Productions:Â""Yes I'm really happy. It was not easy. We played with ten players, but our boys were fantastic and they deserved it.

the second goal.Â ""Iâm pleased to see the two strikers contributing goals. Itâs a
good base to build your team around. It was trademark Marc Pugh today, intricate wide play. He has a lot of quality, highlighted by his goal.

An outstanding performance. Swansea 2-0 Stoke Swansea City More from Swansea manager Paul Clement:""Things are so tight and sometimes it goes for you. Having looked back at
the penalty I can't see if it is a penalty or is not. We got a bit of luck. Even the goal, it was a fantastic strike from Tom and the deflection took it right into the top corner. ""[Fernando] Llorente did well. He is not in tip top condition physically but is a big focal
point. If we get good service into him, he is a fantastic finisher.Â ""I knew at half-time it was 0-0 at Hull and they were down to 10 men. It is a terrific result for them. I
did feel it would be a game they would win. We have to concentrate on our jobs. We have
massive game next week at Old Trafford. ""I thought we needed three wins and a draw. Hull are in the driving seat

I am happy for our supporters as well. We have struggled in the last few games at a crucial stage of the season. ""I thought it was a must win game and Hull have won and it was absolutely right. ""If the gap had gone to five points with four to play the task would have been very difficult.Â ""Nothing changed between us and Hull but what has changed is we have got momentum now.

No cut to UK aid spending - May,"Theresa May has ruled out cuts to the UK foreign aid budget if she wins the election but doubts have been cast on other existing Conservative pledges. The prime minister said the commitment to spending 0.7% of national income on aid ""will remain"" although it must be spent ""in the most effective way"". It follows speculation she was ready to drop it from the Tory manifesto. But she declined to guarantee existing spending on state pensions which ensures a minimum 2.5% annual increase. Election campaign: Friday as it happened Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted that a pledge in the 2015 Conservative manifesto not to raise income tax, VAT or National Insurance before 2020 could be abandoned. In other general election developments: Len McCluskey, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, is re-elected leader of Unite The Lib Demssay they have raised Â£500,000 in the past 48 hours Labour pledges to act over""super-sized"" primaryclass sizes Plans toraise the legal feespayable after death are axed Conservative MP David Mackintoshfaces deselection fight The 0.7% aid commitment was adopted by David Cameron when he became prime minister in 2010 and later enshrined in law. The UK has met the international target - which originates in United Nations aspirations from the 1970s - every year since 2013. There has been talk it might be among a number of high-profile policies championed by Mrs May's predecessor that she might drop to ease pressure on the public finances. But asked about its future at an election campaign event in Berkshire, Mrs May said: ""Let's be clear, the 0.7% commitment remains and will remain. ""What we need to do though is look at how that money is spent and make sure that we are able to spend that money in the most effective way."" Former chancellor George Osborne welcomed Mrs May's pledge, tweeting that it was the ""morally right"" thing to do and would maintain the UK's global ""influence"". Leading aid organisations, including Unicef and Save The Children, expressed delight at the development, which comes 24 hours after Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates warned that ending the commitment would cost lives. But the Taxpayers Alliance campaign group said it was disappointed that the ""arbitrary and meaningless"" target was not being dispensed with. Reality Check: How much does UK spend on aid? Foreign aid has been ringfenced from public spending cuts over the past seven years and has been one of the few areas to see a large increase in budgets. In 2015, the last year for which figures are available, the UK spent Â£12.1bn on overseas development assistance. This was projected to rise to Â£13.3bn in 2016. This has proved unpopular with some Tory MPs at a time of austerity in domestic public services and amid media reports about waste in certain aid projects. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said a senior Conservative source, familiar with the aid budget, refused to be drawn as to whether this amounted to an acceptance of how aid spending is currently defined, or could potentially include a broadening of what would count as aid spending in future. The triple lock is one of the government's most expensive policy commitments Asked about another of the Conservatives' 2015 election manifesto commitments - the so-called ""triple lock"" on the state pension which guarantees an annual rise of at least 2.5% - Mrs May declined to confirm it would stay in force. ""What I would say to pensioners, is just look what the Conservatives in government have done,"" she said. ""Pensioners today, Â£1,250 a year better off as a result of action that has been taken. We were very clear about the need to support people in their old age and that's exactly what we've done"". Hammond signals tax pledge may be dropped The triple lock - which pegs the state pension to annual increases in prices or earnings, whichever is higher, or a minimum of 2.5% - was introduced by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government in 2010. A review carried out by the former CBI boss John Cridland earlier this year recommended it be ended. He warned that if it remained in place, an extra 1% of GDP - equivalent to Â£19.5bn in current prices - would probably have to be spent on pensions by 2036-37. Labour, which has vowed to retain the lock and other pensioner benefits such as the winter fuel allowance if elected, said its opponents were ""abandoning older people"". Speaking in Washington DC, Mr Hammond also cast doubt on David Cameron's 2015 pledge not to raise income tax, VAT or National Insurance before 2020. He told the BBC that while no final decision had been taken, the government needed ""flexibility"" on taxes. The BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed said it was the clearest hint yet that Mr Hammond - who was forced to backtrack on his proposed Budget rise in NI contributions for the self-employed - would like to see the promise significantly amended if not ditched altogether.

Hammond hints tax pledge may be dropped,"The chancellor has given a major hint that he is no fan of the 2015 Tory manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. After the embarrassing U-turn on the attempt to raise taxes for the self-employed, Philip Hammond told me the government needed ""flexibility"" on taxes. The manifesto is not yet final, so no irreversible decisions have been taken. The chancellor said he didn't come into politics to ""increase taxes"". But it is the clearest hint yet that Mr Hammond would like to see the 2015 manifesto promise on taxes significantly amended if not abandoned all together. ""We do need flexibility to manage the system and we do need to make sure that Theresa May and her government have a clear mandate to execute our plan,"" he told me. ""All chancellors would prefer to have more flexibility in how they manage the economy and how they manage the overall tax burden down [rather] than having to have their hands constrained. ""But what we put in the manifesto will be decided in the next few days and we will publish that.""

"Lib Dems raise Â£500,000 in two days","The Lib Dems believe their opposition to Brexit gives them a distinctive message The Liberal Democrats claim to have raised more than twice as much as Labour from individual donors since a snap election was called. All parties have made cash appeals to supporters after Theresa May's surprise decision to hold an election on 8 June. The Lib Dems say they raised Â£500,000 in 48 hours. A similar Labourfund-raising drive is reported to have,externalraised Â£200,000. Labour has yet to comment on the figure, reported by the FT. The Conservatives have been contacted for details of their fundraising efforts. Election campaigning latest General election: What you need to know Lib Dem leader Tim Farron claimed activists and donors were ""flocking"" to his party on the back of its anti-Brexit message. The party, who are arguing for another referendum on the final Brexit deal, say they have seen their membership jump to 95,000, attracting 8,000 new members since Tuesday alone. The Lib Dems also raised Â£1.972m in donations in the final quarter of 2016 - more than Labour over the period. Labour saw a massive increase in membership - to more than 500,000 - after Jeremy Corbyn's election in 2015, althougha report leaked to The Guardian,externalsuggested 26,000 had left since last summer. Speaking in Swindon on Friday, Mr Corbyn said Labour had signed up a further 2,500 members since the election was called. The Lib Dems have traditionally struggled to match the Conservatives or Labour in terms of big donations and tend to spend far less on advertising at general elections than the two bigger parties. They launched an emergency fund-raising drive on Wednesday after Parliament approved Mrs May's surprise decision to seek a snap general election. The party is attempting to recover from their 2015 electoral wipe out, which saw them lose nearly 50 Commons seats. Opinion polls suggest they are unlikely to get the 57 seats they won in 2010, let alone the 62 seats they won in 2005 when Charles Kennedy was leader. Lib Dem strategists point to their success in November's Richmond Park by-election, where Sarah Olney overturned a 23,000 Tory majority, as proof they can win back constituencies which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. But critics say they could be vulnerable in existing and target seats which voted Leave in the EU referendum. Mr Farron has said only his party stood in the way of the Conservatives substantially increasing their majority. Some senior Lib Dems, including former leader Lord Ashdown, have backed co-operation with other ""progressive"" parties to keep Conservatives from winning certain seats, while the Greens have backed local electoral pacts in some seats. But the Conservatives have accused the Lib Dems of being determined to defy the will of the people and overturn Brexit. They have also warned of a ""coalition of chaos"" with Labour and the SNP, prompting the Lib Dems to distance themselves from talk of working with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament.

Do new car finance deals spell trouble?,"A growing number of people get their new car via a personal contract purchase Here is a fascinating conundrum: The price of new cars has gone up significantly in the last five years, yet they have become cheaper to drive. How can that be? The answer lies in the creative genius not of the car designers, but the financial engineers who invented a new way to borrow money. The result has been a car-buying boom the likes of which the UK has never seen. The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)are already concernedat the record Â£31.6bn we borrowed to buy cars last year. But now it appears the FCA may also be worried about the finance deals themselves. It is going to investigate what it calls ""a lack of transparency, potential conflicts of interest and irresponsible lending"" in the motor finance industry. So should car buyers be concerned as well? Until five years ago, most people would go to a bank to get a car loan, or else take out a Hire Purchase (HP) contract, paying for their car over several years. But last year 82% of new car finance deals were defined as Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP. Car sales have boomed in recent years The idea - imported from the US - has revolutionised the way we borrow. Instead of buying a car outright, a PCP allows you to rent the car over a three-year period. The money you pay merely finances the depreciation in the car's value over that timeframe, meaning you pay substantially less than if you were buying it. At the end of the three-year period you have three choices: Buy the car for its residual value, after depreciation. This is known as a ""balloon"" payment Hand the car back Roll over the residual value of the car into a new PCP on a new vehicle If you have ever wondered why there are so many new cars on the road, it is because most people choose the last option, driving out of the showroom in a shiny new model every three years. One reason PCPs have become so popular is that they price cars in monthly payments, rather than the full one-off amount. Some people liken them to mobile phone contracts. ""Everybody's got used to paying a monthly payment for a mobile phone. At two years you get an upgrade,"" says Louise Wallis, head of business management at the Retail Motor Industry Federation. ""The same psyche is beginning to happen with cars. It's just on a bigger scale."" Another reason PCPs are so popular is that they are far cheaper than traditional ways of borrowing, like HP. In the example above, driving a Ford Fiesta 1.25 Zetec would cost you Â£325 a month. The same car on HP would cost Â£423. Unlike with a PCP, at the end of the HP contract you would own the car outright. If you want to buy the car at the end of the PCP, you make the balloon payment. But there are additional restrictions. There is usually an annual mileage limit, with in this case a penalty of 6p a mile if you go over it. If you know you want to buy the car outright, HP is usually cheaper than PCP. In the example above it would save you Â£340. Jane Wells wanted to get out of a PCP contract Jane Wells, from Essex, bought a Nissan Juke on a PCP three years ago. The car cost about Â£17,000. But a year into the contract she bought a camper van, and decided she didn't need the Nissan any more. The dealership told her she would have to pay the outstanding Â£15,000 to cancel the deal, which she couldn't afford. ""The bottom line is that you can't get out of it very easily,"" she told the BBC. As a result she had to continue making the monthly payments. ""I could have been in the situation where I'd lost my job. Then where would I have been?"" As with any loan, the penalty for cancellation can be large, especially in the early stages. Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), says it works in a similar way to a repayment mortgage. ""The earlier on in a deal you are, the more capital is outstanding. So you will have more to pay if you exit early."" Finance and Leasing Association: What is a PCP?,external There is another feature of PCPs the FCA may be interested in examining. Although motorists are free to walk away at the end of an agreement, in practice dealers ring up at least six months beforehand, offering an enticing new deal. Jane Wells ended up having seven Nissans in a row: A black Note, a blue Note, a red Note, a white Note, a blue Micra, a black Micra Cabriolet and the Juke. ""Every time they phoned me and said would you like another car, I was silly enough to go 'alright then'. When you wanted to end that cycle of having a new car after new car, it was very difficult to get out of it."" The FCA may certainly question whether this is a market in which competition is working properly. However since PCPs are regulated by the FCA, they do offer customers plenty of protection. If things go wrong, and a borrower cannot afford the repayments, they may also prove less costly than an HP agreement or a personal loan. Mark Lavery says personal loans are more risky than PCPs Mark Lavery, chief executive of Cambria Automobiles, says personal loans are much more risky. ""You're on the hook for that debt; the way PCPs work, you're not. If you take a personal loan or an overdraft, in my opinion that's where the risk is."" The Finance and Leasing Association is also insistent that dealers are lending responsibly. However evidence gathered by the credit reference agency Experian suggests the biggest growth in applications for PCPs is coming from those whose finances are already stretched. That may leave plenty for the Bank - and the regulator- to worry about. But motorists too may want to think carefully about who's really in the driving seat when they exit the showroom.

Sun prints apology to Ross Barkley,"Ross Barkley's grandfather was born in Nigeria The Sun hasprinted an apology,externalto Everton and England footballer Ross Barkley over an article in which its former editor Kelvin MacKenzie compared him to a gorilla. The newspaper said it had been unaware of Mr Barkley's heritage and there was ""never any slur intended"". The 23-year-old footballer's grandfather was born in Nigeria. The Sun said it had been contacted by Mr Barkley's lawyers, who had made a formal complaint about the piece. In the article, published on 14 April, Mr MacKenzie said looking at Mr Barkley's eyes had given him a ""similar feeling when seeing a gorilla at the zoo"". His eyes made him ""certain not only are the lights not on, there is definitely nobody at home"", he wrote. Alongside the article, was an image of a gorilla next to a picture of the midfielder. The columnist is currently suspended by the newspaper. The Sun's apology, printed on page five of the paper, said that as soon as Mr Barkley's background was drawn to its attention, the article was removed from its website. The apology did not extend to other elements of the article, in which Mr MacKenzie suggested that the only people in Liverpool who could earn as much as footballers were drug dealers. Kelvin McKenzie has said it is ""beyond parody"" to call his article racist On Friday, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said Mr McKenzie would be facing questions from the police about the article. Mr Anderson described it as a ""racial slur... and something we won't tolerate"". A spokesman for Merseyside Police said its investigation was ongoing and officers would be speaking to relevant witnesses. Mr MacKenzie was approached for a comment but is on holiday, although previously he has said it is ""beyond parody"" to describe his column as racist. The Sun, which has previously apologised for the ""wrong"" and ""unfunny"" views of Mr MacKenzie expressed in the column, has said he will be ""fully investigated"" on his return. The Sun apology in full: ""On April 14 we published a piece in the Kelvin MacKenzie column about footballer Ross Barkley which made unfavourable comparisons between Mr Barkley and a gorilla. ""At the time of publication, the newspaper was unaware of Mr Barkley's heritage and there was never any slur intended. ""As soon as his background was drawn to our attention, the article was removed from online. ""We have been contacted by lawyers on behalf of Ross Barkley, who has made a formal complaint about the piece. ""The Sun has apologised for the offence caused by the piece.

It's made from a recipe typically including oatmeal and yeast and turns out looking rather like a dirty flannel. But don't let that put you off. People in the Potteries love them. They'vesent us questionsabout their history and appeal and told us how they've taken their oatcakes across the world. Oatcakes are often served with savoury delights, including bacon, mushrooms and lashings of cheese Michael Collins is a born-and-bred Stokie and started eating Staffordshire oatcakes about 60 years ago. He calls them ""food from the gods"". As a youngster he would dip a rolled-up oatcake in bacon fat from his Saturday morning breakfast. ""It tasted lovely, almost better than the bacon itself."" This self-confessed ""superfan"" faced disaster when one of Stoke-on-Trent's beloved oatcake shops,Hanley's Hole in the Wall, shut in 2012. He could no longer get his oatcake fix from the business where customers had queued at the window of a house to satisfy their craving. After enduring weeks of supermarket-bought products, he found a local bakery making oatcakes and hasn't looked back. Oatcakes were produced in the ""traditional way"" at Hanley's Hole in the Wall Michael even got his neighbours hooked, such is his love of them. Another superfan, Jan Lacey, from Kidsgrove, says she takes oatcakes on holidays to Cornwall - including for family members living in the South West. She passed on her love of the ""Tunstall tortilla"" by weaning her now 28-year-old son on them as a baby in his pushchair at Wolstanton Social Club. If you've not sampled a Staffordshire oatcake, they have the texture and consistency of a pancake but with a more oat-like taste. The main reason cited by many in the Potteries for the huge appeal is their ability to go with both sweet and savoury toppings - one day you eat them with cheese and tomato, the next with strawberry jam. Where are England's steepest streets? The rise and rise of urban beekeeping 'Merry Christmas' Victorian style Think this oatcake is only found in Staffordshire? Think again. Larraine Eastwood has taken the oatcake to Canada Larraine Eastwood has taken them to Canada for her family. ""The look of bliss on their faces was incredible."" It all started in the early 1970s when, visiting her expat relatives in Nepean, Ottawa, she asked what they wanted. Staffordshire oatcakes came back as the unanimous first choice. Pancake-like oatcakes, such as these, are distinctive to Staffordshire A type of savoury pancake made from oatmeal, flour and yeast Staffordshire oatcakes are not to be confused with Scottish oatcakes, which are more biscuit-like The oatcakes, which look similar to pancakes, can be eaten with savoury or sweet toppings Favourites include bacon; cheese; mushrooms; syrup; jam; and chocolate spread Local nicknames include Potteries poppadom, Tunstall tortilla and Clay suzette There are records as early as the 17th Century of the oatcake in Staffordshire During the trip she was ""terrified"", at 21, of being stopped by customs officers. But she managed to hand over the ""precious cargo"" to her aunt. As oatcakes were served at breakfast to every invited expat, tears could be seen. ""It was like they were biting into a part of their hometown,"" she recalls. For those people who don't have Potteries relatives to deliver them oatcakes, local producer Povey Oatcakes says it will send the product overseas - although this can cost a lot. Another business, High Lane Oatcakes, says while it does not ship overseas, plenty of people buy its wares to send abroad. Vanessa Carroll, now living in the US, makes her own oatcakes Vanessa Carroll doesn't bother importing them to her US home or wait for a relative to visit sunny Arizona. She turns on the hob and makes her own. Vanessa, a former resident of Congleton, just over the border in Cheshire, ""grew an addiction to them"". Having crossed the Atlantic, it was while reminiscing about the delicacy she decided to find a recipe online. After perfecting her technique - years of English pancake flipping came in handy - Vanessa says her US friends are ""total converts"". ""That is the lucky few I invite to join us for breakfast,"" she says. Jeff Shaw is another Staffordshire exile, who has created his own recipe Jeff Shaw, who formerly lived near Porthill, Staffordshire, has spent years working on his unique blend of ingredients. Aged seven, he used to make oatcake deliveries. Ingredients: 1lb 4oz (567g) medium coarse oatmeal 12oz (340g) strong white plain flour Three tbsp dried skimmed milk 4 tsp quick act dried yeast 2 tsp sugar Full method here on the BBC website Work took him to Shetland where, finding other Stoke-on-Trent expats, an old recipe was discovered and Jeff began making his own. Such was his desire for the perfect oatcake, special frying pans were bought. When work saw him move again, this time to Aberdeen, he took his special recipe with him and the advent of social media sent it global. Requests have come via Facebook from folk as far afield as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai, he says. A global phenomenon? It appears the Staffordshire oatcake's appeal has truly crossed the world.

Why are farmers in India protesting with mice?,"Chinnagodangy Palanisamy says he will be forced to eat mice if the farm crisis doesn't end Last week, Chinnagodangy Palanisamy, 65, held a live mouse between his teeth to draw the government's attention to the plight of farmers in his native state of Tamil Nadu. ""I and my fellow farmers were trying to convey the message that we will be forced to eat mice if things don't improve,"" he told me, sitting in a makeshift tent near Delhi's Jantar Mantar observatory, one of the areas of the Indian capital where protests are permitted. The tatty tent and the street outside have been home to Mr Palanisamy and his 100-odd fellow farmers for some 40 days now. They hail fromdrought-affected districts of the southern state of Tamil Nadu,external, one of India's most developed states. It appears to be a drought that India forgot, so Mr Palanisamy and his spirited co-protesters mounted a unique, eye-catching protest to put pressure on the government to act. They are demanding ample drought relief funds, pensions for elderly farmers, awaiver on the repayment of crop and farm loans,external, better prices for their crops and theinterlinking of rivers,externalto irrigate their lands. Wearing traditional sarong-like garments and turbans, these farmers have brandished human skulls that they claim belong to dead farmers. They have held live mice in their mouths, shaved half their heads, worn women's traditional saris, slashed their hands and oozed ""protest blood"", rolled bare-bodied on boiling hot macadam, and conducted mock funerals. The protesters said these skulls belonged to farmers who took their lives More than 100 farmers from Tamil Nadu have protested in Delhi for some 40 days The protesters have also eaten food off the road, andstripped near the prime minister's office,externalin the heart of the city after they were reportedly refused a meeting. Fire-fighters rescued a protester who tied a noose around his neck and tried to hang himself from a tree at the venue. Many of them have been taken to the hospital and treated for acute dehydration. Some complain that the famously inward-looking Delhi media have painted their protest as an exotic freak show, often missing the pain and desperation driving it. One commentatorwrote,externalthat the protest had taken on a ""farcical proportion where the performance seems to have become the point of it, and the protest itself is lost"". India drought: '330 million people affected' Searching for water in drought-hit Latur Is India facing its worst-ever water crisis? India's water refugees who live in cattle camps In Tamil Nadu, where more than 40% of the people make a living from farming, lack of water due to poor rainfall, low crop prices, and dwindling access to formal credit has created what is possibly the state's worst agrarian crisis in decades. The jury is out on whether this protest will fetch results. India, after all, has seen many abortive uprisings. But this Delhi protest shines the spotlight on how drought, debt and dysfunctional policies continue to blight India's farmers: agriculture growth has shrunk to a worrying 1.2%, and tens of thousands of farmers are struggling with debt and little income. There was a time not so long ago, recounts Mr Palanisamy, when his 4.5-acre farm in Tiruchirappalli would yield abundant rice, sugarcane, pulses and cotton. There was also a bountiful crop of fruit from his mango and coconut trees. Crippled by a debilitating drought brought on by years of poor rainfall, Mr Palanisamy's farm is now largely barren. Two of his sons, who helped their father farm, have been forced to take up small jobs to keep the home fires burning. There's no money to pay his five workers. Loans worth 6,00,000 rupees ($9,287; Â£7,247) have piled up, and he's already pawned a lot of family gold as collateral. Many protesters slashed their hands Tamil Nadu has been in a grip of drought for more than two years ""This is the worst farm crisis I have seen in my lifetime,"" says Mr Palanisamy, a second generation farmer, whose lean and sinewy frame belies his age. ""I have never lived through such a crisis."" Many haven't. Fifty-eight debt-stricken farmers have taken their lives in drought-affected districts in Tamil Nadu since October, according to officials. A local farmers association insists the number of farm-related suicides and death of farmers is more than 250. One of them is Mr Palanisamy's own brother-in-law who fell ill, refused treatment, and ""wasted himself to death"" in November. He was crushed under loans that he had taken out to buy a tractor and a bore well to irrigate his five-acre farm. Led by a charismatic sixty-something farmer-lawyer, the protesters at Jantar Mantar have unwavering spirit. Most of them, like Mr Palanisamy, took a train ride to Delhi in March and found the weather ""rather cold"". At night, many of them slept fitfully in the open, enduring mosquito bites. The farmers tell stories of their denuded villages where lack of water has left their trees bare and the landscape barren. They swap stories of mounting crop loans taken from banks and money lenders. They rave and rant in their dog-eared diaries. On some days, the mercury soars to 45C (113F) Some of them complain that the media is more interested in the spectacle than the problem. They are men and women of dignity who have fought hard all their lives against all odds. The fire brigade rescued this protester who tried to take his own life Mr Palanisamy, for example, belongs to a hunter-gatherer tribe, among the most underprivileged people in India. He studied until high school, picked up a certificate as a recognised farm teacher, and was employed at an anganwadi - a government sponsored mother and child-care centre - until his retirement even as he tilled his farm. His three sons have been equally hardworking - two of them have earned degrees in engineering - and have helped their father in the farm. His brother-in-law, who took his life, used the money he earned from farming to send his only daughter to a nursing school. They are symbols of the hard-fought social mobility of India's poorest, and also examples of how a long-drawn farm crisis can return them to a precarious existence. The farmers say they won't budge until the government agrees to their demands When dusk falls, and the noise recedes, Mr Palanisamy sometimes takes out his diary and scribbles furiously. He said he recently wrote some verse, remembering the hard times back home. It is a haunting elegy for farming in India: It's dead/it's dead/Farming is dead It's agony/it's agony/This death of farming It's burning/it's burning The farmers heart and belly Stop this/stop this These farmers' deaths LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?
