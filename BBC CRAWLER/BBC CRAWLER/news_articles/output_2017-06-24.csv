Cladding fire tests failed by 34 blocks,"This video can not be played Watch: Camden resident confronts council chief Cladding on 34 tower blocks in 17 council areas in England has failed fire safety tests, the government says. So far, every sample has failed the tests. The government plans to examine cladding from up to 600 blocks. The updated figures came as people from the Chalcots Estate in Swiss Cottage, north London, spent a second night away from their homes. But - across the country - not every block that fails safety tests will be evacuated. Four of the five blocks on the Chalcots Estate were evacuated on Friday because of fears over cladding, gas pipes, and fire doors. Camden Council said it had no option but to move residents from 650 flats while work takes place. Council leader Georgia Gould said staff would continue asking those who had not yet left to vacate their flats. ""By remaining in the blocks these residents risk delaying the work that is required and that we are undertaking to make these homes safe. ""It is not safe to remain in these blocks and our residents' safety will continue to be the council's number one priority."" Almost 200 offers of accommodation have been made to displaced residents, and most of these have been taken up. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid - while agreeing with the decision in Camden - said: ""A failure in testing of the cladding does not necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated. ""The decision by Camden council was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures."" This video can not be played Watch: Meet Rosie, who refused to leave Taplow Tower in Camden Plymouth is one of the affected areas. The elected leader of the city council, Ian Bowyer, said: ""We are not proposing to evacuate... ""The failures that have been attributed to the blocks in Camden are not present here in the three tower blocks in Plymouth."" The Local Government Association said some councils have introduced 24-hour warden patrols to mitigate the risk before cladding is removed. The Department for Communities and Local Government's testing programme, which began on Wednesday, is able to test 100 samples a day. If needed, further lab capability could be provided. Mr Javid said testing was taking place ""around the clock"". Although every sample has failed the test so far, he pointed out that local authorities have been asked to prioritise buildings they had most concern over. Seven of the 17 local authorities where high-rise buildings have failed fire safety tests have been named. They are: Camden - where residents have been evacuated from four blocks on the Chalcots Estate Brent - where a housing association tower block, Elizabeth House, has cladding but London Fire Brigade advises it is not a risk Barnet - where cladding put up on three towers in Granville Road, NW2, in 2012 is to be removed as precautionary measure Hounslow - where Clements Court tower in Cranford is to have outer cladding removed Manchester - where 78 panels are being removed from one area of theVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe Salford - where cladding is also to be removed from nine tower blocks Plymouth - where three blocks on theMount Wise Tower estatewere found to have cladding made from similar material to Grenfell Tower Portsmouth - where the city council is removing cladding fromHoratia House and Leamington House in Somerstown The Chalcots Estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79 people. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. One flat destroyed in London fire Confusion and anger after evacuation Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer After the evacuation, emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. Camden Council - which said it already spent Â£500,000 on hotel rooms - said it would reimburse residents who have paid for their own temporary accommodation. It has also set aside Â£100,000 for food and essential items for displaced residents. Fire crews have been put on watch at the Chalcots estate The work at Chalcots is expected to take three to four weeks. Sayed Mead, a resident on the estate who left his flat, told BBC Breakfast that not knowing where he was going to be housed had been ""eating me away"". He was eventually told at midnight on Saturday where he and his mother can stay, and said it felt like ""I'm going to start my life all over again"". He also said the council had created ""panic"" among the residents. Despite being urged to leave, around 20 households had refused to vacate their homes by Saturday evening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said councils across the country needed to deal ""swiftly and effectively with the scale of the fire safety challenge"" posed by the Grenfell Tower fire. ""This is now a nationwide threat and the prime minister needs to get a grip,"" he added. Do you live in one of the tower blocks that have failed fire cladding safety tests?

Acid attack model returns to work,"Ms Notaro said on Facebook that sea lions had given her strength in the aftermath of her trauma A former Miss Italy finalist has returned to work as a sea lion trainer, five months after being severely disfigured by acid thrown in her face. Gessica Notaro, 28, said that she was doing so to encourage other women to fight back against bullying. She posted a picture of herself on social media with sea lions at the aquarium where she works in east Italy. Her former boyfriend is being prosecuted over the attack but denies any involvement. Ms Notaro is scheduled to host the aquarium's night-time performances later this year at the Adriatic resort of Rimini. Gessica Notaro braves TV show The women fighting back after acid attacks She was in danger of losing the sight in her left eye in the aftermath of the attack. Ms Notaro has had several operations since, and her injured eye remains bandaged. In a Facebook post she said: ""My strength? Here it is,"" as she touched a sea lion. Ms Notaro appeared on the Canale 5 show in April with talk show host Maurizio Costanzo Ms Notaro's story caught the public imagination when she revealed her suffering on social media. In April she went on national TV to denounce former boyfriend Jorge Edson Tavares. ""I want you to see what he did to me. This isn't love,"" she said. ""While the acid ate away at my face I was on my knees praying to God to take away my beauty but at least leave me with my sight."" Ms Notaro broke up with Mr Tavares last summer. After she went to police to complain that she was being stalked, a restraint order was imposed on him. On 10 January the former finalist was doused in hydrochloric acid by a man she identified as Mr Tavares. He has strenuously denied any involvement in the attack.

Trump accuses Obama of inaction on Russia,"Mr Trump said the Russian investigation should focus on the Obama administration President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of inaction over alleged Russian interference in the US election in 2016. Mr Trump said Mr Obama had learned well before the 8 November poll about the accusations and ""did nothing"". His comments followed an article in the Washington Post which said that Mr Obama learned last August of President Vladimir Putin's ""direct involvement"". The alleged meddling is the subject of high-level investigations in the US. President Putin has repeatedly denied any Russian interference into the presidential election. The Washington Post article,externalsays Mr Obama was told early last August by sources deep within the Russian government that Mr Putin was directly involved in a cyber campaign to disrupt the election, injure Hillary Clinton and aid a Trump victory. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded The Post said Mr Obama secretly debated dozens of options to punish Russia but in the end settled on what it called symbolic measures - the expulsion of 35 diplomats and closure of two Russian compounds. They came in late December, well after the election. The Post reported that Mr Obama was concerned he might himself be seen as trying to manipulate the election. The paper quoted a former administration official as saying: ""From national security people there was a sense of immediate introspection, of, 'Wow, did we mishandle this'."" Legal 'dream team' probing Trump What is the special counsel looking into?,external Measures Mr Obama had considered but which were not put into action included planting cyber weapons in the Russian infrastructure and releasing information personally damaging to Mr Putin. Imagine, for a moment, that you're Barack Obama in August 2016. You've just been informed by the CIA that Vladimir Putin has ordered a wide-ranging effort to disrupt the US presidential election. What do you do? Mr Obama responded in typical fashion - cautiously. He alerted state officials, warned Russia and attempted (unsuccessfully) to fashion a bipartisan response with Republicans in Congress. Now the second-guessing has begun. Some Democrats are saying the Obama team should have gone public with such a startling discovery before election day. The president feared such a move would prompt the Republican nominee to accuse him of meddling and undermine faith in the electoral process. He believed Mrs Clinton was going to win anyway, so it was best not to rock the boat. Mr Trump himself is now questioning why Mr Obama didn't do more - a curious position given that he recently described the Russia hacking story as a Democratic ""hoax"". These latest revelations add yet another wrinkle to a 2016 campaign that will be hashed and rehashed for the foreseeable future. The most pressing question now, however, is not what Mr Obama did. It's what the US government does next. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: ""The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?"" He followed that up with two more tweets on Saturday, the second saying: ""Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?"" He repeats the argument in an interview with Fox News, which will air on Sunday. ""If he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. But you don't read that. It's quite sad."" This video can not be played Russia probe is ""ridiculous"" - Trump Allegations of collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials during the election have dogged the president's first five months in office. He has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling the investigations a ""witch hunt"". US investigators are looking into whetherRussian cyber hackers targetedUS electoral systems to help Mr Trump win. US media say special counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice over the Russia inquiries. They involve the president's firing of FBI chief James Comey, who led one of the inquiries, and Mr Trump's alleged attempt to end a probe into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Corbyn draws crowds at Glastonbury,"This video can not be played The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis Jeremy Corbyn said he had been inspired by how many young people had got involved in politics as he addressed the crowd at the Glastonbury festival. ""Do you know, politics is actually about everyday life?"" he asked the Pyramid Stage audience who had, moments earlier, been dancing to Craig David. The Labour leader called for ""a world of human rights, peace, justice and democracy all over the planet"". The speech was watched by tens of thousands across the festival site. At the Pyramid Stage, supporters and activists surged to the front of the crowd holding placards, and a chorus of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" - sung to the tune of Seven Nation Army by former Glastonbury headliners The White Stripes. Mr Corbyn was not without his dissenters among the large crowd, with some boos heard during the speech and small pockets of the audience walking away towards the end. But he received loud cheers for comments on equality (""We need to challenge sexism in our society, and homophobia, and any form of discrimination that goes on"") and refugees (""Let's support them in their hour of need and not see them as a threat and danger""). Mr Corbyn posed for photos with festival-goers at Glastonbury Mr Corbyn also commented on the recent election, which saw Prime Minister Theresa May's majority cut in the House of Commons, following a vote in which the turnout among young people was reported to have increased dramatically. ""The elites got it wrong,"" he said. ""The politics that got out of the box is not going back in that box"". He added that he was ""inspired"" by the number of young voters who got involved for the first time. That the Labour leader was given a rock star welcome was, perhaps, unsurprising at the overwhelmingly left-leaning music festival. Katy Perry crowdsurfs festival-goers Radiohead mesmerise Glastonbury Dizzee Rascal: I should be headlining Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Organiser Michael Eavis, who invited Mr Corbyn to appear, introduced him on stage, saying: ""At last we have a leader to put in place all the issues we've been campaigning for for 40 years"". The festival, which is run as a non-profit event, supports causes including Greenpeace, Oxfam and WaterAid. Artists appearing at the festival have spoken of their support of Mr Corbyn's politics, while Friday night's headliners Radiohead commented during their set: ""See you later, Theresa. Just shut the door on your way out."" Radiohead performed as the headline act on Friday Rapper Dizzee Rascal told the BBC he was a fan: ""He comes across quite genuine.

"'I wanted out,' says Prince Harry","The Mail on Sunday,externalsays Prince Harry once ""wanted out"" of the Royal Family, and considered living an ""ordinary"" life. In an interview, Harry says that when he was at Eton he just wanted to be a ""bad boy"" - and after he left the army he didn't want to grow up. But the prince changed his mind and decided to find a role for himself - and, he says, was primarily motivated by his loyalty to the Queen. The Observer,externalsays the government has made a U-turn on fire safety in new schools, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The paper understands previous guidance, which has now been dropped, didn't require sprinklers to be installed. According to the paper the move is evidence of a dramatic shift across government; from a previous preoccupation with deregulation and cost-cutting, to a safety-first attitude. The Sun on Sunday,externalsays the prime minister has sent for the former foreign secretary and Conservative leader, Lord Hague, to ""rebuild"" the shattered Tory brand. The paper understands that Mrs May has a place for him in an inner circle of advisers, and that she would like to harness his experience to avoid a repeat of the ""foul-ups"" which led to the party losing its majority. The boss of one of Britain's largest NHS trusts has toldThe Sunday Times,externalthat patients who are dying should be allowed to go on a final holiday with their family, rather than be subjected to gruelling treatment. Professor Marcel Levi, the chief executive of University College London Hospitals, believes that sometimes the NHS is wasting time and money.

Foo Fighters finally headline Glastonbury,"Foo Fighters have finally stepped onto Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, two years after they were forced to pull out of the festival. Days before their headline performance in 2015, Dave Grohl fell off stage and broke his leg in Gothenburg, Sweden. ""I'm about two years late tonight, I'm sorry,"" said Grohl on Saturday, blaming bad traffic for the delay. He then played a solo version of Times Like These, bringing in the band for an explosive climax. Watch the Foo Fighters on the BBC Glastonbury site The Foo Fighters' long road to headlining Glastonbury Grohl explained the song held special significance when it came to their Glastonbury experience. He recalled watching Florence + The Machine stand in for the Foo Fighters in 2015, ""on my laptop, as I was sitting in a wheelchair with a broken leg. ""It looked beautiful. And all of a sudden, she played a Foo Fighters song... way better than we've ever played a Foo Fighters song, let me tell you. ""So I thought I'd come out here and start the show tonight singing that song back to Florence."" Earlier this week, Grohl told BBC Radio 1 that playing Times Like These at Glastonbury would be ""part of my recovery in a weird way."" The band continued their set with All My Life and Learn to Fly - an exhilarating one-two punch of riff-laden rock. ""I think tonight we should just play until they kick us off the stage,"" said Grohl. ""You know we can do it."" BBC Glastonbury - watch and listen to the festival live Katy Perry crowdsurfs and Craig David triumphs Dizzee: 'I should headline Glastonbury' The cheapest pint at Glastonbury Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Grohl started out as the drummer in Nirvana, but these days it's hard to imagine a time when he wasn't a frontman. Whether thrashing his guitar, strutting around the stage or teasing the crowd, his charisma spills over. At one point, he sang an improvised song entirely consisting of one repeated swear word, just so he could break Adele's record for the most obscenities said on stage at Glastonbury. Grohl seemed to be having the night of his life And after the band played Walk, about ""learning to walk again"", he joked: ""I'd like to dedicate that last song to my surgeonâ¦ my plastic surgeon. ""I went to him and I said, 'I know I have a broken leg - but could you make me look older. And voila."" As Grohl scrolled through a mini-history of the Foo Fighters' hits (The Pretender, My Hero, Monkey Wench), it became clear the band have one setting: Supersonic. Even the quiet songs somehow ended up loud. But their catchy pop-rock choruses and Grohl's investment in his band kept the crowd on side throughout the two-and-a-quarter hour set. Spirits didn't even sag when drummer Taylor Hawkins stepped out from behind his kit to sing a version of Queen and David Bowie's Under Pressure. David Beckham and his son Brooklyn watched from the side of the stage In fact, their bonhomie almost worked too well. During a pause in Best Of You, the audience picked up the song's ""woah-oh"" refrain and sang it back to the band for a good three minutes. ""Would you let me finish the song, please?"" pleaded Grohl. ""Shhh."" They eventually overran by 20 minutes, finishing their set just after the Pyramid Stage's midnight curfew with a firework-assisted Everlong. ""I feel like this is the big one,"" said Grohl. ""I feel it's the way it's supposed to be."" ""Thank you so much. It was a beautiful night."" Elsewhere on Friday night, Solange played a mellow, subtly choreographed set on the West Holts stage. Her performance drew heavily on last year's hit album A Seat At The Table, a soulful, thoughtful portrayal of the struggles faced by black women throughout history. Stormzy marked himself out as a future headliner during his Other Stage performance British grime star Stormzy gave a powerful performance to a packed-out audience at The Other Stage. Alongside his own hits, including Big For Your Boots and Shut Up, he played Ed Sheeran's Shape Of You - on which he provided a guest rap at this year's Brit Awards. ""We're going to sing for Ed right now,"" he said, encouraging the audience to go and see the pop star's headline set on Sunday night. ""We're going to let him know we got him tomorrow."" Stormzy also dedicated the song 100 Bags to his mum, saying she  ""wouldn't be able to comprehend"" her son playing to 20,000 people at Glastonbury. ""Hey, mumzy, look at your boy now,"" he said. Throughout, the star's set embraced his mainstream appeal without diluting the fierce and dextrous wordplay that made him special in the first place.

Outrage as US 'invents' the sausage roll,"Does Trader Joe's new dish remind you of anything? There has been a British outcry on social media after a US chain claimed to have invented a new summer snack that looks suspiciously like a sausage roll. Supermarket Trader Joe's has called it the ""Puff Dog"". Los Angeles-based lifestyle website Hello Giggles said it was ""genius"". However, the UK's The Mirror newspaper was less impressed. ""Sausage roll given ridiculous new name,"" read its headline on Saturday. Although other European countries also have a centuries-old fondness for meat wrapped in pastry, the UK has made the sausage roll its own. British bakery chain Greggs sells more than 2.5 million of them every week. It is typically sausage meat wrapped in puff pastry, although the Puff Dog has opted to use beef. Hello Giggles could have saved itself the backlash by looking in its own archive. In 2015, it covered a previous twitterstorm when the New York Timespublished a sausage roll recipe,external. ""There are two sides to the social media storm that ensued following the release of the recipe. Americans don't know what a sausage roll is, and the Brits can't believe we haven't experienced them yet,""wrote,externalHello Giggles at the time. Americans are often more familiar with their version of ""pigs in blankets"" - a sausage wrapped in hard pastry, as opposed to puff pastry. In the UK, ""pigs in blankets"" are sausages wrapped in bacon, which are often served with Christmas dinner. The British version of ""pigs in blankets"" seen on the left-hand side of the plate Yet can the UK really claim the last laugh? Earlier this year, a large part of the Spanish-speaking world was amused when the UK's Costa Coffee chain appeared to conceive the cortado coffee. The cortado - a small coffee with a dash of milk - has long been popular in cafes from Spain to Argentina. Yet sandwich boards spotted outside Costa Coffee in April heralded: ""The next big thing in coffee."" ""2017: England invents the cortado,""read one widely shared, tongue-in-cheek tweet,external(in Spanish), accompanied by a picture of the advert. ""Clearly, the recurring Gibraltar issue is not the only pending dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom,""joked Spanish news site 20 Minutos,external. Meanwhile, a civil war was almost sparked earlier this month when the BBC started its own in-fight over pasties. Prince Charles enjoying a Cornish pasty on a trip to Cornwall BBC Radio Devon teased its colleagues over the country border in Cornwall by suggesting, on Twitter, that the Cornish pasty - its beloved meat-and-potato pastry - hailed from Devon. It came after one of the station's guests referenced a study by historian Dr Todd Gray from Exeter (which is in Devon), who says he can trace the earliest record of the pasty to 16th-Century Devon. BBC Radio Cornwall was outraged and tweeted back a warning against ever questioning the Cornish pasties origins.

Parliament hit by cyber-attack,"Parliament has been hit by a cyber attack, officials at Westminster say. The ""sustained"" hack began on Friday night, prompting officials to disable remote access to the emails of MPs, peers and their staff as a safeguard. The parliamentary authorities said hackers had mounted a ""determined attack"" on all user accounts ""in an attempt to identify weak passwords"". Government sources say it appeared the attack has been contained but it will ""remain vigilant"". A parliamentary spokeswoman said they were investigating the attack and liaising with the National Cyber Security Centre. She said: ""We have discovered unauthorised attempts to access accounts of parliamentary networks users... ""Parliament has robust measures in place to protect all of our accounts and systems, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect and secure our network. ""As a precaution we have temporarily restricted remote access to the network."" IT services on the parliamentary estate are working normally and a message sent to MPs urges them to be ""extra vigilant"". But a number of MPs have confirmed to the BBC they are not able to access their parliamentary email accounts outside of the Westminster estate. It comes just over a month after48 of England's NHS trusts were hit by a cyber-attack. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said: ""We have seen reports in the last few days of even Cabinet ministers' passwords being for sale online. ""We know that our public services are attacked so it is not at all surprising that there should be an attempt to hack into parliamentary emails. ""And it's a warning to everybody, whether they are in Parliament or elsewhere, that they need to do everything possible to maintain their own cyber security."" The latest attack was publicly revealed by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennardon Twitter,externalas he asked his followers to send any ""urgent messages"" to him by text. Henry Smith, Tory MP for Crawley, latertweeted:,external""Sorry no parliamentary email access today - we're under cyber attack from Kim Jong Un, (Vladimir) Putin or a kid in his mom's basement or something..."" The government's National Security Strategy said in 2015 that the threat from cyber-attacks from both organised crime and foreign intelligence agencies was one of the ""most significant risks to UK interests"". The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, started its operations in October last year. The National Crime Agency said it was working with the NCSC but the centre was ""leading the operational response"".

Footballer sought over fan knife threat,"The match at Sawbridgeworth Town's Crofters End ground was abandoned after 95 minutes A non-league footballer who allegedly brandished a knife at an opposition fan is being sought by police. Hertfordshire Police said it was looking for Aidan Chaves in connection with ""an incident of affray"" in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire. The game between Sawbridgeworth Town and Clapton FC on 25 March was abandoned. It followed reports a player appeared to get a  knife out after being spat at by a Clapton fan. Mr Chaves is believed to be in Hertfordshire. Police said the 26-year-old also had connections to London. The Essex Senior League match, taking place at Sawbridgeworth's Crofters End ground, was abandoned after 95 minutes. Following the match Sawbridgeworth Town said a player's registration had been terminated. A spokesman for the club said the player in question would ""never represent"" them again and had been given a life ban from the ground.

Confusion and anger after evacuation,"This video can not be played Watch: Meet Rosie, who refused to leave Taplow Tower It would seem like a typical Saturday morning with children jumping on climbing frames outside Swiss Cottage leisure centre in north London. But every so often, a family walks by carrying bags and suitcases, not quite sure where they will be living in the next few weeks. Urged to evacuate the nearby tower blocks overnight, they have come to the centre after a chaotic night of mixed messages in a bid to get their questions answered. ""Why can't they stay in their flats? Where will they be moved to? And how long will it take for life to get back to normal?"" Those questions and dozens of others are being asked by the residents of 650 flats in Camdenwho were evacuated at short notice from their homes over fire safety concerns,following the Grenfell Tower blaze nine days earlier. The local council says it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate - and that, after taking advice from the fire service, it had no option but to ask the residents of four of those blocks to move out temporarily. Many occupants feel like the evacuation is an overreaction and firmly believe they could stay in their flats while the remedial work takes place. Eileen Mulcahy says she does not want to be rehoused too far away from the estate Laura Mulcahy, 29, is holding a sheet that confirms she has registered her grandparents, Eileen, 71, and William, 75, to be rehoused from the Dorney block. ""It's a joke,"" she says. ""No-one knows what is going on. My grandad is still in there. They've told us to go back and get grandad. People are still in the block."" Eileen adds: ""I don't want to be sent miles away. I feel like I might have a heart attack. My husband can't cope. He kept heaving all night because of the stress."" Through the window of the leisure centre, staff in high visibility jackets hold mobile phones to their ears and tap away on laptops trying to book hotel rooms or any other available temporary accommodation for the residents. Several of those evacuated from their homes at short notice had to spend the night here, sleeping on mattresses. Some locals decided to take matters into their own hands and instead stayed with relatives rather than on a gym floor. Giulia Mummolo says she feels unsafe in her flat ever since the Grenfell Tower blaze in North Kensington Giulia Mummolo, 24, who lives on the 16th floor of the Taplow Tower, came back to her block to pack some belongings after staying with a friend. She has already found herself a new place to live after making the decision to move out of her block following the Grenfell Tower blaze. Cladding fire tests failed by 27 blocks Residents react: 'I'm angry' 'Evacuation the right decision' She says: ""It's not very pleasant. The only thing is I wasn't feeling safe in the building. I think it's a shame that only now things are happening. ""These buildings should not be built. It's all been very confusing. We found out about the evacuation from an article. No-one called me. ""I've already found a place to live so I've just got to speed up the process. After the fire at Grenfell I didn't feel safe. On the 16th floor, what can you do? ""Even if they make the changes there's not much they can do in four weeks."" Staff wearing high visibility jackets help residents evacuated to the leisure centre The playground remains busy with parents and children - who have had their Saturday swimming lessons cancelled at the centre - enjoying the outdoor facilities. Every so often, a resident walks past with a suitcase after finally securing some accommodation in a B&B, vacant apartment or hotel. But several refuse to be moved out of their tower blocks. Rosie Turner, 27, walks out of the leisure centre carrying her nine-week-old baby, AJ, after staying the night in her 14th floor flat in Taplow Tower. ""I came home yesterday and was told I had to evacuate. I came to the centre to register and they told me I would have to stay on an air bed,"" she says. ""It's not right. AJ hasn't had one needle and how am I meant to sterilise his bottles?"" ""I'm willing to take the risk than stay in there. They've told me to go to the Docklands but how am I supposed to get to and from there? ""I'm still in the house and I'm not going unless they put me somewhere local."" Izac Tsai says he feels in limbo after receiving conflicting messages about staying in his tower block home Izac Tsai, 26, who lives on the fourth floor of the Dorney Tower, is waiting outside the leisure centre after being told he will receive a call once staff have found him alternative accommodation. He says he received conflicting messages on Friday night from security guards over whether or not he could stay in his flat. ""They came knocking and advised us that we should leave but it was not forced. ""At the same time they're trying to shake responsibility. They're saying if you stay and there's an accident it's your problem, not ours. ""I'm staying in my flat until I get clear instructions about when to leave and how. I will wait around until I'm told where to go. I feel in limbo."" Cladding fire tests failed by 34 blocks Woman confronts Camden Council chief.

'I kept my daughter's body at home for three weeks',"When nine-year-old Niamh died, her mother, Gilli Davidson, knew how she wanted to say goodbye - and her local funeral director made it possible. Niamh Storey Davidson was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour - a rare kidney cancer affecting children - when she was six. For nearly three years she endured treatment, but kept relapsing. The family were told she was terminally ill. ""The thought that she wouldn't be here was unbearable,"" remembers Gilli. ""She died at home at 1:30 in the afternoon, with me and her dad."" Gilli's other children - including Niamh's twin, Zach - were at school or college. But through the blur of upset and sorrow, Gilli knew one thing clearly: she wanted to donate Niamh's eyes, the only part of the little girl unaffected by disease. Organ donation is very important to Gilli's family - as a baby, one of Niamh's brothers had a heart transplant after contracting a serious chest infection. She needed to act fast. By 5pm she was in touch with Arka Original Funerals - a Brighton company that is part of a movement in the UK to re-personalise and de-industrialise death, dying and funerals. When funeral director Cara Mair arrived with her colleague, Sarah Clarke-Kent, to pick Niamh up, there was no heavy-duty, black plastic body bag to zip her into. She was carried away on a stretcher with a pillow, cotton shroud, and a soft felt covering appliquÃ©d with large leaves. ""Removing someone from their home is such a hard thing for families to witness,"" says Cara. ""It's important to have something of beauty to wrap them in.  A person may have died, but it's still their shell, their vessel."" Listen toGiving death back to the peopleon BBC World Service Get the Heart and Soul podcast Niamh was taken quickly to Arka's premises, where her eyes were removed by a medical technician that same evening. ""Sarah stayed with Niamh while the procedure was done,"" says Gilli. ""That was a real gift, because then I knew it had been done really respectfully. ""The man operating told Sarah that Niamh's eyes were beautiful and in great condition, so they would definitely be given to someone else. I was really pleased to hear that."" The next day, Niamh was taken back home. Keeping a body at home before a funeral is rare in the UK, but it is not illegal. The most important consideration is temperature. Some funeral companies supply air conditioning units in the summer months to keep a body cool, and electric cold blankets may be used as well. But in Niamh's case, temperature was not an issue. It was November, so she was placed in a room at home with the windows open. ""She stayed there, lying on an armchair with her blankets and her cushions,"" remembers Gilli. ""I couldn't possibly have left her somewhere else. It just didn't feel right. She'd just turned nine years old - it still felt as though she was part of me."" Niamh and her twin brother Zach aged five - a year before her diagnosis Niamh would remain at home for nearly three weeks, with her eyes closed. ""We try and slow things down for loved ones, to give time to digest the news of a death.  We don't have a prescribed way of doing things,"" says Cara. In the days Niamh was at home, Gilli spent a lot of time with her. ""I was able to wash her. And dress her in her favourite things. The main thing for me was to make her death real. ""If Niamh had just disappeared out of the house, and then a coffin had arrived and I never saw her again, I'd still be searching..."" Gilli trusted her own instincts on this because - almost unbelievably - she had already experienced the loss of two other children. Her first child, Liam, died shortly after he was born in 1990. ""I remember asking to see him before the funeral, and the chaplain running the service wouldn't let me. ""So for years afterwards, I used to think if someone knocked on the door, and said, 'Oh, there's been a terrible mistake - here's your son,' I would've just accepted it. ""It was as if I didn't really believe he was dead."" It preyed on Gilli's mind that she had not had one last look at her son. ""It made me think - why? Are they trying to trick me? You're in such a strange state after the death of a child."" Cara Mair is trying to make funerals more personal In the UK, it is not common for family and friends to view a body in a casket just before burial or cremation. But Cara Mair says that for some clients this is important. ""When the coffin's closed, they know they've been the last to see that person, so they can rest assured they're undisturbed. ""It's not the same for everyone - this might freak some people out. But the choice to do it needs to be there, and the funeral profession needs to be comfortable with it."" Cara Mair and Sarah Clarke-Kent encourage bereaved families to get involved in every aspect of the funeral process. Their company features in a forthcoming documentary calledDead Good,external. In this clip, a woman has chosen to help prepare a dear friend for his funeral. This video can not be played Sarah and Cara help a woman to bathe and dress her friend for burial In 1998, Gilli lost a second child, Robbie, who was still-born. She had learned some lessons from her first bereavement but the funeral service still seemed all wrong. ""It was too wordy for a tiny baby. And the funeral director had put in a lot of religion, which had nothing to do with me,"" she says. Gilli remembered a conversation she had with Niamh before she died. ""We were walking to the park with her twin, and she said she wanted to be buried. She didn't like the idea of fire, and was adamant about that."" But Gilli hated the idea of a graveyard - dark, and foreboding, and so unlike her shy little girl. The family settled on a woodland burial. Gilli was not sure she wanted to put her daughter in a coffin, so Arka advised her that Niamh could be buried only in a shroud. But at the last minute, her father changed his mind, and Niamh was placed in a wicker coffin. ""In the time she'd been at home since she'd died, she hadn't really changed very much,"" remembers Sarah Clarke-Kent. ""She looked very peaceful and small."" Niamh loved dogs. So on the day of the funeral, her street was filled with neighbours, friends, children and their pets. ""It was very moving how they stayed involved and in control of Niamh's funeral, and it was a privilege to support them,"" says Cara Mair. She drove Niamh's coffin slowly up the street followed by a walking procession of mourners and well-wishers. The balloons were released, and then everyone got into their cars and drove to the woodland burial site. Pets were welcome at Niamh's funeral The day has stayed with Gilli. ""It really did feel right. ""The funeral's only the start of saying goodbye, but it's such an important start - it's the beginning of moving on to the next chapter of life without that person. ""And if death isn't dealt with in a good way, the bereavement gets stuck, and that can affect your life and your children's."" Gilli's family had an overwhelming response to their decision to donate Niamh's eyes. ""A lot of people got in touch with us,"" says Gilli. ""We have this cultural idea that the eyes are the windows to the soul, so it's common for organ donors to write on their cards that they don't want their eyes to be taken. ""Many people wrote to us to say they had changed their minds about that after hearing Niamh's story."" And when Gilli heard her daughter's corneas had been transplanted successfully, giving sight to a teenager and a young man, she was delighted. ""It means a little bit of Niamh has lived on - that's her legacy.""

The stories behind the scars on England's skin,"Hill figures, emblazoned like scar tissue across England's undulating landscape, hark back to times when gods were honoured and appeased by grand gestures. Although horses - and some well-endowed giants - are perhaps the most well-known hill figures there are also some more unusual creatures and carvings. A lion stands proudly in Bedfordshire. A kiwi in Wiltshire is a testament to the homesick New Zealand soldiers once stationed nearby. Here are the stories behind some of the enormous symbols which have become part of the country's very fabric. Is it a horse or a dragon? It is said that when King Arthur awakes the hill figure will rise up and dance The Uffington Horse, in the Berkshire Downs, is considered the oldest hill figure of them all. Carved in the Iron Age, there has been an unbroken chain of people caring for this prehistoric monument for the past 3,000 years. Soil tests show the horse has been there since between 1200 BC and 800 BC. There are plenty of legends associated with both the figure and with nearby Dragon Hill. There have even been suggestions the horse is in fact a dragon. One tale is that King Arthur will one day wake when England is in peril. When Arthur rouses (although legend has it he fought against the English, so it would seem unlikely), the Uffingtonhorse will rise up and dance on Dragon Hill,external. A similar creature is featured on old Celtic coins from 150 BC. In fact depictions of horses are fairly common, with at least 24 across Britain - although some can no longer be seen. Historian Dr Mark Hows, who studies hill figures, believes the figure represents the Celtic goddess Epona, protector of horses, and all the other horses are copies of - or at least inspired by - the Uffington original. However, only the Osmington White Horse - a 260ft (79m) figure which prances across the South Dorset Downs - has a rider. It was carved in 1808 in honour of King George III, who was a regular visitor to nearby Weymouth. The figure underwent something of a trial in 1989 when the BBC programme Challenge Anneka decided to restore it -but ended up damaging it,external. It was properly redone in time for the 2012 Olympics, when it could be seen by television viewers of sailing events held in Weymouth harbour. The Osmington White Horse was carved in honour of King George III Although undoubtedly ""anatomically impressive"", the giant's origins are uncertain One of the most famous hill figures is the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, which Historic England describes as ""bold and anatomically impressive"". The 180ft-tall (55m) turf-cut figure of a naked man waving a club has prompted considerable debate over its origins. Early antiquarians linked him with the Anglo-Saxon deity Helis, while others believe he is the classical hero Hercules. Still others posit he was carved during the English Civil War as a parody of Oliver Cromwell, although he is commonly believed to have some association with a pagan fertility cult. A further layer of mystery was added in the 1980s when a survey revealed anomalies which suggested he originally wore a cloak and was stood over a disembodied head. There has also been a suggestion his significant anatomy is in fact the result of merging a smaller penis with a representation of his navel during a re-cut by the Victorians. The giant has caused a few hot flushes in the past. Prudish politicians led to a version on a brewer's logohaving his modesty preservedin a Houses of Parliament bar by the addition of a paper fig leaf. And keeping with a political theme, pranksters recently attachedgiant letters spelling out ""Theresa"". A photocopied fig leaf was added to the beer pump clip in a Houses of Parliament bar Cerne Abbas is not the only place to boast a giant on its hillside. Wilmington in East Sussex has its own ""Long Man"" - but he is a more modest sort than his Dorset cousin. For many years up until the 19th Century, the Long Man was only visible when the sun was in a certain position, but since 1874 its shape has been marked out in yellow bricks. The Sussex Archaeological Society describes him as ""the mysterious guardian of the South Downs"" and says there are many theories about his origin. Some are convinced he is prehistoric, others believe he is the work of an artistic monk from the nearby priory, which would date him from between the 11th and 15th Centuries. Roman coins bearing a similar figure suggest he belonged to the 4th Century and there may be plausible parallels with a helmeted figure found on Anglo-Saxon ornaments. We may never know. The Bulford kiwi photographed in 2013, following restoration and maintenance by a local scout group In 1919, following the end of World War One, officers commanding restless and homesick New Zealand troops wanted a task to distract their men and keep them out of trouble. Perhaps inspired by Wiltshire's large number of chalk hill figures - it has 13 horse figures alone - they despatched the soldiers to carve a kiwi in the hillside above Bulford Military Camp. It was designed by Sgt Maj Percy Cecil Blenkarne from a sketch of a stuffed kiwi specimen in the British Museum. The figure, the body of which measures 1.5 acres (6,100 m sq), was completed shortly before the troops went home. It was then looked after by the Kiwi shoe polish company as an advert, until it was covered during World War Two in case it was used as a landmark by enemy aircraft. Although the carving was neglected and nearly disappeared in the 1970s, it was restored close to its former glory in 1986 by a local scout group - which changed its name to the 1st Bulford (Kiwi) Scouts. It has now beengiven protected status. A postcard from about 1919 shows the kiwi shortly after completion Other remnants of military life can be found on Fovant Down, between Salisbury and Shaftesbury, where military insignia are carved. Five of the Fovant Badges were created by soldiers during World War One, including the rising sun of the Australian and Commonwealth Military Forces, the Post Office Rifles and the Devonshire Regiment. The ACMF also had men stationed at the nearby Hurdcott army camp, where they cut a map of Australia. The badges belonging to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and the Wiltshire Regiment were built in the early 1950s by the Fovant Home Guard, while the Royal Corps of Signals cut their badge in 1970 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the corps. The YMCA emblem, which is not a regimental badge, was allowed to fade away in 2005 and can no longer be seen But to find the largest of England's hill figures, one has to travel to Bedfordshire. The giant 147m (483 ft) long lion was carved in 1933 to indicate the location of Whipsnade wildlife park. Thousands of man hours over 18 months were spent digging the creature out of the hillside with pick-axes. However, the outbreak of World War Two resulted in it being covered up again, amid fears it could help guide German bombers to the nearby towns of Luton and Dunstable. Troops were brought in to help camouflage the landmark with brushwood, nets and manure. After the war the lion was uncovered and spruced up again in 2005. He is now visible for several miles across the Dunstable Downs. Moustache added to chalk hill giant White horses lit up by lanterns.

Navigating your Eid family gathering,"The holy Islamic fasting month of Ramadan is coming to an end this weekend. For many Muslims around the world, it's the one time of the year that they return to their hometowns and gather with their extended family for a catch-up and feast. But as Christine Franciska of the BBC's Indonesian Service explains, for many young people, Eid al-Fitr's family gatherings are not as pleasant as they seem. It's the time when aunties, uncles, and older relatives who you rarely see ask you ""scary questions"". ""Who's your boyfriend (or girlfriend) now?"" ""When are you getting married?"" ""Why are you looking a bit...fat?"" ""It is not comfortable at all,"" said Indonesian Mochamad Fadly Anwar on Facebook. ""And I think it crosses the line. I am like, hey mind your own business."" ""Those questions are legendary..."" said another user. One way of handling the awkwardness? Indonesian psychologist Roslina Verauli says these questions are part and parcel of collective cultures, and a way for older relatives to get close to you. ""Don't immediately think that they're pressuring you. If you have an awareness of our culture, you won't get easily offended,"" she says. ""We need to get together and feel close to each other. That is why we ask each other those very personal questions because we feel close to each other even though you may not have seen those relatives in 20 years, or only meet them once a year."" But this doesn't mean those questions are appropriate, she says - it can still be unpleasant discussing personal matters with people you rarely meet. So here are guidelines from the experts on how to avoid offending one of your relatives at this year's family gatherings. ""How's the food?"" ""Your new outfit looks fabulous!"" These are clichÃ©s, but are very useful phrases in awkward situations when you don't know much about your relative's life. ""Don't ask for details first. Ask their opinions on things,"" says Mrs Verauli. ""This is a bridge to move to more personal questions. If you want to get close to a relative, have your clichÃ© questions ready for the family gathering."" Remember who you are talking to. You should ask different questions to relatives in different age groups. When chatting with children, Mrs Verauli explains, ask them about their activities and hobbies. ""Don't ask 'did you win that competition last month?'. It will hurt them, because for elementary school children, questions about achievement and if they're doing well at school are sensitive questions."" How about teenagers? ""Don't ask 'do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend'. They are sure to be very shy answering that even if they have one,"" says Mrs Verauli. ""Whether they are dating and if they are popular with their peers are important matters for teenagers and is a sensitive issue best avoided."" For young adults, marriage questions are a no-no, as are questions about jobs and wages especially for those who feel they haven't met the expectations of their family or culture. ""In an early adulthood (20-30 year olds) starting a career and having a spouse are some of the expected things they should have achieved by that age. If you ask them directly about this, it could hurt them."" But asking about the career of your relatives in their 30s and 40s is a good one, because at that stage, usually, their career is more stable, she adds. As for your elderly relatives, start by talking about positive things such as their health and their ""youthful"" appearance. Talking about sickness makes them sad, points out Mrs Verauli. How to answer? So what if you get questions like the dreaded ""are you getting married?"" Psychologist Pingkan Rumondor from Bina Nusantara University says the best way to respond is to smile and tell the truth. ""Answer it as comfortably as you can. If you feel like it's too personal, just simply smile and say I don't know, and try to get away."" ""There is no obligation to answer.""

How many are affected by May's offer to EU citizens?,"Theresa May told other EU leaders on Thursday that a new ""UK settled status"" would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years, rights to stay and access to health, education and other benefits. She said the proposals depend on other EU states guaranteeing UK citizens the same rights. So, how many EU nationals live in the UK and where do they come from? And which of the other 27 EU countries host most UK citizens? The number of citizens of the other 27 EU countries living in the UK in 2015 wasestimated by the Office of National Statistics,external(ONS) to be around 3.2 million. Polish citizens topped the list with 916,000 - more than any other nationality. In 2001, there were only 38,000 Polish nationals living in the UK. Irish nationals are the second largest EU group in the UK, estimated at 332,000 in 2015. In 2001, there were only 5,000 Romanians living in the UK. Romania joined the EU in 2007, but its citizens were not allowed to seek employment in the UK freely until 2014. There are now 233,000 Romanians living in the UK, making them the third biggest EU group of migrants. There has been a notable increase in the number of migrants from the older EU member states too: Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. Ananalysis by the ONS,external, published in January 2017, suggests that an estimated 900,000 UK citizens are long-term residents of other EU countries. Spain hosted the highest number of migrants from the UK with 309,000. More than 100,000 of them are aged 65 and over. France was second with 157,062, and Ireland third with 112,090. These numbers are all estimates, generally based on extrapolations of countries' censuses, which are carried out every 10 years. An earlierestimate by the UN,externalput the figure of UK nationals in the EU slightly higher, at 1.2 million. Welooked at their breakdownlast year.

Turkey excludes evolution from textbooks prompting debate,"Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution is set to be expunged from textbooks used by 14 and 15 year olds in Turkey ""This is bigotry, this is all about being a fanatic. How are they going to teach biology now? How are they going to talk about science?"" On an online forum about the government's decision to exclude the theory of evolution from the national curriculum, a passionate discussion is under way. ""Evolutionary theory is one of the most powerful and fundamental theories in modern science. To describe it as 'controversial' is unbelievable,"" says one commenter. Another argues that the theory was not well taught anyhow: ""Once the teacher asked us who believed in evolutionary theory. I raised my hand. The teacher said: 'Are you a monkey then?'"" But on Facebook another commenter says: ""I want to thank the government for preventing our youth to be poisoned by this rotten and absurd theory. There is nothing more natural than excluding it from the national curriculum."" Turkey's pugnacious president Religion and Ethics: Perspectives: Evolution v Creationism in modern-day faith On Wednesday, the head of the education ministry's curriculum board Alpaslan DurmuÅ announced that a section on Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution would be excluded from biology textbooks in the ninth grade (14 and 15 year olds) from next year on. Students are ""too young to understand 'controversial subjects'"", he said, adding that the topic will be delayed until undergraduate study. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already approved the proposed changes to the national curriculum, which are expected to be published next week after the Muslim Eid ending the fasting month of Ramadan. President Erdogan is accused of trying to steer Turkey away from the secular tradition of its founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ""Turkey will be the second country after Saudi Arabia that excludes theory of evolution from its curriculum,"" says Feray Aytekin Aydogan, the head of Egitim-Sen - a teachers' union representing over 100,000 members across the country. ""Even in Iran, there are 60 hours of lessons on evolution and 11 hours on Darwin himself,"" she adds. The debate on the exclusion of the theory of evolution started early this year, when the draft curriculum for primary and secondary schools was announced. Other changes include a decrease in the amount of time allocated to the life of Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The changes reportedly were proposed by a conservative teachers union close to the government and the government argues all amendments were publicly discussed and consulted upon. The secular opposition in Turkey says that Mr Erdogan and the governing party are trying to move the country away from its founding values, and make the society more Islamic and conservative. Mr Erdogan has already stated several times his goal of raising pious generations and Deputy PM Numan Kurtulmus had once described the theory of evolution as archaic. Why does Charles Darwin eclipse Alfred Russel Wallace? #BBCtrending: The man who says he can 'destroy' evolution Islam acknowledges that God is the creator of everything, Adam was the first man created from clay and Eve was created from his ribs. The theory of evolution is not accepted in religious circles. ""Not only biology, but all classes are to be taught in a more religious context. This new curriculum is to produce very harmful results for our students and the future of this country,"" argues Feray Aytekin Aydogan. ""Turkey is being redesigned. That is the danger. Our teachers will be protesting out on the street and in the classrooms, they will carry on educating the students according to secular and scientific values no matter what the government does,"" she says.

Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy,"This video can not be played Richard Sabin: ""We actively use this data for marine conservation purposes now"" It's a curious thing to see a group of early whale foetuses up close - to see beings so small that have the potential to become so big. But what really strikes you, especially in those initial developmental stages, is how familiar the forms look. How like an early human foetus, they appear. ""This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals,"" says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum's top whale expert. ""You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it's really not until you're halfway through the gestation - which  for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is."" Whales reached huge size only recently In search of the real Moby Dick What orcas teach us about the menopause Lost whaling station at the end of the world Humpbacks are recognisable for their long pectoral flippers Richard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he's going to put on display forthe NHM's major summer exhibition on cetaceans,external. They go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that's perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature. This larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles. The specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarcticto gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets. Their role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It's an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks. Data collected during the whaling years made the case for a moratorium unarguable Somehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry. ""There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge,"" says Richard. ""The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now."" Just this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling datato show how species had shrunk in sizein the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups. Foetuses and other specimens were brought back to the UK from whale processing factories Sperm whale jaw: There was a time when all whales had teeth. Baleen were a later innovation What have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology. ""One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They're then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop,"" explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks' prey. ""So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we've only just found the fossils that back that up."" The famous ""Thames whale"", which stranded and died in 2006, will be exhibited The whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance.The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus (""Dippy"") dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I've had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular). So, it's certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth. More than 100 specimens from the London museum's collections are being set up in the institution's Waterhouse Gallery. The exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today. And it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres. ""We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us,"" says Richard. ""This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens.""

Missing priest found dead on beach,"Father Vazhachira was last seen near St John Church A priest who went missing from a church in Edinburgh last week has been found dead on a beach in East Lothian. Father Martin Xavier Vazhachira was last seen at St John The Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Corstorphine, at about 13:00 on Tuesday. Police and the Catholic church said his body was found on the beach at Dunbar on Friday afternoon. Father Xavier, 33, was originally from India. The cause of death has yet to be established. The Bishop of Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh, Leo Cushley, said:  ""The news of Father Martin Xavier's death comes as a great shock and a great sadness to all those who knew him and loved him. ""Our thoughts and, more importantly, our prayers are with him and with all his loved ones in both Scotland and India. May he rest in peace."" Father Vazhachira was a native of Kerala in southern India and was ordained a priest in 2013. He arrived in Scotland in 2016 in order to undertake post-graduate studies at Edinburgh University. He also served in local Catholic parishes, initially in Falkirk before being appointed to Corstorphine in October 2016. He was last seen on Tuesday afternoon in his parish house. The alarm was raised by parishioners after he failed to turn up for Holy Mass on Wednesday morning. His family in India have been informed of his death and a post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the cause.

Martha crowned the world's ugliest dog,"Three-year-old Martha with owner Shirley Zindler Martha, a Neapolitan mastiff, has been named this year's World's Ugliest Dog. The annual competition, now it its 29th year, was held in Petaluma, California. Martha, with owner Shirley Zindler, beat 13 other contenders to be presented with a trophy and a $1,500 (Â£1,200) prize. The big-jowled crowd-pleaser will now be flown to New York for ""media appearances"", according to the organisers. TheSonoma-Marin Fair,external, where the event takes place, says the event typically includes lots of dogs that have been rescued from shelters and puppy mills.

Qatar rejects demands from Arab states,"Qatar, which is rich in natural gas, is home to 2.7 million people Qatar's foreign minister has rejected a list of 13 conditions set by four Arab states for lifting sanctions, saying it is neither reasonable nor actionable. Qatar is under strict sanctions from Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism. Among other things, they have demanded the closure of Al Jazeera TV, which is funded by the Qatari government. The UAE's foreign minister has suggested they may cut ties completely. But Anwar Gargash added that the countries were not seeking to overthrow the Qatari leadership, the Associated Press news agency reports. Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for more than two weeks, with Iran and Turkey increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. It denies accusations that it is funding terrorism and fostering regional instability. The four countries also want Qatar to reduce its ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base,setting a deadline on Friday of 10 days. Qatar crisis deepens as Gulf allies dig in Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims Five surprising facts about Qatar The government is reviewing the demands, a spokesman has said. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, quoted by Al-Jazeera, said: ""The US secretary of state recently called upon the blockading nations to produce a list of grievances that was 'reasonable and actionable'. ""The British foreign secretary asked that the demands be 'measured and realistic.' This list does not satisfy that [sic] criteria."" This video can not be played Giles Trendle of Al Jazeera speaking in June: ""We're not partisan to any particular group or ideology"" He said the demands were proof that the sanctions had ""nothing to do with combating terrorism...

Al Jazeera accused them of trying to silence freedom of expression, adding: ""We assert our right to practise our journalism professionally without bowing to pressure from any government or authority."" Qatar's main import routes - by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from container ships docked in the UAE - have been disrupted, and much of the surrounding airspace has been closed to its air traffic. However, the small but wealthy country has so far avoided economic collapse by finding alternative routes. Qatari citizens living in neighbouring countries or with family living there have been hit harder, Reuters news agency notes, because of ultimatums issued for them to leave. The UAE's foreign minister said there would be a ""parting of ways"" with Qatar if it failed to meet them. ""The alternative is not escalation,"" he said. ""The alternative is parting of ways. It's very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping with one of the partners... actively promoting what is an extremist and terrorist agenda."" He described Qatar as a ""Trojan horse"" within the group of Arab monarchies. Correspondents say there has been frustration in Washington over the time taken by the Saudis and others to formalise their demands.

Commons plaque for murdered MP Jo Cox,"Jo Cox's widower Brendan and two children with the new plaque A coat of arms to honour murdered MP Jo Cox has been unveiled in Parliament by her two children. The memorial plaque featuring a coat of arms designed by Cuillin, six, and Lejla, four, was installed in the Commons chamber. It was part of a ""family day"" as MPs and staff were encouraged to bring their children into the chamber. Mrs Cox, 41,was shot and stabbedin Birstall, West Yorkshire, part of her Batley and Spen constituency. The crime happened little over a year ago, on 16 June 2016. The design of the plaque was inspired by Mrs Cox's maiden speech. It contained the line, ""we are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us"". The plaque bears the motto More in Common and has elements to show Jo Cox's love of rivers and mountains, and her support for women The four roses represent her family members - two red for the Labour Party and two white for the county of Yorkshire. Mrs Cox was killed as she arrived at a constituency surgery in June 2016 MPs killed while in office are remembered by heraldic shields in the Commons. They Include Conservative MP Ian Gow, killed by an IRA car bomb in 1990; and Tory shadow Northern Ireland secretary Airey Neave, who died in a car bomb attack in Westminster in 1979.

Cladding fire tests failed by 27 blocks,"This video can not be played Watch: Camden resident confronts council chief Cladding on 34 tower blocks in 17 council areas in England has failed fire safety tests, the government says. So far, every sample has failed the tests. The government plans to examine cladding from up to 600 blocks. The updated figures came as people from the Chalcots Estate in Swiss Cottage, north London, spent a second night away from their homes. But - across the country - not every block that fails safety tests will be evacuated. Four of the five blocks on the Chalcots Estate were evacuated on Friday because of fears over cladding, gas pipes, and fire doors. Camden Council said it had no option but to move residents from 650 flats while work takes place. Council leader Georgia Gould said staff would continue asking those who had not yet left to vacate their flats. ""By remaining in the blocks these residents risk delaying the work that is required and that we are undertaking to make these homes safe. ""It is not safe to remain in these blocks and our residents' safety will continue to be the council's number one priority."" Almost 200 offers of accommodation have been made to displaced residents, and most of these have been taken up. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid - while agreeing with the decision in Camden - said: ""A failure in testing of the cladding does not necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated. ""The decision by Camden council was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures."" This video can not be played Watch: Meet Rosie, who refused to leave Taplow Tower in Camden Plymouth is one of the affected areas. The elected leader of the city council, Ian Bowyer, said: ""We are not proposing to evacuate... ""The failures that have been attributed to the blocks in Camden are not present here in the three tower blocks in Plymouth."" The Local Government Association said some councils have introduced 24-hour warden patrols to mitigate the risk before cladding is removed. The Department for Communities and Local Government's testing programme, which began on Wednesday, is able to test 100 samples a day. If needed, further lab capability could be provided. Mr Javid said testing was taking place ""around the clock"". Although every sample has failed the test so far, he pointed out that local authorities have been asked to prioritise buildings they had most concern over. Seven of the 17 local authorities where high-rise buildings have failed fire safety tests have been named. They are: Camden - where residents have been evacuated from four blocks on the Chalcots Estate Brent - where a housing association tower block, Elizabeth House, has cladding but London Fire Brigade advises it is not a risk Barnet - where cladding put up on three towers in Granville Road, NW2, in 2012 is to be removed as precautionary measure Hounslow - where Clements Court tower in Cranford is to have outer cladding removed Manchester - where 78 panels are being removed from one area of theVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe Salford - where cladding is also to be removed from nine tower blocks Plymouth - where three blocks on theMount Wise Tower estatewere found to have cladding made from similar material to Grenfell Tower Portsmouth - where the city council is removing cladding fromHoratia House and Leamington House in Somerstown The Chalcots Estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79 people. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. One flat destroyed in London fire Confusion and anger after evacuation Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer After the evacuation, emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. Camden Council - which said it already spent Â£500,000 on hotel rooms - said it would reimburse residents who have paid for their own temporary accommodation. It has also set aside Â£100,000 for food and essential items for displaced residents. Fire crews have been put on watch at the Chalcots estate The work at Chalcots is expected to take three to four weeks. Sayed Mead, a resident on the estate who left his flat, told BBC Breakfast that not knowing where he was going to be housed had been ""eating me away"". He was eventually told at midnight on Saturday where he and his mother can stay, and said it felt like ""I'm going to start my life all over again"". He also said the council had created ""panic"" among the residents. Despite being urged to leave, around 20 households had refused to vacate their homes by Saturday evening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said councils across the country needed to deal ""swiftly and effectively with the scale of the fire safety challenge"" posed by the Grenfell Tower fire. ""This is now a nationwide threat and the prime minister needs to get a grip,"" he added. Do you live in one of the tower blocks that have failed fire cladding safety tests?

Schwarzenegger and Macron swipe at Trump,"This video can not be played Schwarzenegger backs Macron in Trump fight French President Emmanuel Macron has taken another swipe at Donald Trump over the US president's policy on climate change - this time backed up by the muscle of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In a video on social media, Mr Macron is joined by the Terminator star as he vows to ""make the planet great again"". ""Make America great again"" was Mr Trump's presidential campaign slogan. Mr Macron has been critical of the US president's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Could this latest development,exposed in a post on Twitter,externalon Friday, be the start of a new ""political bromance""? Speaking into his phone camera, Mr Schwarzenegger said that he and Mr Macron had been ""talking about environmental issues and a green future"" together. The footage was posted on the social media site with the former film star and California governor saying he was ""truly honoured"" to meet Mr Macron, adding that the pair would ""work together for a clean energy future"". The 10-second clip runs for the full duration with the caption: ""With President Macron, a great leader!"" Watch: Macron pledges to 'make planet great again' Trump climate deal pullout: Global reaction What can Trump learn from wrestler and action hero? In April, Mr Schwarzenegger received France's Legion of Honour in recognition of his environmental work. He said that he felt ""very honoured"" and that ""we have created the mess and now we have to get rid of the mess... it doesn't matter who is president"". When Mr Trump announced earlier this month that the US was withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Mr Macron said in a statement that the decision was ""a mistake for the US and for our planet"". ""I tell you firmly tonight: We will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way. Don't be mistaken on climate; there is no plan B because there is no planet B,"" he said. The Paris climate agreement was established to limit the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, with countries committed to keeping the rise in global temperatures ""well below"" 2C.

Passions flare as Turkey excludes evolution from textbooks,"Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution is set to be expunged from textbooks used by 14 and 15 year olds in Turkey ""This is bigotry, this is all about being a fanatic. How are they going to teach biology now? How are they going to talk about science?"" On an online forum about the government's decision to exclude the theory of evolution from the national curriculum, a passionate discussion is under way. ""Evolutionary theory is one of the most powerful and fundamental theories in modern science. To describe it as 'controversial' is unbelievable,"" says one commenter. Another argues that the theory was not well taught anyhow: ""Once the teacher asked us who believed in evolutionary theory. I raised my hand. The teacher said: 'Are you a monkey then?'"" But on Facebook another commenter says: ""I want to thank the government for preventing our youth to be poisoned by this rotten and absurd theory. There is nothing more natural than excluding it from the national curriculum."" Turkey's pugnacious president Religion and Ethics: Perspectives: Evolution v Creationism in modern-day faith On Wednesday, the head of the education ministry's curriculum board Alpaslan DurmuÅ announced that a section on Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution would be excluded from biology textbooks in the ninth grade (14 and 15 year olds) from next year on. Students are ""too young to understand 'controversial subjects'"", he said, adding that the topic will be delayed until undergraduate study. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already approved the proposed changes to the national curriculum, which are expected to be published next week after the Muslim Eid ending the fasting month of Ramadan. President Erdogan is accused of trying to steer Turkey away from the secular tradition of its founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ""Turkey will be the second country after Saudi Arabia that excludes theory of evolution from its curriculum,"" says Feray Aytekin Aydogan, the head of Egitim-Sen - a teachers' union representing over 100,000 members across the country. ""Even in Iran, there are 60 hours of lessons on evolution and 11 hours on Darwin himself,"" she adds. The debate on the exclusion of the theory of evolution started early this year, when the draft curriculum for primary and secondary schools was announced. Other changes include a decrease in the amount of time allocated to the life of Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The changes reportedly were proposed by a conservative teachers union close to the government and the government argues all amendments were publicly discussed and consulted upon. The secular opposition in Turkey says that Mr Erdogan and the governing party are trying to move the country away from its founding values, and make the society more Islamic and conservative. Mr Erdogan has already stated several times his goal of raising pious generations and Deputy PM Numan Kurtulmus had once described the theory of evolution as archaic. Why does Charles Darwin eclipse Alfred Russel Wallace? #BBCtrending: The man who says he can 'destroy' evolution Islam acknowledges that God is the creator of everything, Adam was the first man created from clay and Eve was created from his ribs. The theory of evolution is not accepted in religious circles. ""Not only biology, but all classes are to be taught in a more religious context. This new curriculum is to produce very harmful results for our students and the future of this country,"" argues Feray Aytekin Aydogan. ""Turkey is being redesigned. That is the danger. Our teachers will be protesting out on the street and in the classrooms, they will carry on educating the students according to secular and scientific values no matter what the government does,"" she says.

Armed Forces Day events across country,"The Red Arrows flying over Liverpool was one of the highlights The UK's annual Armed Forces Day is taking place, with more than 300 events across the country. The national event in Liverpool, attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and Prince Edward, saw a Red Arrows flypast and a parade to the waterfront. Mrs May said that armed forces are more relevant than ever, ""playing a vital role"" after the Manchester attack. The day was billed,externalas a chance for people to show their support for those connected with the armed forces. As well as those currently serving, the event honours veterans, reservists, cadets, families and charities. Theresa May attended the event in Liverpool and paid tribute to the armed forces Parades, military displays, gun salutes and Typhoon and Red Arrows flypasts have been some of the highlights. The Royal Navy's type-23 frigate HMS Iron Duke was docked in Liverpool for the celebrations. A series of displays along Pier head also took place featuring planes, helicopters, tanks and marching bands. Armed forces day in pictures Mrs May praised the ""tremendous job that the armed forces do for us here at home and across the world, helping to keep us safe"". She said that armed forces ""provided visible reassurance to our communities"" when they were deployed on the streets after the UK terror threat level was raised to critical. Troops were deployed after 22 people were killed by suicide bomber Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena on 22 May. Military parades have been taking place across the country Former service personnel from Legion Scotland marched down the Royal Mile in Edinburgh The parade in Liverpool comprised about 100 personnel from each of the services, plus bands, veterans and about 300 cadets. Scotland has also paid tribute with parades held in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. There are events across Wales, including ones in Swansea and Wrexham. Northern Ireland has marked the daywith a military parade through Bangor, County Down. Veterans and cadets also joined soldiers, sailors and marines as Liverpool led the day's events Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said there are some 10,000 service men and women who are working around the globe on operations or in British bases. ""They've been helping to deal with terrorism, they've been helping to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, they've been on Nato deployments, they've been peacekeeping in South Sudan. ""All of that keeps us safer here at home. They're out of our sight but they should never be out of mind,"" he said.

Parliament 'hit by cyber-attack',"Parliament has been hit by a cyber attack, officials at Westminster say. The ""sustained"" hack began on Friday night, prompting officials to disable remote access to the emails of MPs, peers and their staff as a safeguard. The parliamentary authorities said hackers had mounted a ""determined attack"" on all user accounts ""in an attempt to identify weak passwords"". Government sources say it appeared the attack has been contained but it will ""remain vigilant"". A parliamentary spokeswoman said they were investigating the attack and liaising with the National Cyber Security Centre. She said: ""We have discovered unauthorised attempts to access accounts of parliamentary networks users... ""Parliament has robust measures in place to protect all of our accounts and systems, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect and secure our network. ""As a precaution we have temporarily restricted remote access to the network."" IT services on the parliamentary estate are working normally and a message sent to MPs urges them to be ""extra vigilant"". But a number of MPs have confirmed to the BBC they are not able to access their parliamentary email accounts outside of the Westminster estate. It comes just over a month after48 of England's NHS trusts were hit by a cyber-attack. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said: ""We have seen reports in the last few days of even Cabinet ministers' passwords being for sale online. ""We know that our public services are attacked so it is not at all surprising that there should be an attempt to hack into parliamentary emails. ""And it's a warning to everybody, whether they are in Parliament or elsewhere, that they need to do everything possible to maintain their own cyber security."" The latest attack was publicly revealed by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennardon Twitter,externalas he asked his followers to send any ""urgent messages"" to him by text. Henry Smith, Tory MP for Crawley, latertweeted:,external""Sorry no parliamentary email access today - we're under cyber attack from Kim Jong Un, (Vladimir) Putin or a kid in his mom's basement or something..."" The government's National Security Strategy said in 2015 that the threat from cyber-attacks from both organised crime and foreign intelligence agencies was one of the ""most significant risks to UK interests"". The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, started its operations in October last year. The National Crime Agency said it was working with the NCSC but the centre was ""leading the operational response"".

Dizzee: 'I should headline Glastonbury',"This video can not be played Dizzee Rascal Dizzee Rascal says he deserves to be given top billing at the Glastonbury Festival. ""I've toured this festival for years, never disappointed,"" he told the BBC. ""You can always count on me. ""I'm basically at the stage where they need to make me headline this thing - because they ain't had no British rappers headline this festival."" As if to prove his point, the star drew huge crowds to his set on The West Holts stage on Friday. Running through hits including Fix U, Look Sharp, Bonkers and new single Space, he provided a raucous counterpart to Radiohead's more cerebral set on the Pyramid Stage. Radiohead mesmerise fans at Glastonbury BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen Bradley Cooper surprises Glastonbury fans True keepers of the Glastonbury spirit? The police! Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Dizzee's appearance put him at the top of the bill on the festival's third-biggest stage, and grime collective Boy Better Know will headline the second-biggest Other Stage on Sunday. But the star asked why US rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West had been made main stage headliners ahead of their British counterparts. ""I've been on the main stage, but I need to headline the whole ting,"" he said. ""I've got 15 years of bangers. I'm confident I would tear it up."" However, he was careful not to be critical of Glastonbury, where he has delivered crowd-pleasing sets for more than a decade. ""It's the biggest festival you could do,"" he said.

Women's cricket makes declaration of intent,"The teams have been playing warm up matches, including one between England and Sri Lanka The Women's Cricket World Cup takes to fieldsacross England this weekend,looking to bowl over youngsters and women, not to mention businesses, with their event. As well as seeking to encourage more girls and boys to take up the sport, organisers also want more females to follow cricket, while convincing young sportswomen there is a worthwhile career for them in the game. Ironically, for what is the most financially lucrative Women's World Cup to date, making huge amounts of money from the event is not the main priority. Holders Australia will be chasing a record seventh title And there is a lot of cash around the eight-team tournament -with record prize money of $2m (Â£1.57m),,externalhealthy ticket sales, and big-name International Cricket Council (ICC) global sponsors such as Nissan, Emirates, Hublot and Moneygram backing the event. Rather, it is hoped that the money being spent now onthe 28-day, 31-match, tournament,,externalwill be a catalyst that piques the interest of potential commercial sponsors in both the UK and elsewhere. ""What strikes me is that we have been presented with this huge potential for growth in so many areas, sporting and financial,"" Clare Connor, head of England Women's Cricketand a former national team captain,,externaltells me. ""We have got a sport, cricket, that is looking for relevance. People are asking 'how can we help take cricket into a new era?' Clare Connor holds a number of high profile roles in women's cricket ""One way is to engage with young women and girls. We have to maximise these opportunities during the World Cup."" Ms Connor, who is also chair of the women's committee at cricket's governing body the ICC, said that irrespective of who wins, the World Cup offers a chance to grow the sport in lots of creative ways. One way is through theECB's All Stars Cricket,,externalaimed at providing children aged five to eight with a memorable first experience of the sport. The nationwide entry-level participation programme aims to get 50,000 girls and boys - and their families - excited by the game over the summer. ""We also have a soft ball initiative specifically for women."" says Ms Connor, with a number of festivals being held during the World Cup. The All Stars programme is aimed at young girls and boys As well as boosting participation, getting more women to follow women's cricket is a major goal. ""At the moment it is a fallacy to think women watch women's cricket. More males than females are cricket fans,"" the 40-year-old says. ""Cricket is not currently as relevant to women as it is to men, but the World Cup gives us an opportunity to change that."" She said that the majority of tickets, some 80%, had been sold to fans of England Cricket, and that she expected a high majority of them to be to men. ""But work by our marketing team does show there is a growing interest in watching by women,"" she adds. ""That is why a lot of our marketing of the All Stars children's programme is targeted at mums, we are looking to engage them in the whole experience."" She said a new city-based eight-team Twenty20 tournament,due to start in 2020,was the ideal way to attract a new female audience. Half of the fans at the Women's Big Bash in Australia are females ""We have been looking at Australia and the Women's Big Bash, where 50% of spectators are women. They have totally altered the make-up of their audience, and that is something we would look to emulate."" The tournament was brought forward so more matches sat in school term time. Just less than half of the matches are taking place on weekdays which presents an opportunity for local schools to witness tournament action live. Meanwhile, Ms Connor says tickets for World Cup games have beenpriced to allow an affordable family day out.,externalEngland's opening game against India is sold out, and 15,000 tickets have been sold for the final at Lord's. England cricket player Anya Shrubsole on forging a cricket career The 25-year-old is the daughter of Ian Shrubsole, a former Minor Counties cricketer in the 1990s. At 13 she was the first girl to join the Somerset Academy. ""I remember from the age of three or four my dad playing, and going out onto the pitch at the interval, throwing a ball around. That is my first memory of cricket. I then really got into it when I was at school. ""Back then, when I was growing up and coming through as a player there was an element of financial reward, but not enough to live off it. The money you received wasn't enough, you couldn't have afforded a mortgage. ""However, that wasn't something that was a real issue for me, I wanted to be as good as I could be. ""But I graduated at the same time that cricket turned professional. So I have never had the worry of trying to find a job alongside playing cricket. ""In means that in terms of staying in cricket, it is now a viable career option for young women whereas previously it wasn't. You make a living out of women's cricket, like you can with women's football. Before that you would have needed a separate job alongside. ""It is an immense honour to represent your country, One of the strengths of women's sport is that they are playing for the real love of the game. ""I think we are role models for youngsters.  I am guilty sometimes of not thinking that I am, but anyone who plays international sport is a role model. ""The game is still in quite a developmental stage, and I am hopeful we will have a young audience growing up alongside the sport."" On ticket pricing, the ICC worked with a specialist agency to look at various ticket prices both at the venues (so including men's and women's cricket domestic and international), cricket as a whole, and also looked at other women's sports events in this country. ""We are not going to make a great deal of money out of it,"" says Ms Connor. Clare Connor represented England from 1995 until retiring from international cricket in 2006 But she adds: ""We are hoping that eventually the event becomes a commercial money spinner. ""For example, we hope that companies see there is an opportunity there to get involved in women's cricket, like Kia did a few years ago, when they became the official car of the England women's team. ""They saw the women's game as a real area of growth. As a challenger brand they were keen to work with women's cricket which they saw as a challenger sport."" Other positives for the women's game arethe widespread media coveragebeing given to the World Cup. In addition to the scheduled 10 fixtures to be broadcast live on TV, the remaining 21 World Cup matches will be streamed live. There will be radio commentary and video highlights on BBC radio and sport website. Meanwhile, the ICC has committed toequal prize money for women and men's cricket by 2032. ""There will be a strategic plan to ensure that the game can deliver equal prize money in 15 years time,"" says Ms Connor. ""The women's game has only been under the ICC's auspices since 2005. If you think of the developments since then, it is a sport transformed. The World Cup will continue that transformation.""

Qatar says demands not realistic,"Qatar, which is rich in natural gas, is home to 2.7 million people Qatar's foreign minister has rejected a list of 13 conditions set by four Arab states for lifting sanctions, saying it is neither reasonable nor actionable. Qatar is under strict sanctions from Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism. Among other things, they have demanded the closure of Al Jazeera TV, which is funded by the Qatari government. The UAE's foreign minister has suggested they may cut ties completely. But Anwar Gargash added that the countries were not seeking to overthrow the Qatari leadership, the Associated Press news agency reports. Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for more than two weeks, with Iran and Turkey increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. It denies accusations that it is funding terrorism and fostering regional instability. The four countries also want Qatar to reduce its ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base,setting a deadline on Friday of 10 days. Qatar crisis deepens as Gulf allies dig in Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims Five surprising facts about Qatar The government is reviewing the demands, a spokesman has said. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, quoted by Al-Jazeera, said: ""The US secretary of state recently called upon the blockading nations to produce a list of grievances that was 'reasonable and actionable'. ""The British foreign secretary asked that the demands be 'measured and realistic.' This list does not satisfy that [sic] criteria."" This video can not be played Giles Trendle of Al Jazeera speaking in June: ""We're not partisan to any particular group or ideology"" He said the demands were proof that the sanctions had ""nothing to do with combating terrorism... [but] limiting Qatar's sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy"". Al Jazeera accused them of trying to silence freedom of expression, adding: ""We assert our right to practise our journalism professionally without bowing to pressure from any government or authority."" Qatar's main import routes - by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from container ships docked in the UAE - have been disrupted, and much of the surrounding airspace has been closed to its air traffic. However, the small but wealthy country has so far avoided economic collapse by finding alternative routes. Qatari citizens living in neighbouring countries or with family living there have been hit harder, Reuters news agency notes, because of ultimatums issued for them to leave. The UAE's foreign minister said there would be a ""parting of ways"" with Qatar if it failed to meet them. ""The alternative is not escalation,"" he said. ""The alternative is parting of ways. It's very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping with one of the partners... actively promoting what is an extremist and terrorist agenda."" He described Qatar as a ""Trojan horse"" within the group of Arab monarchies. Correspondents say there has been frustration in Washington over the time taken by the Saudis and others to formalise their demands. This video can not be played The disruption could have an impact on Qatar if the dispute drags on US President Donald Trump has taken a hard line towards Qatar, accusing it of being a ""high-level"" sponsor of terrorism. However, the Arab states involved in the crisis are all close allies of the US, while the largest US base in the Middle East is in Qatar. Do you live in Qatar?

Confusion in Camden as evacuation begins,"As the sun set on Swiss Cottage, there was frustration among residents of the Chalcots estate. With five tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen. Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents. Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports. Emmanuel, 18, said they had ""not been told anything"". ""I'm angry to an extent that they didn't tell us sooner."" Some residents complained about the lack of warning During live broadcasts, one woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: ""Can you tell me what's going on?"" There was a steady trickle of families walking out of Taplow with an array of suitcases, satchels and bags for life. An elderly man called George, wearing a suit and carrying a small duffle bag, was trying to re-enter the complex. His neighbour shouted: ""They'll only kick you out again George. Your best bet is to go back to the leisure centre."" George - like many other residents - did not want to speak to the media. Residents have been offered temporary accommodation by Camden Council Many residents were sent to the Swiss Cottage leisure centre, to learn where their temporary accommodation would be. Some people said that - despite the evacuation - they wanted to stay at home. By 21:00 BST, council employees were going floor-by-floor to tell residents who did not know about the evacuation. Brian, who lives on the fifth floor of Taplow tower, said: ""It's a weird time to kick people out, especially as it's most children's bedtime."" Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq said: ""I realise it's disruptive to people's lives but constituents safety comes first. ""If it's not safe then people need to go."" The Labour MP said it was a ""tough decision"" for Camden Council to make, but added: ""This building is not safe for our residents. ""Our council could not let residents stay overnight."" The number of people evacuated from the five tower blocks could be in the thousands Edward Strange was travelling to Salisbury with his family when news broke on the radio. They turned back immediately to find out what was going on. He said that the evacuation was a ""complete overreaction"", adding that two previous fires in Taplow were ""easily contained"". He intended to stay with friends for the first night, but said he could not impose his family on them for much longer. Camden Council has said the works could take up to four weeks. The number of residents being evacuated from the 800 homes is unknown, but it could be in the thousands. Ms Siddiq said that the council had block-booked hotel rooms and were offering them to all residents. Some people chose to stay the night with friends or relatives Four miles from the Chalcots estate stands the charred remains ofGrenfell Tower. At least 79 people are feared dead after a fire engulfed the 24-storey building earlier this month. Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said: ""I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything."" Louise Simons, who lives in nearby Primrose Hill, came to the tower blocks to offer any displaced residents a spare bed for the evening. ""We live locally and have been impacted by the events of Grenfell,"" she said. ""Obviously we wanted to help.""

Canada community hit by suicides crisis,"Like Wapekeka First Nation, Attawapiskat has also struggled with suicide A Canadian aboriginal community has declared a state of emergency following the suicide of three teenage girls. Chief Brennan Sainnawap of the remote Wapekeka First Nation in northern Ontario made the declaration this week. On 13 June, Jenera Roundsky, 12, became the latest child to die as part of a suicide pact. In January, two other 12-year-old girls killed themselves. The community says almost 40 youths are considered to be at risk in a town of about 400 people. It is the latest suicide crisis to hit a Canadian aboriginal community. Last year, Attawapiskat First Nation in Ontario declared a state of emergency after 11 people attempted to take their own lives in a single day. Over the summer, Wapekeka notified Health Canada that they had become aware some girls had entered into a suicide pact and asked for about C$380,000 (Â£225,000; $286,000) to create a youth suicide prevention programme. Leaders of the village also met Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to talk about the community's suicide crisis. Health Canada said it would send the funds but Wakepeka says it has so far only received $95,000 - a quarter of what was promised. Teen suicide on the rise among Canadian girls In January, an anonymous donor pledged to send $380,000 to help prevent youth suicide in the community when the federal funds were slow in coming. Wapekeka spokesman Joshua Frogg told the BBC on Friday that the donor only eventually sent $30,000, which went to hiring one mental health worker for a couple of months. Mr Frogg's niece, Chantell Fox, was one of the three girls who committed suicide. He spoke in January at a news conference in Ottawa, pleading for a national strategy on suicide. The Toronto Starreported that Jenera Roundsky,externalwas found dead on 13 June at the local hockey rink. She had reportedly texted a friend to say goodbye. Chantell and Jolynn Winter both died less than six months earlier. On Friday, Health Canada said in a statement that it has been funding additional crisis supports since last winter. That includes four mental health counsellors whose positions are funded until March 2019. The federal agency also says it has provided Wapekeka with close to $1m for the delivery of their community health programmes since last April. Ontario Indigenous Relations Minister David Zimmer said in a statement on Friday that the province is working with regional and federal partners to help coordinate the response for additional support. The province also committed $50,000 last week in response for sport and recreation activities for youth there. ""The conditions that lead to despair and hopelessness are complex and multi-layered.  We all have a responsibility to address these conditions seriously,"" Mr Zimmer said. Last year, Ontario's Attawapiskat community saw 28 suicide attempts in March and more than 100 since September 2015. The regional Weeneebayko Health Authority flew in a crisis team, mental health nurses and social workers to help with the crisis. Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 First Nation communities within northern Ontario including Wapekeka and Attawapiskat, said earlier this year that 17 people died due to suicide across the region between January 2016  and January 2017. It criticised the ""current piecemeal approach to this perpetual crisis"" by the federal government. From Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911.

Flats evacuated over fire risk fears,"This video can not be played Camden residents react to tower block evacuations More than 700 flats in tower blocks on an estate in the Swiss Cottage area of north-west London have been evacuated because of fire safety concerns. Camden Council said people in four towers on the Chalcots estate were moved for ""urgent fire safety works"". The council added it was booking hotels but around 100 residents have spent the night on air beds in a leisure centre. The estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. Camden Council said it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate. It also said there were concerns about the insulation of gas pipes going into flats, and fire doors. The council initially announced the evacuation of one tower block, Taplow, but later extended the move to all five tower blocks it had checked. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the council then announced that one of the five - Blashford - did not need to be evacuated, and residents could return. Blashford is smaller and has ""several different design elements"". This video can not be played Air beds laid out in Swiss Cottage leisure centre Residents of the estate attended a public meeting with council officials on Thursday evening. The council's Labour leader, Georgia Gould, said the decision to evacuate the buildings was made at 18:30 BST on Friday. She said the fire service ""told us they could not guarantee our residents' safety in those blocks"". Some residents said the first they heard of the evacuation was on the news. The council has secured 270 hotel rooms so far. Emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. ""We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation,"" the council said. ""I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything and I just don't believe we can take any risk with our residents' safety and I have to put them first,"" Ms Gould said. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Absolutely the right decision"" to evacuate buildings She said the work is expected to take three to four weeks. Residents will be allowed in at the weekend to collect more possessions under escort from the fire brigade. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,external: ""My thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight."" She said the government was ""offering every support we can"" to residents and officials working at the estate. Alex Regan, BBC News As the sun set on Swiss Cottage, there was frustration among residents of the Chalcots estate. With tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen. Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents. Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports. Most were not in the mood to talk. One woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: ""Can you tell me what's going on?"" Confusion as evacuation begins This video can not be played Camden Council head Georgia Gould: 'Residents' safety comes first' Teacher Kim Price, who lives in Blashford tower with her 14-year-old son, said: ""At 4pm today they said it would be okay and that all the checks were fine. ""And now all of a sudden the news is saying we should get out. ""We've had two letters in two days saying 'you're not safe' then 'you're safe'. I don't really know what to do."" Edward Strange, who lives in an 11th floor flat with his wife and young daughter, said the evacuation was a ""complete overreaction"". He told the BBC there had been two previous fires in the block which were easily contained. ""I've got a young daughter, a wife and a cat, I've also got a job. They said it'd take four to six weeks. If the council says four to six weeks it'll take four to six months."" Among those evacuated was Peter Bertram, 94, who has lived on the estate for 46 years. The former RAF airman, who served in World War Two, said having to leave his home at short notice was a ""shock"". ""My neighbour told me 'Get this and that'. It happened so quick, I don't have the energy for that now. It's an experience."" Bob O'Toole, chair of Chalcots Estate residents' association, told BBC Breakfast that contractors had been working overnight in several of the tower blocks. ""A lot of people are annoyed because of the way [the evacuation] was done. They're saying it was left too late in the evening. But Camden Council didn't get the information till late, and they acted on that as quickly as possible."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said other areas, such as Plymouth and Manchester, had seen measures introduced such as 24-hour fire wardens and did not need evacuating. ""What was very different here is that the local fire service found multiple other failures in fire safety that should have already been in place in the towers, and as a result of that, they've made this quite correct decision."" Mr Javid also said the government would ""work with"" any local authorities and housing associations that needed financial support to carry out necessary fire safety work in tower blocks. ""Public safety is absolutely paramount, you cannot put a price on people's lives. So local authorities have to do whatever it takes to get their buildings safe."" The estate underwent a Â£66m refurbishment Samples from the tower blocks on the Chalcots estate were examined this week Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said people who were in towers where cladding was being investigated would be ""living in fear"". ""I've had hundreds of constituents contacting my office over the last week, asking whether the buildings they're living in are safe. ""People need to give significant weight to the voice of residents, and if they do want to be moved, if they feel unsafe and haven't been reassured, then provision should be put in place [to move them]."" Camden Council agreed a contract with Rydon Construction torefurbish the Chalcots estate in May 2006 at a cost of Â£66m. The work took more than three and a half years. Five towers received new cladding, and 711 flats were modernised with new wiring, heating, kitchens and bathrooms. Friday night's announcement came as theMetropolitan Police said the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests. 'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire London fire: Who are the victims? A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests.

Fire cladding tests failed by 27 blocks,"This video can not be played Watch: Camden resident confronts council chief Cladding on 34 tower blocks in 17 council areas in England has failed fire safety tests, the government says. So far, every sample has failed the tests. The government plans to examine cladding from up to 600 blocks. The updated figures came as people from the Chalcots Estate in Swiss Cottage, north London, spent a second night away from their homes. But - across the country - not every block that fails safety tests will be evacuated. Four of the five blocks on the Chalcots Estate were evacuated on Friday because of fears over cladding, gas pipes, and fire doors. Camden Council said it had no option but to move residents from 650 flats while work takes place. Council leader Georgia Gould said staff would continue asking those who had not yet left to vacate their flats. ""By remaining in the blocks these residents risk delaying the work that is required and that we are undertaking to make these homes safe. ""It is not safe to remain in these blocks and our residents' safety will continue to be the council's number one priority."" Almost 200 offers of accommodation have been made to displaced residents, and most of these have been taken up. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid - while agreeing with the decision in Camden - said: ""A failure in testing of the cladding does not necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated. ""The decision by Camden council was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures."" This video can not be played Watch: Meet Rosie, who refused to leave Taplow Tower in Camden Plymouth is one of the affected areas. The elected leader of the city council, Ian Bowyer, said: ""We are not proposing to evacuate... ""The failures that have been attributed to the blocks in Camden are not present here in the three tower blocks in Plymouth."" The Local Government Association said some councils have introduced 24-hour warden patrols to mitigate the risk before cladding is removed. The Department for Communities and Local Government's testing programme, which began on Wednesday, is able to test 100 samples a day. If needed, further lab capability could be provided. Mr Javid said testing was taking place ""around the clock"". Although every sample has failed the test so far, he pointed out that local authorities have been asked to prioritise buildings they had most concern over. Seven of the 17 local authorities where high-rise buildings have failed fire safety tests have been named. They are: Camden - where residents have been evacuated from four blocks on the Chalcots Estate Brent - where a housing association tower block, Elizabeth House, has cladding but London Fire Brigade advises it is not a risk Barnet - where cladding put up on three towers in Granville Road, NW2, in 2012 is to be removed as precautionary measure Hounslow - where Clements Court tower in Cranford is to have outer cladding removed Manchester - where 78 panels are being removed from one area of theVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe Salford - where cladding is also to be removed from nine tower blocks Plymouth - where three blocks on theMount Wise Tower estatewere found to have cladding made from similar material to Grenfell Tower Portsmouth - where the city council is removing cladding fromHoratia House and Leamington House in Somerstown The Chalcots Estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79 people. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. One flat destroyed in London fire Confusion and anger after evacuation Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer After the evacuation, emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. Camden Council - which said it already spent Â£500,000 on hotel rooms - said it would reimburse residents who have paid for their own temporary accommodation. It has also set aside Â£100,000 for food and essential items for displaced residents. Fire crews have been put on watch at the Chalcots estate The work at Chalcots is expected to take three to four weeks. Sayed Mead, a resident on the estate who left his flat, told BBC Breakfast that not knowing where he was going to be housed had been ""eating me away"". He was eventually told at midnight on Saturday where he and his mother can stay, and said it felt like ""I'm going to start my life all over again"". He also said the council had created ""panic"" among the residents. Despite being urged to leave, around 20 households had refused to vacate their homes by Saturday evening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said councils across the country needed to deal ""swiftly and effectively with the scale of the fire safety challenge"" posed by the Grenfell Tower fire. ""This is now a nationwide threat and the prime minister needs to get a grip,"" he added. Do you live in one of the tower blocks that have failed fire cladding safety tests?

The online groups of men who avoid masturbation,"Alexander Rhodes has turned the NoFap idea into a brand and an organisation Their motivations vary, but a growing number of men are gathering online in communities devoted to abstinence not only from sex, but also masturbation. It has more than 230,000 members, or about as many as forums devoted to Bitcoin and Bernie Sanders. But r/NoFap - one of the boards or ""subreddits"" on community-based site Reddit - is filled with men trying to avoid masturbating. And while some users claim ""superpowers"" and warn of the dangers of porn and sex addiction, there is little advice in the forum being offered from qualified medical professionals. The term ""fap"" is a relatively new onomatopoeic synonym for masturbation which cropped up in a Japanese comic strip in 1999. The ""NoFap"" community has had a steady increase in its membership since it started in 2011, and has spawned an organisation and spinoff groups, some devoted to particular religious communities. In some ways the movement is an offshoot of the huge demand for online health advice. Talking about sex and masturbation, of course, is taboo in many places around the world, and the NoFap subreddit brings in an international crowd. Secure in their anonymity, group members openly discuss ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"" periods of time spent masturbating and counsel each other with tips and techniques on abstinence. One typical message reads: ""If you just keep on adding up days without doing it, one more day on another, while holding back any such urges to porn or anything, you'll abstain from it eventually."" A recurring topic is the issue of total abstinence from ""pornography, masturbating and orgasm"" - abbreviated to ""PMO"". Many on the forum believe avoiding PMO promotes a rise in testosterone levels in the body and even creates ""superpowers"". One subscriber posted: ""Just hit two weeks [abstaining] for the first time ever... In my opinion, we all have the capacity to be energized, focused, and productive. PMO, however, eliminates our desire to be this way, which is why it is so toxic to our wellbeing."" The founder of the NoFap organisation, Alexander Rhodes, explains that the idea of ""superpowers"" isn't really meant to be taken literally. The Reddit group ""NoFap"" has nearly a quarter of a million subscribers ""We're talking about what you would be if you weren't being subjected to a super stimuli which causes you to prefer pixels on a screen rather than sex with human beings,"" Rhodes tells BBC Trending radio. ""'Superpowers' is a return to normalcy, whether it's increased self confidence or free time or energy... they're not being held back by pornography any longer."" While many people would question the presumption that porn and masturbation are inseparable, NoFap users are convinced of the dangers of porn addiction. But others aren't quite as convinced that they are clinical disorders - or that abstinence is the answer. Porn and sex addiction are yet to be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the ""bible of psychiatry"" which is issued by the American Psychiatric Association, althoughsome studieshave shown that porn has an effect on the brain similar to drugs or alcohol. Stream or downloadon BBC Trending radio Paula Hall is a psychotherapist and specialises in the treatment of people who say they are addicted to sex and porn. She doesn't think abstaining from masturbation is a long-term solution when treating clients who would describe themselves as porn addicts. ""For some a period of abstinence is helpful for them to be able to get to know what their natural libido is like,"" she says. ""But for many, particularly for those that are single so may not have any other sexual outlet, trying complete abstinence from masturbation is very difficult and can be very disheartening."" ""The key thing to understand in all addictions is that it's the function of the behaviour that defines it as an addiction,"" she says. ""So whether you're somebody who is compulsively viewing animated pornography or someone who is compulsively chatting online or someone who is compulsively visiting sex workers, it's that dependency on the behaviour that defines it as addiction."" BBC Radio 1 - BBC Advice - Masturbation BBC Three - Why we all need to open up about masturbation Masturbation 'cuts cancer risk',external Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Alexander Rhodes points to the growing ranks of NoFap forum users as evidence of the need for groups like his to help men struggling to cope with their internet pornography habits. ""'NoFap' is an organisation that supports its users regardless of what their goals might be as long as they're trying to improve their sexual health and live their sexual habits in a way that they want to,"" he says, pointing out that abstinence is not the ultimate aim of all participants. ""We don't have a unified goal. Some people want to masturbate some people don't want to masturbate - it hosts a wide variety of people with different viewpoints.""

Reality Check: How many people are affected by May's offer?,"Theresa May told other EU leaders on Thursday that a new ""UK settled status"" would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years, rights to stay and access to health, education and other benefits. She said the proposals depend on other EU states guaranteeing UK citizens the same rights. So, how many EU nationals live in the UK and where do they come from? And which of the other 27 EU countries host most UK citizens? The number of citizens of the other 27 EU countries living in the UK in 2015 wasestimated by the Office of National Statistics,external(ONS) to be around 3.2 million. Polish citizens topped the list with 916,000 - more than any other nationality. In 2001, there were only 38,000 Polish nationals living in the UK. Irish nationals are the second largest EU group in the UK, estimated at 332,000 in 2015. In 2001, there were only 5,000 Romanians living in the UK. Romania joined the EU in 2007, but its citizens were not allowed to seek employment in the UK freely until 2014. There are now 233,000 Romanians living in the UK, making them the third biggest EU group of migrants. There has been a notable increase in the number of migrants from the older EU member states too: Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. Ananalysis by the ONS,external, published in January 2017, suggests that an estimated 900,000 UK citizens are long-term residents of other EU countries. Spain hosted the highest number of migrants from the UK with 309,000. More than 100,000 of them are aged 65 and over. France was second with 157,062, and Ireland third with 112,090. These numbers are all estimates, generally based on extrapolations of countries' censuses, which are carried out every 10 years. An earlierestimate by the UN,externalput the figure of UK nationals in the EU slightly higher, at 1.2 million. Welooked at their breakdownlast year.

China landslide leaves 100 missing,"This video can not be played The rescue team has been searching for missing people The bodies of 15 people have been found after a landslide in Sichuan province in south-western China left more than 120 people missing, state media say. About 40 homes were destroyed in Xinmo village in Maoxian county, after the side of a mountain collapsed at about 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT Friday). Rescue teams are frantically searching for survivors trapped beneath rocks dislodged by heavy rainfall. President Xi Jinping urged rescuers to ""spare no effort"". A couple and a baby were rescued and taken to hospital after teams of workers used ropes to move large rocks, AFP news agency reports, citing local authorities. Qiao Dashuai told CCTV the baby had woken them and when they came to the door of their home they were swept away by water. He said his parents and other relatives were still missing. Rescue workers are frantically searching for survivors feared buried beneath rocks Bulldozers were used to help move large boulders after homes were destroyed Medical staff joined the search in the hope of assisting any survivors An earlier toll of 141 missing people has now been revised down by state media. The landslide blocked a 2km (1.2-mile) stretch of a river, Xinhua news agency reported. Local police told state broadcaster CCTV a lack of vegetation in the area had made the landslide worse. Local officials said some 8m cu m (282m cu ft) of rock had been dislodged. Roads in the county were closed on Saturday to all traffic except emergency services, the news agency said.

Building society's account deadline axed,"A deadline for the closure of current accounts with the Norwich and Peterborough (N&P) has been cancelled, with 30% of customers still to receive letters explaining the move. It was announced in January that the building society's brand is to be abolished, some branches closed, and current accounts shut down. The plan was for customers to move or close accounts by the end of August. But its owner, the Yorkshire Building Society, now says there is no deadline. The Yorkshire - the UK's second biggest mutual - said that about 35% of the 100,000 customers affected had already closed their current account, switched to another bank, or was in the process of doing so. It was staggering the flow of letters to affected customers to avoid a rush of inquiries, and has now written to 70% of those affected. The remaining letters will be sent by the end of July. The Yorkshire will close 28 N&P branches this year. The remaining branches will be rebranded as Yorkshire Building Society branches. A spokeswoman for the Yorkshire said: ""We are continuing to work closely with other financial providers in assisting customers to switch or close their account. We're writing to customers with details of what they need to do next, and asking that customers complete the closure or switch of their account within six months of receiving their letter. We have not set a final date for closure. ""If a customer has not taken steps to close or switch their account within six months of receiving of their letter, we will work closely with the customer on a case-by-case basis to facilitate a switch or closure."" In the meantime, no customers would be blocked from depositing money or conducting any normal banking transactions via their current account, she said. The N&P is not part of the Current Account Switching Service so the process will be slower than could have been the case, taking about 12 days. It was feared that some cash incentives to switch offered by rivals would not have applied, but many providers are now offering the perks to customers moving from the N&P. Mike Regnier, chief executive of the Yorkshire Building Society, toldBBC Radio 4's Money Boxearlier this year that it was a ""real shame"" that the accounts had to close. He said that too much investment would be required to keep the current accounts compliant with regulation if offered by the mutual. Instead it is to concentrate on savings and mortgage products.

Depp sorry for Trump assassination 'joke',"This video can not be played Johnny Depp: ""When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" Actor Johnny Depp has apologised for remarks he made about US President Donald Trump in a speech at the Glastonbury Festival. Depp told People magazine it was in ""poor taste"", did not ""come out as intended"" and was only meant to amuse. Depp had asked the crowd: ""When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" Trump supporters condemned the actor and the White House described his comments as ""sad"". Depp's remarks on Thursday came as he introduced a screening of his film The Libertine at the festival in south-west England. Is Depp in trouble over Trump remarks? Get to know the headliners 12 things that will definitely happen BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen Full Glastonbury line-up He asked: ""Can you bring Trump here?"" After receiving jeers from the crowd, he added: ""You misunderstand completely. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? ""I want to clarify. I'm not an actor. I lie for a living [but] it's been a while. Maybe it's about time. ""I think he needs help and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go."" The star acknowledged that his comments - which may have been a reference to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by actor John Wilkes Booth in 1865 - would prove controversial. Depp said on Friday: ""I apologise for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump. ""It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone."" After his initial comment, a White House statement on behalf of the president said it was ""sad"" that Depp had not followed Mr Trump's lead in condemning all violence. ""I hope that some of Mr Depp's colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democratic elected official,"" the statement read. White House press secretary Sean Spicer echoed that on Friday, saying: ""The president has made it clear that we should denounce violence in all of its forms and I think that if we're going to hold to that standard then we should agree that that standard should be universally called out."" Depp reappeared at Glastonbury on Friday, playing guitar on stage with Kris Kristofferson. Depp is not the first US celebrity to allude to killing the president. At a rally in Washington DC, Madonna said shethought ""an awful lot about blowing up the White House""and the US rapper Snoop Doggshot a toy gun at a Donald Trump characterin a music video.
