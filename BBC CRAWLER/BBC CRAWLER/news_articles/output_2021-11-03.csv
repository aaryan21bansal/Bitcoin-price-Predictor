Missiles and fireworks thrown at police in Lanark Way,"Two boys, aged 12 and 15, were arrested during the disorder Violence involving about 100 people in Lanark Way in west Belfast on Wednesday night has been condemned by the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Two boys, aged 12 and 15, were arrested on suspicion of riotous behaviour. They were later released on bail. ""No one wants to see this escalate and a return to images of the past"" said Simon Byrne. Mr Byrne was speaking at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. ""I think we want to see this in terms of a small-scale isolated incident and support the community in trying to dial down the rhetoric of what we saw yesterday,"" he said. A protestagainst the Northern Ireland Protocolhad been planned in the area on Wednesday. Police said less than a dozen people gathered for it. Police said the disorder lasted for a couple of hours Officers were deployed to Lanark Way shortly after 17:00 GMT. Wheelie bins were burnt on the road and missiles were thrown at police officers and police vehicles. There were no reports of any injuries to members of the public or police officers but a number of police vehicles were damaged after being attacked with masonry. Police said order was restored by about 22:30 and an evidence gathering operation is under way. Three police vehicles were damaged during the incident and are now ""off the road"", according to Ch Supt Jones. Missiles and fireworks were thrown at police in north Belfast Sinn FÃ©in assembly member (MLA) Pat Sheehan urged unionist politicians to call for an ""immediate end to these dangerous and provocative stunts at interfaces before someone is seriously hurt"". ""Tonight's trouble is a direct consequence of the dangerous and irresponsible stunt organised by loyalists at the Lanark Way interface this evening... with the sole intention of heightening tensions and causing trouble,"" he added. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Mike Nesbitt said that if anyone had blocked Lanark Way as a protest of any kind it was ""wrong, illegal and counter-productive"". SDLP west Belfast representative Paul Doherty said fireworks and missiles were launched on both sides of the interface on Lanark Way. He told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he went to the area to ""try to talk people down"" but ""some listened, others were intent on creating carnage"". ""These actions do nothing but cause misery to the long-suffering people who live at these interface areas,"" he said. Earlier this week,a bus was set on fire after being hijacked by armed, masked men in Newtownards, County Down. Politicians linked that attack to opposition to the protocol. The protocol is the special Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Unionist politicians say the arrangement undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK.

'Tour de force' novel wins Booker Prize,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons South African author Damon Galgut has won the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction at the third attempt for his novel The Promise. Galgut, who was previously nominated in 2003 and 2010, picked up the Â£50,000 prize at a ceremony on Wednesday. The Promise is his ninth book and follows the decline of one South African family over four decades from the apartheid era to the present day. The chair of the judges, Maya Jasanoff, described it as ""a tour de force"". ""It combines an extraordinary story, rich themes and the history of the last 40 years of South Africa in an incredibly well-wrought package,"" she said. ""It manages to pull together the qualities of great storytelling, it has great ideas, it's a book that has a lot to chew on, with remarkable attention to structure and literary style."" The author said he was ""really profoundly, humbly grateful"" for the award. ""I'm not used to winning things,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. ""And I just assumed that would be the case last night. ""Perhaps nobody was more amazed than me when things went my way."" Damon Galgut had been nominated for the Booker Prize twice before Analysis by Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent The Promise by Damon Galgut is an excellent winner. In my view it is an outstanding book and it is hard to disagree with the critic who said: ""This is so obviously one of the best novels of the year."" Why? On the one hand it is a gripping saga, following the decline and fall of a white South African family over four decades. It is packed with incident - sex, drugs, shootings - and there is drama, discord and death. But there is also plenty of unexpected comedy to lighten the mood. It made me laugh. On the other hand, through the lens of this one family, The Promise also deftly tells the story of South Africa and its troubled transition from apartheid state to multi-racial democracy. So it is rich with layers and yet it is compact, with fewer than 300 pages. It is also technically superb. There is an invisible narrator, who acts like a film camera. So you move fluidly from one location to another, from one character's point of view to another, sometimes within the same paragraph or page. At one point we fly into someone's dreams. At another we dive into the feelings of a pack of hyenas and even a family dog. Damon Galgut nearly died from cancer as a young child. In 2010 he told me it was the central, cataclysmic event of his life. Books provided comfort during his illness. When he finally recovered he was left with the overwhelming need to write. Now he has won one of the biggest prizes in publishing. The Promise begins in 1986 and revisits the family over the course of four funerals, each in a different decade and at a different point in the nation's journey. The title refers to a pledge that the white family's black maid would be given the house she inhabits and the land it stands on. Galgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria and told the Today programme that it also refers to the unfulfilled promise in South Africa after apartheid, the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government. Galgut was one of six writers to be shortlisted for the prize ""I'm far from alone in saying that I think, in 1994, in our first free elections, there was a sense of great promise in the air that South Africa could at last change its course and become a different sort of country, and I certainly don't think that promise has been fulfilled,"" he said. The ""portrait"" his book paints of modern South Africa ""is not a happy one"", he told reporters after the ceremony. ""I had no agenda in describing it that way, but things are not great with us right now, so you could read that as a warning or a portrait, I don't know, but South Africa has seen better days."" But he said his win was a sign that more attention was being paid to African literature. ""The fact that the Nobel Prize winner this year came from Africa, the fact that the Booker has gone to an African, would suggest that the volume is going up on Africa,"" he said. ""I hope that's a process that will continue and that people will take African writing a little more seriously, because there's a lot of great writing coming from us."" The Promise was widely praised when it was published in the UK in June, with The Guardian calling it ""stunning"", The Sunday Times describing it as ""bleak but superbly narrated"" and The Financial Times declaring it ""a complex, ambitious, brilliant work"". The other nominated books were: Anuk Arudpragasam - A Passage North Patricia Lockwood - No One Is Talking About This Nadifa Mohamed - The Fortune Men Richard Powers - Bewilderment Maggie Shipstead - Great Circle Last year's Booker Prize waswon by Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain. The Scottish author said the victory ""changed everything for me"", with the novel shooting up best-seller lists as a result and now being adapted into a TV series.

Iran nuclear talks to resume within weeks,"Talks aimed at reviving the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six other nations are to resume this month. Iran's chief negotiator Ali Baqeri Kani said that his government had agreed to meet in Vienna on 29 November. The discussions have been on hold since the election of Iran's new hard-line president in June. The US pulled out of the deal under President Donald Trump, but Washington has since said it could consider rejoining. The Biden administration said it will attend the Vienna meet, along with the remaining signatories, the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia. Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, Mr Kani said Iran had ""agreed to start the negotiations aiming at removal of unlawful and inhumane sanctions on 29 November in Vienna"". Ned Price, a spokesperson for the US State Department, said that a deal could be reached quickly if Iran's representatives were ""serious"". But he added that the US would expect negotiations to pick up where they left off after the sixth round of talks in Vienna in June. Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi is expected to take a tough approach to negotiations. Western nations have been calling on Iran to re-join negotiations for months, warning that Tehran's nuclear advances have now strayed significantly beyond the limits set by the original deal. Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to restrictions on its enrichment of uranium, which has civilian uses but can also be used in nuclear weapons; the amount of that material it could stockpile; and also the type of machinery (centrifuges) used to perform the enriching. In addition, it agreed to allow international inspections. In return, it got a lifting of sanctions. But Mr Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reintroduced the sanctions after failing to get Iran to agree to provisions to curb its ballistic missile programme and end its involvement in regional conflicts. Since the re-introduction of sanctions, Iran has been unable to access billions of dollars of its assets held in foreign banks. World powers don't trust Iran:Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move.

Oil giant says it needs oil to fund green shift,"The boss of oil giant Shell has insisted it can transition to net zero by 2050, but it will need the cash from its oil and gas business to pay for it. Ben van Beurden dismissed splitting its legacy oil and gas business from its renewables investment, a move urged by activist shareholder Third Point. Talking exclusively to the BBC, he said the company's plans for greener energy could only be funded by oil and gas. ""At this point in time [the cash] comes from our legacy business,"" he said. Mr van Beurden was speaking at Europe's biggest oil refinery at Pernis near Rotterdam, a facility he plans to transform from refining petrol and diesel, to making biofuels and hydrogen over the next decade. This video can not be played Shell boss Ben van Beurden talks to BBC News exclusively about its transition to net zero. ""These things can only be done if you have a facility (like Pernis) to work with and if you have the cash. ""If we have to build a hydrogen plant from a wind farm that we build in the North Sea for a billion dollars that is not going to be funded by a hydrogen business - it will be funded by the oil and gas business,"" he said. But oil and gas is not just a legacy business. Shell wants to develop new oilfields including  Cambo in the North Sea which it hopes will produce 170 million barrels of oil. How does he justify that? Mr van Beurden says the decision on the Cambo oilfield is ultimately one for government but says it makes no sense to substitute UK resources for foreign imports to satisfy domestic demand. He said: ""Why would you say: Let's not get our oil and gas demands from our own resources but let's import from somewhere else, probably with a larger carbon footprint. ""I don't think that it is going to contribute to the balance of payment for the UK and also will not help the carbon footprint of the world."" Shell currently has a global carbon footprint the size of Russia's if you include the emissions from customers using Shell products. It plans to spend four times as much on oil and gas development as on renewables next year. This is why some doubt that Shell can hit either its own targets and those imposed by a Dutch court which require it to halve its own net emissions by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050. Shell is planning to appeal part of the ruling. Shell is also expected to make its best efforts to reduce the emissions of its customers - which make up 90% of Shell's overall carbon footprint. Shell intends to appeal that court judgement. Shu Ling Liauw from research firm Global Climate Insights  has analysed the oil firm's spending plans and estimates that Shell will be producing more emissions by 2030 than it is now as it intends to grow its gas business. ""Even if you're very generous, and assume they get all the amounts of carbon capture and storage and offsets that they need, they might just miss their 2030 targets, and they will not be able to deliver on 2050. ""In fact, they will be increasing emissions until 2030, and still be producing significant amounts of emissions in 2050,"" she says. Mr van Beurden says these estimates are speculative and insists Shell is on track, having cut the carbon intensity of its own operations by 17% since 2016. Shell is a major component of the UK's leading share index. If you have a pension you are almost certainly a part owner of Shell, BP and other oil and gas companies. There is growing clamour on the part of many pension fund trustees and their scheme members to dump or divest shares in fossil fuel businesses to starve them of capital. That would be a mistake, according the world's largest asset manager Blackrock which looks after 13 trillion dollars in pensions and savings. ""You can't divest from the world. It's much better to engage with companies and use your influence as a shareholder. If you divest, you lose that influence,"" said Sandy Boss, head of investment stewardship. Others point out that if Shell itself were to sell its oil and gas business, those assets would be hoovered up by companies that might be less transparent and less inclined to make the effort to decarbonise. As the recent energy crisis brutally exposed, the UK along with the rest of the world is still hugely reliant on fossil fuel. That reliance needs to be managed down over time according to Mr van Beurden otherwise we will see price shocks in the future that will be counterproductive. ""I think this energy transition can be done but it will require a lot of orchestration and a lot of faith of society that it can be done. ` ""If you want to destroy the faith by driving up energy prices, by creating shortages or market failures, I think politicians are going to lose societal acceptance that this is actually doable."" As powerful as Shell is, its customers may be more powerful. As long as there is demand for fossil fuels. Shell or someone else will supply it. That demand can be influenced by government carrot or stick, companies can be squeezed by financiers but consumer behaviour will ultimately determine whether the world can hit net zero by 2050.

Five arrests as hundreds march in Glasgow,"One protester was carried away by police officers Five activists have been arrested as hundreds of climate change protesters marched through Glasgow. Scuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building. Police said other arrests were made following ""assaults"" on officers who had paint sprayed in their faces. Most of the demonstrations against corporate ""greenwashing"" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers. The biggest protests of the summit so far began with hundreds of campaigners gathering in the city centre to highlight what they see as the exaggeration of green credentials by big businesses. Some then headed for the offices of SSE where police and security staff prevented activists entering the building, and four arrests were made including two people who, according to the police, sprayed paint at officers. Gary Ritchie, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said they received first aid at the scene before opting to return to the operation, which he described as ""very effective"" and ""very well planned"". Follow live coverage of COP26 Private firms could be used to clear Glasgow's bins Biden leaves Scotland hailing COP26 progress Police close road as protesters march near M8 Another protest took place outside the offices of JP Morgan, where a green flare was let off. Extinction Rebellion said about 500 demonstrators were later ""kettled"" at St Vincent Street before being allowed to move off with a heavy police escort towards the city's Broomielaw next to the River Clyde. Amid shouting and pushing, several protesters fell and police medics helped at least one woman who was injured. ACC Ritchie said most protesters had been ""fairly compliant"" with police ""in negotiations"" with the group about their intentions. ""They have told us they would like to proceed to another part of the city and we have agreed to that,"" he said. ""But for public safety reasons we will be escorting the protesters as they make their way to that location."" ACC Ritchie said police would ""protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community"". He added: ""We will provide a proportionate policing response to any protest and violence will not be tolerated. ""Assaults on officers, who put their safety at risk every day to keep the public safe and have adopted a facilitative and rights-based approach to protest, is totally unacceptable."" Eyewitness: Cameron Buttle, BBC Scotland reporter in Glasgow city centre For around two hours hundreds of public order police were chasing a group of protesters around the centre of Glasgow. It was a hugely difficult operation to police; as soon as a street was blocked the protesters disappeared down a lane or backtracked and took a different route. Eventually a group of about 150 were held in a block just off Renfield Street. It was noisy, passionate and occasionally very tense. I did see some scuffles breaking out in front me but it calmed down very quickly. Eventually the police cordon moved slowly through the city taking the group down towards the main conference venue. Some protesters complained about the police operation, saying it was over the top and heavy handed. The police said they feared that main routes were going to be blocked and said the action was proportionate. Campaigners also used the demonstrations to object to the planned Cambo oil field off Shetland,  on  the anniversary of the Queen inaugurating the flow of North Sea oil in 1975. Friends of the Earth Scotland, along with the campaign groups Platform and Stop Cambo, took part in protest events. Activists took part in a Green Rebellion greenwashing protest on Glasgow's Buchanan Street Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said an environmentalreview of the new Cambo oil fieldshould be carried out before extraction begins. The UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has backed the project, saying Cambo is ""priced in"" to the UK government's plans to reduce emissions. Rosemary Harris, of Platform, said there should be no new investment in oil and gas. She said: ""Any new oil and gas production is continuing to support a declining industry. There's a lot of talk about it being important for jobs, but they should be creating pathways for workers outside oil and gas."" Inside the conference hall, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to cut carbon emissions by rewiring the ""entire global financial system"". He said the plan would help persuade firms investing in fossil fuels to instead put their money into green energy and technologies. About 450 of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension companies, which control about Â£100tn, have signed up. More than 100 world leaders were in Glasgow for the first two days of the COP26 summit but most have now left, leaving delegations to continue the negotiations. US President Joe Biden flew out on Tuesday night after a two-day visit. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Protests like anxiety dream, free speech row prof says","Prof Kathleen Stock says a protest against her was like a medieval experience A university professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity has said protests against her were like a ""terrible anxiety dream"". In a BBC interview, Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she quit her University of Sussex post following ""reputation trashing from colleagues"". She said it had been surreal to see her name ""plastered over every wall"" on student protest posters. The university said it unequivocally defended her right to free speech. Vice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell told staff in an email he had hoped Prof Stock would have felt able to return to work, and she would have been supported. But the philosophy professor told BBC's Woman's Hour the campaign against her was the ""end point"" of years of negative treatment by colleagues that had become ""exhausting"". Prof Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more ""socially significant"" than biological sex,  said her views had been ""radically misrepresented"" to suggest she was bigoted or transphobic, something she categorically denies. But an online statement accompanying the campaign against her suggested Prof Stock ""has spent years campaigning for the exclusion of trans people from 'women's only spaces' and against trans and non-binary people's right to self-identify as any gender"". It also criticised her trusteeship of the LGB Alliance, which describes itself on Twitter as promoting ""the rights of lesbians, bisexuals & gay men, as recognised by biological sex"". The group is described by trans activists as transphobic, which it denies. In the interview aired on Wednesday, Prof Stock said: ""In almost every university... there are a small group of people who are absolutely opposed to the sorts of things I say and instead of getting involved in arguing with me using reason, evidence - the traditional university methods - they tell their students in lectures that I pose a harm to trans students. ""They go on Twitter to say that I'm a bigot so thus creating an atmosphere in which students become much more extreme and much more empowered to do what they did, I guess."" In October,posters were put up near the university campusand an accompanying social media campaign claimed Prof Stock ""makes trans students unsafe"". Photos also showed a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner reading ""Stock out"". Prof Stock told Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett the effect of the protests was ""head spinning"" and ""like some sort of surreal terrible anxiety dream to see your name plastered over every wall"". She described a protest at an open day when about 100 students were holding placards saying ""Stock out"", ''Fire her"", with flares being set off. ""I don't know if I can explain it but you have to imagine yourself at your workplaceâ¦ all eyes are on you, all fingers seem to be pointing at you, it's like a medieval experience,"" she said. ""At that point I wasn't scared so much as incredibly distressed."" The professor said she had received hundreds of letters of support and accused her critics of being ""out of step"" with the public. The ""tipping point"" that led to her resignation, she said, was when the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) released a statement which ""basically backed the protesters and implicitly made it obvious that they thought I was transphobic and accused Sussex University of institutional transphobia"". She had previously tweeted a screenshot of a message purportedly sent to all Sussex UCU members which didn't name her personally but urged university management to ""take a clear and strong stance against transphobia at Sussex"", including an ""urgent investigation"". The national branch of the UCU released a follow-up statement saying it was a ""proud and unequivocal supporter of trans rights"", opposed harassment and bullying and was ""not calling for any staff to be dismissed from their post"". The University of Sussex said it had publicly and internally fully supported Prof Stock's freedom of speech and would not tolerate the bullying and harassment of anyone in its community. Equalities minister Liz Truss and chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Baroness Kishwer Falkner both criticised the attacks on Prof Stock. Higher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said the campaign of harassment against her was ""deplorable"" and the situation should never have got that far.

Oxford Brookes students expelled over rape claim,"Two students were expelled from Oxford Brookes University following an allegation of gang rape, the BBC can confirm. A third was suspended after an appeal, and a fourth given a less serious punishment. The incident, first revealed in The Times, was reported to the university in February 2018. The university said it issued ""appropriate penalties"". The alleged victim was a 19-year-old student who claimed she did not consent to sex with any of the four students,according to the Times.,external A police investigation was carried out ""over a period of several months"" in 2018, a spokesman for Thames Valley Police told the BBC. However, it was ""decided that there was insufficient evidence to progress the case further"". The spokesman added that any new information relating to the investigation should be reported to the force. The Times reported that a separate investigation by the university resulted in two of the students being expelled. A third student's punishment was reduced - following an appeal - from expulsion to a term's suspension, and an order to write an apology letter to the alleged victim. A fourth was not found to have breached university regulations and was given a written warning, the paper added. Questions have been raised over the university's admissions policy, after it was reported that one of the students had been under investigation for sexual offences at a US university. Oxford Brookes was one of dozens of universities mentioned on the Everyone's Invited website The university said in a statement that sexual violence and harassment had ""no place at Oxford Brookes"". It said the incident was ""thoroughly investigated"" and that the university had liaised with the police. ""Appropriate penalties, including the most severe penalties available to the University in relation to some of the students, were applied and were upheld on appeal,"" it said. It said it recognised the ""very distressing nature of the allegations"" and that specialist support services had helped ""those most closely affected"". ""As part of our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and respectful culture, we are reviewing behaviour and practices within Brookes Sport, including all clubs, to ensure that policies and practices promote the culture, behaviours and values we expect of all our students,"" it added. Oxford Brookes was one of dozens of universities mentioned on theEveryone's Invited website, which made headlines in March after thousands of victims shared experiences of sexual assault and rape at schools and universities in the UK. At the time,the university said,externalit was ""very concerned"" by accounts of ""traumatic experiences"" at Oxford Brookes, and encouraged students to report incidents. Around the same time,a group of Oxford Brookes students campaignedfor better lighting in parts of the city, after Sarah Everard's murder sparked a debate over women's safety.

UK boat held by French in fishing row released,"The British trawler that was detained by France during the post-Brexit fishing row has been released by the French authorities. The Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan left the northern French port of Le Havre on Wednesday evening. The trawler's owner, Macduff Shellfish, said it was ""delighted"" that the crew and vessel could return home. French authorities held the boat last week, saying it did not have a licence. France delays sanctions as fishing talks continue Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Who really owns UK fishing rights? Menna Rawlings, the UK's ambassador to France, welcomed the news, tweeting: ""Glad to hear the Cornelis is free to leave Le Havre and that the Brits on board are on their way home tonight."" The dispute over post-Brexit fishing licences flared up last month, after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats. France then threatened a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by 2 November. But French President Emmanuel Macron suspended the threats at the 11th hour ahead of more talks between UK and French ministers on Thursday. Earlier, the trawler's skipper Jondy Ward told the BBC they had been ""caught in the middle"" of the political row. Mr Ward still faces trial in France next August regardless of Wednesday's court ruling that the boat can be released. He has been charged with illegal fishing without a licence in French waters - but the case could be dropped before it reaches trial. Andrew Brown, the public affairs director of Macduff Shellfish, said the crew were in good spirits, looking forward to returning to their loved ones and grateful for all the messages of support. No bail bond was needed to release the trawler, he said. It comes after Mr Ward's lawyer said the French authorities had demanded a bond of 150,000 euros (Â£127,000), which he argued was excessive given the total value of the produce on board was around 5,000 euros (Â£4,200). In short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters. Under the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years. But there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed. Big trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically. But smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed. Read more about post-Brexit fishing rules Downing Street acknowledged that France could reimpose its threats as Brexit minister Lord Frost prepared to hold talks with France's Europe minister Clement Beaune on Thursday. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""It's entirely up to the French government if they want to reimpose the threats that we saw they both announced and stood back from in recent days.""

"Covid restrictions return not ruled out, says Swann","Robin Swann said he and his executive colleagues would do all they could to avoid another lockdown The reintroduction of some Covid-19 restrictions cannot be ruled out, the health minister has said. However, Robin Swann said he and his executive colleagues would do ""all that we can"" to avoid another lockdown. Last month Mr Swann said Northern Ireland was ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"". Emergency departments reported high numbers of patients over the weekend,with one patient at the Ulster Hospital waiting 44 hours to be admitted. Many hospitals are currently operating over capacity. On Sunday nightclubs reopened in Northern Ireland and legal requirements on social distancing were also scrapped. People can now move around venues and stand to have a drink or eat food, and face coverings are not required when customers are dancing. Hospital doctor apologises for 'appalling service' Hospitals struggle amid 'stubbornly high' Covid rate Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, Mr Swann encouraged people to keep coming forward for vaccination. ""I hope that we don't get into a position where we have to go down the lengths of a further lockdown,"" he said. ""Will we have to look at further restrictions? Possibly. But I'll always take that advice from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser in regards to where we are."" Mr Swann said Northern Ireland still did not have enough nurses Mr Swann added that a lockdown would be a ""detrimental step that I wouldn't want to recommend"" but ""having to downturn services again"" is also something the health minister does not want see happen. ""We must realise we are seeing levels of pressure that we have never seen before,"" he said. ""That's why we're pushing the vaccination programme as much as we can to get people to still come forward to get their first vaccine and their second vaccine and their booster programme."" Mr Swann said the shortage of front-line staff was a result of years of underinvestment in Northern Ireland's health service. Many Northern Ireland hospitals are currently operating over capacity ""As we see that increase in pressure across all our service areas and all our trust areas we are working to mitigate them as best we can,"" he said. ""But we have limited staff to be able to do that, so it really is about working in partnership with the general public."" He added: ""I don't have enough nurses, I don't have enough doctors, I'm on record saying that. ""Unfortunately it's not about producing staff out of nowhere, we can't do that. ""So it's about supporting the current staff that we have, doing the job they are doing."" Swann 'uncomfortable' with vaccine status call Vaccines for over-12s and boosters for over-50s Jenny Nicholson, lead emergency department nurse at the Ulster Hospital, told Good Morning Ulster about the pressure facing front-line healthcare workers. ""We have 76 in our department at the moment and 57 of those patients are waiting on a hospital ward bed. ""Forty-seven of those patients are waiting more than 12 hours and we do have one patient who has been waiting 58 hours. ""This is really exceptional, we don't often have patients waiting that long, but over the last few days we have seen sustained pressure and over the last couple of weeks, it has been sustained pressure now for some time. ""Staff are working extremely hard, they're under a lot of pressure, extreme pressure daily, they're going home exhausted and, yes, we have seen some of our staff in tears. ""Staff are staying on after their shifts to try and help their colleagues on the incoming shifts, they are picking up extra shifts - they're just working above and beyond, doing everything they can and they are exhausted."" Mr Swann said that he would consider again asking the military for medical staff if needs be. ""I'm quite content to ask for them and it is something we currently keep under review,"" he said. ""But it also depends on the Ministry of Defence as well, it's not a standing pool of people that we can utilise all the time, they are there when they are available."" Mr Swann said he expected the booster vaccination programme to begin ""ramping up"" The health minister acknowledged there had been a slow start to the booster vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, but said he expected it to pick up pace. ""I think our vaccine programme and the people working on it actually should be commended for the work they have done with a vaccine that only became available less than 11 months ago,"" he said ""Our booster programme had been slow to start, but when you listen both to community pharmacies and GPs, it's a programme that's well in place, it's a programme that's actually ramping up as well. ""I would encourage people to come forward and not just get their booster vaccine but actually get their first and second doses as well."" Dolores McCormick, associate director at the Royal College of Nursing, said some of the extra money being allocated to the health service should go to boosting staff levels. ""If we're to fix this absolute crisis that we're all facing at this minute in time, it's staff that we need,"" she said ""We can't create staff overnight, we've got over 2,700 nursing vacancies posts across the health and social care system and a similar percentage probably in the nursing home sector. ""We're haemorrhaging staff, some of that money needs to be spent on how we retain that staff.""

Sponsors cut ties with Yorkshire over racism report,"A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq captained Yorkshire in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Nike has become the latest company to cut ties with Yorkshire County Cricket Club as the fallout from the Azeem Rafiq investigation continues. Primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea have also ended deals with the club. Rafiq will give evidence in person to MPs into a report about allegations of racism he made against Yorkshire. The report found Rafiq had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire has said no disciplinary action would be taken. The club had announced a four-year deal with Nike to be its new kit supplier in March this year. But a statement from the company said: ""Nike will no longer be the kit supplier for Yorkshire CCC. ""We stand firmly against racism and discrimination of any kind."" On Thursday, Harrogate Spring Water said it was also ending its club sponsorship agreement with immediate effect. ""We were deeply concerned at the details that have emerged in recent days surrounding the treatment of Azeem Rafiq at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the way in which the club's current leadership have handled the important issues that have been raised,"" a statement said. Furniture manufacturer JT Ellis said it was suspending its sponsorship of the club too. ""As a long-established family business with strong moral values and a diverse workforce, we do not tolerate any form of discriminatory behaviour whatsoever,"" it said. Ballance 'regrets' using racial slur Yorkshire board should resign , says DCMS chair Senior Yorkshire officials have also been called to attend the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing on 16 November. Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton will be questioned by MPs, along with chief executive Mark Arthur and director of cricket Martyn Moxon. Witnesses who give evidence to select committees are protected by parliamentary privilege, which means they are immune from the threat of civil or criminal proceedings relating to what they say. On Wednesday, Emerald Publishing said that, while it was withdrawing its ""brand association"" with Yorkshire, it would continue a financial commitment to Headingley, where the home stadium of rugby league team Leeds Rhinos is also based. Yorkshire Tea ended its affiliation with ""immediate effect"", while leisure club operator David Lloyd said it has chosen not to reinstate its partnership. Tetley's beer said it had informed Yorkshire that its sponsorship would not be extended beyond the end of the current contractual agreement. NIC Services, which sponsors the fronts of Yorkshire's shirts in the County Championship, said it would consider its backing after the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) investigation into Rafiq's allegations and select committee review have been completed. Julian Knight MP has called on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resign after a leaked report emerged apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee, called it ""one of the most repellent and disturbing episodes in modern cricket history"". In a tweet, he added: ""Given the endemic racism at Yorkshire County Cricket Club, I struggle to think of any reason why that the board should remain in post."" YCCC did not comment on any of the allegations when contacted by BBC Sport. Knight's comments came after UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid had called for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said that if the ECB did not take action, ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further stated in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries called Rafiq's treatment ""disgusting"" and said ""the investigation that followed only makes it even worse"". In a tweet, she added that any ECB investigation must be ""swift and fully transparent. Racism must be confronted, and NEVER written off as just 'banter'"". Meanwhile, Yorkshire MPs have called on the ECB to launch an ""immediate, comprehensive and independent inquiry into the racist abuse"". In theletter,external, they said referring to the use of a racially offensive term as ""banter"" was ""truly abhorrent"". ""Azeem Rafiq was not afforded the dignity and respect he deserved, it now falls to the ECB to ensure this degrading incident is not repeated,"" it read. An ECB spokesperson said: ""Last week, we received Yorkshire CCC's report into the racism and bullying allegations Azeem Rafiq made against the club. ''We are conscious about the length of time that Azeem has waited for resolution and the toll that must be taking on his wellbeing and that of his family. We are sorry that, as a sport, this has not yet been resolved. ''We will conduct a full regulatory process that is fair to all parties, but also ensure this happens as quickly as possible. To achieve this, we have secured the services of a QC, along with other external investigatory support to upweight resource around our process. The ECB board has also reaffirmed its commitment to further additional resource, should the investigation require it. ''We are aware that the [DCMS] Select Committee have called Yorkshire's chair, Roger Hutton, to give evidence. In the meantime, we will press ahead with our investigation.'' Last year, Rafiq claimed ""institutional racism"" at the clubleft him close to taking his own life.,external Seven of the 43 allegations wereupheld in a report by an independent panel. Hutton apologised to Rafiq - who had two stints with Yorkshire, the second ending in 2018 - and said there was ""no question"" that during his first spell at the club he had been ""the victim of racial harassment"".

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries called Rafiq's treatment ""disgusting"" and said ""the investigation that followed only makes it even worse"". In a tweet, she added that any ECB investigation must be ""swift and fully transparent. Racism must be confronted, and NEVER written off as just 'banter'"". Meanwhile, Yorkshire MPs have called on the ECB to launch an ""immediate, comprehensive and independent inquiry into the racist abuse"". In theletter,external, they said referring to the use of a racially offensive term as ""banter"" was ""truly abhorrent"". ""Azeem Rafiq was not afforded the dignity and respect he deserved, it now falls to the ECB to ensure this degrading incident is not repeated,"" it read. An ECB spokesperson said: ""Last week, we received Yorkshire CCC's report into the racism and bullying allegations Azeem Rafiq made against the club. ''We are conscious about the length of time that Azeem has waited for resolution and the toll that must be taking on his wellbeing and that of his family. We are sorry that, as a sport, this has not yet been resolved. ''We will conduct a full regulatory process that is fair to all parties, but also ensure this happens as quickly as possible. To achieve this, we have secured the services of a QC, along with other external investigatory support to upweight resource around our process. The ECB board has also reaffirmed its commitment to further additional resource, should the investigation require it. ''We are aware that the [DCMS] Select Committee have called Yorkshire's chair, Roger Hutton, to give evidence. In the meantime, we will press ahead with our investigation.'' Last year, Rafiq claimed ""institutional racism"" at the clubleft him close to taking his own life.,external Seven of the 43 allegations wereupheld in a report by an independent panel.

"Protests like anxiety dream, free speech row prof saysKathleen Stock, who has quit her job, says it was surreal to see her name ""plastered over every wall"".Family & Education","Prof Kathleen Stock says a protest against her was like a medieval experience A university professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity has said protests against her were like a ""terrible anxiety dream"". In a BBC interview, Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she quit her University of Sussex post following ""reputation trashing from colleagues"". She said it had been surreal to see her name ""plastered over every wall"" on student protest posters. The university said it unequivocally defended her right to free speech. Vice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell told staff in an email he had hoped Prof Stock would have felt able to return to work, and she would have been supported. But the philosophy professor told BBC's Woman's Hour the campaign against her was the ""end point"" of years of negative treatment by colleagues that had become ""exhausting"". Prof Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more ""socially significant"" than biological sex,  said her views had been ""radically misrepresented"" to suggest she was bigoted or transphobic, something she categorically denies. But an online statement accompanying the campaign against her suggested Prof Stock ""has spent years campaigning for the exclusion of trans people from 'women's only spaces' and against trans and non-binary people's right to self-identify as any gender"". It also criticised her trusteeship of the LGB Alliance, which describes itself on Twitter as promoting ""the rights of lesbians, bisexuals & gay men, as recognised by biological sex"". The group is described by trans activists as transphobic, which it denies. In the interview aired on Wednesday, Prof Stock said: ""In almost every university... there are a small group of people who are absolutely opposed to the sorts of things I say and instead of getting involved in arguing with me using reason, evidence - the traditional university methods - they tell their students in lectures that I pose a harm to trans students. ""They go on Twitter to say that I'm a bigot so thus creating an atmosphere in which students become much more extreme and much more empowered to do what they did, I guess."" In October,posters were put up near the university campusand an accompanying social media campaign claimed Prof Stock ""makes trans students unsafe"". Photos also showed a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner reading ""Stock out"". Prof Stock told Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett the effect of the protests was ""head spinning"" and ""like some sort of surreal terrible anxiety dream to see your name plastered over every wall"". She described a protest at an open day when about 100 students were holding placards saying ""Stock out"", ''Fire her"", with flares being set off. ""I don't know if I can explain it but you have to imagine yourself at your workplaceâ¦ all eyes are on you, all fingers seem to be pointing at you, it's like a medieval experience,"" she said. ""At that point I wasn't scared so much as incredibly distressed."" The professor said she had received hundreds of letters of support and accused her critics of being ""out of step"" with the public. The ""tipping point"" that led to her resignation, she said, was when the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) released a statement which ""basically backed the protesters and implicitly made it obvious that they thought I was transphobic and accused Sussex University of institutional transphobia"". She had previously tweeted a screenshot of a message purportedly sent to all Sussex UCU members which didn't name her personally but urged university management to ""take a clear and strong stance against transphobia at Sussex"", including an ""urgent investigation"". The national branch of the UCU released a follow-up statement saying it was a ""proud and unequivocal supporter of trans rights"", opposed harassment and bullying and was ""not calling for any staff to be dismissed from their post"". The University of Sussex said it had publicly and internally fully supported Prof Stock's freedom of speech and would not tolerate the bullying and harassment of anyone in its community. Equalities minister Liz Truss and chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Baroness Kishwer Falkner both criticised the attacks on Prof Stock. Higher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said the campaign of harassment against her was ""deplorable"" and the situation should never have got that far.

Ikea to raise prices as supply problems bite,"Ikea is to raise prices as the disruption to global supply chains is expected to last into next year. On Wednesday, Ikea reported a drop in full-year profit due to higher transport and raw material costs. In the coming year it will pass some of these costs on to its outlets, which will be free to then charge customers more, the Reuters news agency reported. Businesses have been struggling with supply chain problems as economies recover from the Covid pandemic. The Swedish furniture giant saw record demand during the pandemic as people spent more time at home. However, pre-tax profit at Ikea Group, which makes most of its money selling goods to its franchisees, fell 16% in the year to September to â¬1.7bn (Â£1.4bn). Compared with 2019, before the pandemic, profit was down 4%. The biggest hit to its income came from ""the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year,""it said,external. ""Keeping Ikea stores and warehouses stocked has been a challenge. Supply chain disruptions led to a substantial drop in the availability of products that we have yet to recover from. We expect this will continue far into [Ikea's 2022 fiscal year],"" it added. Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages Ikea struggles to supply 1,000 product lines Chief Financial Officer, Martin van Dam, said that the effects of the global supply chain crisis and high energy prices could last for some time, saying he expected 2022 to be ""a more difficult year with more challenges"". Ikea didn't hike its product prices to retailers in the year to September but indicated it would pass on some of the higher raw material and transport costs to store owners this fiscal year. ""Though we can't continue to secure fixed prices to the retailers under these challenging conditions, we also plan to absorb part of the increased costs during FY22,"" it said. Mr Van Dam said store owners would have some freedom to decide whether, or to what extent, they would pass on higher prices to shoppers. The Ikea announcement comes after chief executive Jesper Brodin said in mid-October that congestion at ports had led to supply problems. ""We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,"" he said. Ikea has been forced to buy additional shipping capacity to address product shortages.

Payout after mum died following benefit errors,"This video can not be played Philippa Day: Benefits problems 'destroyed Nottingham mum' The family of a mother who died after a series of errors with her benefits has agreed a ""substantial settlement"". Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home with a letter rejecting an assessment in August 2019. An inquest heard the way her claim was dealt with was the ""predominant factor"" in her overdose. The family said the settlement would provide for Miss Day's son, but that nothing can ""put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death"". The exact amount of the settlement has not been disclosed. The inquest heardthe authorities who dealt with Miss Day's benefits claim made 28 errors in managing her case. At one point Miss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, saw her income go down from Â£228 a week to Â£60. The court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was ""starving"" and ""couldn't survive like this for much longer"". There were failings at both the DWP and contractors Capita, the coroner found. Miss Day's sister, Imogen, said: ""Capita's wall of bureaucracy, with no consideration for Philippa's mental state, exacerbated her despair at her debt and poverty. ""She was met with cold, uncaring call operators who would not listen to her cries for help. ""This settlement will in some measure provide for Philippa's family and a materially stable upbringing for Philippa's son, but he has lost his mother, and there is nothing Capita can do to put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death."" Philippa Day (left) took a fatal overdose and died in October 2019 However, the family said they welcomed an offer to meet with Capita to discuss improvements to their service. Merry Varney, from Leigh Day solicitors - who represented the family - said: ""Capita has shown acceptance of their failures and a willingness to ensure their mistakes are not repeated, however there remain too many examples of the DWP, which controls the financial circumstances of the majority of people too sick to work, acting inhumanely to those receiving benefits and a continued resistance by the DWP to transparent investigations into benefit-related deaths. ""Until the DWP changes its attitude, people like Philippa and her family remain at risk of gross human rights violations and 'benefit-related deaths' are just another example of preventable deaths of people with disabilities occurring without any proper investigation or scrutiny."" A Capita spokesperson said: ""We are very sorry for the mistakes we made in processing Philippa's Personal Independence Payment claim and the additional stress this caused her. ""In partnership with the DWP, we have considered and reviewed the coroner's report and we are implementing all the recommendations that are relevant to us. ""Following this incident, we have strengthened our processes and we are working to continuously improve and deliver a professional, efficient and kind service for every PIP applicant we assess."" In response to the regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death (PFD)report stemming from the inquest, the DWP wrote to coroner Gordon Clow and pledged to ensure all of its staff handling PIP and employment and support allowance (ESA) would undertake training in mental health, behaviour and relationships as well as ""supporting vulnerable customers"". Following a Freedom of Information request by the BBC Shared Data Unit, the DWP said all of its 7,000 staff had received the training by the end of June ""other than a small number absent for reasons such as maternity leave and therefore not currently working in the business"". Imogen Day described the training as a ""positive step"", but said she continued to ""have concerns over the culture at DWP, which the coroner referred to as showing a lack of compassion"".

Britney Spears blames mum for conservatorship,"Britney Spears with her mother Lynne in 2002 Britney Spears has said she blames her mother for the conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. The star's father Jamie has been the public face of the legal arrangement that means the pop star has minimal say in her personal and financial affairs. But writing online, the singer claimed it was her mother Lynne's idea. ""What people don't know is that my mom is the one who gave him the idea,"" she said. ""I will never get those years back... she secretly ruined my life."" In the now-deleted Instagram post, she continued: ""You know exactly what you did. My dad is not smart enough to ever think of a conservatorship, but tonight I will smile knowing I have a new life ahead of me."" Spears' post appears to have been prompted by her father requesting the ""immediate"" and ""unconditional"" termination of the conservatorship. The arrangement is a form of legal guardianship normally granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Britney Spears alongside her dad Jamie in 2006 ""Jamie unconditionally loves and supports his daughter. Full stop,"" his lawyers said in court documents obtained by the BBC. ""The fact is that 13 years ago, a conservatorship was necessary to protect Britney in every sense of the word. Her life was in shambles and she was in physical, emotional, mental and financial distress. ""Through the conservatorship, Britney has been able to return to a path towards stability in all of these phases of her life. The mission has been successful and it is now time for Britney to re-take control of her life."" Mr Spears' lawyers said the request came without ""any caveat"" and that he would hand over all documents related to arrangement, adding that he had ""nothing to hide"". In her post on Tuesday, Britney also named her former business manager Lou Taylor as helping to orchestrate the conservatorship. Neither she nor Lynne Spears have responded to the comments. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney criticises family over conservatorship Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Britney Spears has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father to petition a court for legal authority over his daughter's life. The arrangement has come under intense scrutiny, and after years of silence, the singer finally shared her perspective in an explosive 23-minute statement to the Los Angeles Superior Court in June. Labelling the conservatorship ""abusive"", the 39-year-old claimed she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children. ""I just want my life back,"" she told Judge Brenda Penny via phone. THE BATTLE FOR BRITNEY:The truth behind the Britney Spears' conservatorship Her father filed papers to have the conservatorship terminated in September, but did not set a time scale for the transition. Judge Penny temporarily suspended him as conservator of his daughter's estate that month (he had not been in charge of her personal affairs since 2019). The next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 12 November. However, even if the star is released from the arrangement, the legal battle is unlikely to come to a close. The singer's lawyer Mathew Rosengart has accused her father of financial misconduct and ""reaping millions of dollars from his daughter's estate"". In September, he told reporters he had ""serious questions"" about ""potential misconduct, including conflicts of interest, conservatorship abuse and the evident dissipation of Ms Spears fortune"", and vowed a ""top-to-bottom"" examination of documents relating to the case. In court filings this week, Mr Rosengart also accused Mr Spears of trying to avoid answering questions about the alleged surveillance of the singer inside her home. He demanded ""all documents and communications relating to any recording or listening device in the home or bedroom of Britney Jean Spears, including all documents and communications relating to the decision to place any such recording or listening device and the records of any such recording"". Jamie Spears has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, and says he always acted in his daughter's ""best interests"". His own filing suggests he will hand over any documents relating to the case.

Labour Party members' data hit by cyber incident,"The Labour Party has been affected by a ""cyber incident"" involving its members' data. Labour said it was told on 29 October that it had been affected by the event by a third party firm that handled membership data on its behalf. As a result, ""a significant quantity"" of party data was ""rendered inaccessible on their systems"". The Information Commissioner's Office and National Cyber Security Centre are both looking into the incident. In a statement,external, Labour said it was working closely with the two authorities, as well as the National Crime Agency, to find out what had happened. The party also said it was ""working closely and on an urgent basis with the third party in order to understand the full nature, circumstances and impact of the incident"", but that its own data systems were unaffected. Labour has yet to reveal who the third party is, the scale of the incident or what type of data was affected. But it did say the incident involved information provided to the party by its ""members, registered and affiliated supporters, and other individuals who have provided their information"". The Labour Party's statement is vague and leaves a lot of questions for party members. How many users have had their data compromised? What data is at stake? Does it include financial details or other sensitive information? No doubt IT teams will be in full crisis mode trying to assess how bad the hack is. They are also not saying what type of attack it is, but the statement makes it pretty clear that it is likely to be a ransomware attack. Which means, someone, somewhere is demanding a ransom in exchange for safe return of the databases they have taken control of. Like thousands of organisations in the last year, Labour - or rather the company that stores its data - is faced with the horrendous and controversial decision - to pay or not to pay cyber criminals. A spokesman for the NCSC said: ""We are aware of this issue and are working with the Labour Party to fully investigate and mitigate any potential impact. ""We would urge anyone who thinks they may have been the victim of a data breach to be especially vigilant against suspicious emails, phone calls or text messages and to follow the steps set out in our data breaches guidance.""

Wales to get Â£46m of EU funds replacement pilot,"The Heads of the Valleys road is among the projects EU aid funded Wales will get nearly a quarter of a new Â£200m fund set up as a pilot for replacing EU aid. More than 160 projects totalling Â£46m led by Welsh councils will receive packages between Â£1.9m and Â£6,600. Every council in Wales except Flintshire is receiving cash, with projects ranging from training schemes to enhancing Llandudno promenade. But the Labour Welsh government accused Tory ministers of misleading the public over how it would replace EU money. It accused UK ministers of cutting replacement money it was promised. The UK government said that claim was ""incorrect"". Plaid Cymru called for a needs-based funding formula administered by the Welsh government. Wales received Â£375m every year under the old EU arrangements aimed at helping poor regions. The cash is being slowly phased out, with most of it ending next year. Scheme to replace EU cash for poor areas unveiled New UK prosperity fund to bypass Holyrood Â£1m for Creative Industry Training Programme in venues across Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff Â£200,000 to help unemployed and disadvantaged people set up businesses in Carmarthenshire Â£51,000 for enhancing Llandudno promenade Â£6,630 for a bicycle project in Cardiff A full list is atthe UK government website,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said that over time the UK government will match EU funding of Â£1.5bn a year. It is planning a new Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF), expecting to roll out from April 2022, and the Treasury has pledged it will ""at least"" match EU funding for the poorest region. The Â£200m Community Renewal Fund has been launched as a pilot for the SPF, with England receiving Â£123m, Wales Â£46m, Scotland Â£18m and Northern Ireland Â£12m. Wales will get most funding per head, while in England the South West region will receive the largest sum. But the CRF has been criticised for not giving Wales and other devolved governments a say in how it is spent. The Welsh government had administered EU cash, and some of the money is used to fund apprenticeships and the Development Bank for Wales. Ministers have claimed that there could be 5,300 fewer apprenticeship placements supported every year if the money was not fully replaced. However, in turn, the Conservative Welsh secretary has claimed Wales had spent some EU money on""vanity projects"". UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up Michael Gove said:â¯â¯ ""We are determined to unite and level up our whole United Kingdom. ""The projects we are supporting today, from Wrexham to Caerphilly, will help communities across Wales realise their full potential, create new opportunities for the future and help us achieve net zero carbon emissions."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Throughout the Brexit debate, the UK government gave repeated assurances Wales would not lose 'a single penny' of EU funding should the UK exit the EU. ""Today's announcement by the UK government shows they are short-changing Wales by cutting the replacement funding we were promised. ""Instead of Wales receiving at least Â£375m annually in new money to invest from January this year, it confirms Wales will receive just Â£46m. This is not ""levelling up"", it's levelling down. ""It is yet another clear demonstration the people of Wales have been misled by the UK government."" Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts MP said Wales a whole was losing out ""by forcing local authorities to fight among each other for a smaller pot of money"". ""There is still an opportunity for the UK government to match its 'levelling up' rhetoric with action by committing to a needs-based funding formula for the Shared Prosperity Fund, administered by our devolved government in Wales."" A UK government spokesperson said the Welsh government's claims were ""incorrect"". ""The EU structural fund programme will continue until December 2023 and the Â£200mn UK Community Renewal Fund [UKCRF] announced today is in addition to it. ""The UKCRF will help local areas prepare for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund in 2022, the scheme that will see UK-wide funding at least match EU money - reaching around Â£1.5bn a year."" The Welsh government is standing by the figures it has highlighted.

Shortly, we'll be bringing our live coverage of day four of COP26 to a close, but we'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to energy. Helen Briggs We've had a few questions on this theme of what happens if countries donât keep their promises, including from Diana Butungi in Kampala. She wants to know if China and India could be sanctioned if they failed to set a 2050 net-zero target. The deal the world signed up to in Paris is largely based on carrot not stick, when it comes to goals for slashing emissions. Countries set their own emissions targets, which are assessed every five years. The process relies on trust and the sense weâre all in this together â with leaders seen as lagging behind if they donât step up to the mark. But while there are no sanctions for missing emissions targets or not pledging to do enough to keep warming in check, there is talk of shortening the timetable by which countries submit their emissions plans so they come to the table with more ambitious plans sooner than 2025. Wael HusseinBBC News, Cairo Alexandria is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea The city of Alexandria, on Egyptâs Mediterranean coast, has
survived invasions, earthquakes and fires since it was established 2,000 years
ago by Alexander the Great. Now, it's facing a new threat: rising sea levels. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday that Alexandria would be among the low-lying major cities âlost
beneath the wavesâ if global temperatures rose by 4C. In response, Alexandriaâs Governor Mohammed el-Sherif has noted that the city, which is home
to 5 million people, is already suffering from the effects of climate change. Sherif says rainfall has been increasing year after year, causing
huge problems. In 2015, six people were killed when a severe storm flooded
large parts of the city. Authorities have installed concrete sea defences to
reduce the impact of waves, but they cannot stop the water level from rising. Rachel King says she was thrilled to meet US President Joe Biden US President Joe Biden may have ended his flying visit to Scotland for COP26 - but one hotel worker is still ""on cloud nine"" after meeting him. Rachel King works at the Dalmahoy Hotel, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, where the president was staying withhis huge entourage.

The Earthâs gravitational force keeps the gases from leaving our atmosphere. All planets in our solar system have an atmosphere in one form or another, for example, Mars, a smaller planet than Earth,has an atmosphere of less than 1% of the volume of our own atmosphere,external. Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼terLatin America Editor, BBC News One of the tangible achievements to have come out of COP26
has been the expansion of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, announced by Ecuadorâs
president in Glasgow. The waters around the Galapagos Islands teem with endangered
species such as the endangered whale shark. But in recent years, a huge Chinese fishing fleet has been
accused by conservationists of âpillagingâ the waters surrounding the islands. President Lasso tells the BBC that the expansion is not in
response to the movements of the Chinese fleet but rather âto show that action
rather than words were the most effective way to fight climate changeâ. The move has been welcomed as âa brilliant first stepâ by conservationists.
Among them is Sarah Darwin, great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, whose
theory of evolution was inspired by the biodiversity he found on the islands. Sarah Darwin, a botanist and an ambassador for the Galapagos
Conservation Trust says that she hopes that the conservation efforts conducted
in and around the islands would set a wider example. ""If you can save the Galapagos, you can save the
world,"" she says. You can read more about the expansionhere. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Peter Falandysz in County Durham, England, asks if anyone in government is looking at reducing speed limits on motorways to save fuel and cut emission - might it be a quick and relatively easy thing to implement? There are ways to save a bit of fuel â and therefore pollution â by driving more smoothly or slowly, but this is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the huge emissions cuts needed over the course of the decade to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels that power our cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. Transport accounts for about one-fifth of global carbon dioxide emissions, with much of it coming from cars. The governmentâs net-zero strategy relies on a shift towards electric vehicles, among other things. And we will all have to rethink the way we travel in a net-zero world. There have been several protests taking place in Glasgow today, including the one involving the inflatable Nessie that was escorted away by police. Protesters
from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are holding demonstrations in central Glasgow outside the offices of companies they accuse of ""greenwashing"" - paying lip service to climate change but not tackling it. BBC
Scotlandâs James Cheyne says at least two XR protesters were arrested this
afternoon after a demonstration outside power company SSE. Police Scotland says a number of officers were sprayed with paint and two arrests were made. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading On Tuesday we reported on measures to reduce emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Alan Morley-Fletcher from Cornwall in England asks if home composting in your own garden emits harmful methane? And, if so, what can we do to compost in a non-polluting way? Decomposing material only emits methane under anaerobic (zero oxygen) conditions, like in a landfill. A well-managed compost heap decomposes under aerobic conditions, so no methane is released. You can ensure that your compost heap has enough oxygen by balancing green and brown material. TheRoyal Horticultural Society recommends,externalthat 25% to 50% of the material should be soft green waste, with the rest brown material such as leaves, cardboard and woodchip. The inclusion of brown waste as well as turning the heap regularly will ensure that there is enough oxygen for aerobic bacteria to thrive. Remember too that home composting means that the environmental costs of collecting and transporting the waste are avoided, as are the transport costs of bringing compost into your garden. Leading organisations in the world of sport have agreed to reach net zero emissions by 2040 - as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030. All new and existing members of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be called upon to adopt the targets, which were agreed today. The agreement aims to gather sports organisations, teams, athletes, and fans in a concerted effort to raise awareness for the urgency required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa says: ""The sector eagerly took up the challenge, but also told us that they want to do more and to do it faster."" Signatories to the framework,externalinclude the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, Athletics Kenya, BBC Sport, the Premier League, Formula E and Munster Rugby. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow One of the questions we've had is: why can't we ban deforestation sooner? Forests have long been seen as a critical part of the climate solution, but rates of deforestation around the world are still rising, despite international efforts. In 2014, the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it in 2030, but the agreement failed. One of the first deals struck in Glasgow was a new pact on deforestation, signed by more than 100 world leaders, who pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The move was given a cautious welcome by experts, but some said the target of 2030 was disappointing. Part of the problem is that many of the worldâs remaining forests are in countries in the global south where jobs and livelihoods depend on exports such as palm oil, beef and soya. And some people living in the Amazon depend on the forest for their livelihoods and need support in finding new incomes. There are a complex set of problems that need to be solved if the world is to do better at preventing deforestation. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Many readers have asked about the speed of change, including Graeme from Somerset in England, who says: Hasnât Covid proven that people can quickly switch careers if financial support is there?  Canât we just ban deforestation by the end of 2022 rather than by 2030? While the rest of the world still demands exports such as palm oil or beef, there is still more money to be made from clearing forests than protecting them. It is not easy for those who make livelihoods from these exports to find new incomes, nor is it easy to bring in policies and legislation at national and local levels both to stop deforestation and enforce that stop. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of our readers are interested in the agriculture sector and how much difference food choices make.Preeti Singh, in India, asks:What is the direct and indirect impact of meat and dairy consumption on climate change? Beef is by far the worst food you can eat from a climate change perspective. This is because cows produce methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and have large land-use requirements for grazing and feed production. A study by the UNâs Food and Agricultural Organisation in 2013,externalestimated that livestock production as a whole accounted for 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. This estimate takes into account the full life cycle of the supply chain, from land use, feed production, animal production (including methane emissions) and transportation of products. Beef and dairy production is by far the biggest source of emissions in the livestock sector, counting for 8.8% of that 14.5%. The demand for meat is predicted to increase as societies become more affluent and the worldâs population grows.One estimate,externalsuggests that livestock production will grow by 25% between 2015 and 2030. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Bernath Bence in the Netherlands asks if there are plans for governments to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? ""It seems that solutions might exist, but up to now it is financed by private companies."" Carbon capture is a cutting-edge, costly and controversial technology, but some experts believe it will be part of the solution to achieving net zero. So-called nature solutions - such as planting trees and restoring peatlands - take time to reap rewards, and remain vulnerable to logging or wildfires. Some argue they may not be enough in themselves and are calling for a mass rollout of plants to capture carbon dioxide and bury the gases underground. Despite questions over the use of carbon capture, some countries are forging ahead. Efforts are under way in Norway, the Netherlands and the UK to build up networks for capturing greenhouse gases and storing them under the North Sea. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow We've heard about wealthy nations, but what influence do less developed, poorer countries have during the negotiation process? That's a question from Navein in Malaysia. The idea that everyone has a place at the table is central to the negotiations. Poorer nations have been key players in the talks for years. The issue of mutual trust between developed and developing countries is a prevailing theme at Glasgow, with impassioned speeches from leaders of countries facing the biggest devastation from climate change. The run-up to this conference was marred by concerns over access to Covid vaccines and problems caused by travel restrictions. Ensuring everyone feels they have a voice will be central to the success of the talks. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of you have asked what an ordinary person who is not in a position of power can do to help with climate change. Gemma-Kirstie in Hove in England asks: I want to do something but sometimes feel helpless, so my question is: what can each one of us do that will have an impact? While it is commonly quoted that 71% of global emissions are produced by just 100 companies, it is us who consume what these companies produce. For most of us, reducing our air travel and eating less meat are the single biggest changes we can make to reduce our own carbon footprint, but we also need to lobby for change in our society as a whole, for example to make sure that large infrastructure investments are undertaken in ways compatible with our climate goals. We're turning our attention now to your questions about climate change. Answering them are Dr Liz Stephens, an associate professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading, and the BBC's own science correspondent Helen Briggs. We'll also continue to bring you the latest developments from Glasgow. By Daniel Kraemer Rich countries have failed to meet a pledge made over a decade ago to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cope with climate. That target has now been pushed back to 2023, although some remain optimistic it could be reached earlier. The group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) say this delay is unacceptable and that the figure of $100bn falls far short of what these nations need to deal with a crisis not of their own making. Various declarations have been made by rich nations at the climate summit on how they plan meet their goals on climate finance for developing nations. You can read more about climate finance and which of the rich countries are closest to meeting their obligations under the initiative in our piecehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

For most of us, reducing our air travel and eating less meat are the single biggest changes we can make to reduce our own carbon footprint, but we also need to lobby for change in our society as a whole, for example to make sure that large infrastructure investments are undertaken in ways compatible with our climate goals. We're turning our attention now to your questions about climate change. Answering them are Dr Liz Stephens, an associate professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading, and the BBC's own science correspondent Helen Briggs. We'll also continue to bring you the latest developments from Glasgow. By Daniel Kraemer Rich countries have failed to meet a pledge made over a decade ago to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cope with climate. That target has now been pushed back to 2023, although some remain optimistic it could be reached earlier. The group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) say this delay is unacceptable and that the figure of $100bn falls far short of what these nations need to deal with a crisis not of their own making. Various declarations have been made by rich nations at the climate summit on how they plan meet their goals on climate finance for developing nations. You can read more about climate finance and which of the rich countries are closest to meeting their obligations under the initiative in our piecehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Alec Baldwin shares post defending film set safety,"The actor and producer has described the shooting as a ""one-in-a-trillion event"" Alec Baldwin has shared comments from a crew member rejecting suggestions that the set of his film Rust was unsafe. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died last month when the actor fired a gun that he had been told was not loaded. Costume designer Terese Magpale Davis wrote that ""the story being spun of us being overworked and surrounded by unsafe, chaotic conditions"" was untrue. Baldwin, who is also a producer on the film, shared her commentson Instagram,externalwith the caption: ""Read this."" The Hollywood star, 63, accidentally shot Hutchins during rehearsals for the Western in New Mexico last month. Director Joel Souza was injured. A police investigation is under way, with the Santa Fe county sheriff saying there had been ""some complacency"" in how weapons were handled. Other crew members have criticised the safety measures, with chief electrician Serge Svetnoy writing on Facebook that he blamed ""negligence and unprofessionalism"" for the tragedy. It has also emerged that some crew members walked off set before the accident in a dispute over accommodation and hours. Davis said the team had ""several safety meetings, sometimes multiple per day"", and that ""concerns were heard and addressed"". A police investigation is under way into the shooting of Hutchins (pictured in 2018) Accidental discharges are ""more common than you think"", she added. Davis defended the film's weapons expert, armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who handed the gun to assistant director David Halls before he gave it to Baldwin. Rust was Reed's second film in the role. ""How do you suppose anyone will get that experience? We all had a first and second job at one point or another,"" Davis wrote. On Wednesday, Reed's lawyer suggested the incident was an act of ""sabotage"". ""We're afraid that could have been what happened here, that somebody intended to sabotage this set with a live round intentionally placed in a box of dummies,"" Jason Bowles told ABC TV's Good Morning America. ""We're not saying anybody had any intent there was going to be a tragedy of homicide, but they wanted to do something to cause a safety incident on set. That's what we believe happened."" Meanwhile, Davis also refused to criticise Halls, writing: ""Our AD [assistant director] never seemed flippant about safety... I won't jump on the bandwagon and pretend that he was uncaring about our safety the whole way through."" Earlier this week, Halls said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the death of Hutchins. ""It's my hope that this tragedy prompts the industry to re-evaluate its values and practices to ensure no one is harmed through the creative process again,"" he added. Halls had shouted ""cold gun"", indicating it was safe, before handing it to Baldwin,according to court documents. A vigil for Hutchins was held in Albuquerque after the shooting Davis said she would fight for live guns never to be allowed on film sets again in Hutchins's name. She added her voice to dozens of Hollywood's most prominent cinematographers, who have this week called on the industry to ""ban all functional firearms on set"". Greig Fraser (who has worked on Dune), Rachel Morrison (Black Panther), Mandy Walker (Mulan) and Alice Brooks (In the Heights) were among 200 people to have signed a statement. What are the rules for guns on film sets? Baldwin speaks about 'one in a trillion' shooting Vigil held for cinematographer Halyna Hutchins ""We vow to no longer put ourselves and our crew in these unnecessarily lethal situations,"" it read. ""We have safe alternatives in VFX [visual effects] and non-functional firearms. ""We won't wait for the industry to change. We have a duty to effect change within the industry ourselves."" Production on Rust has been halted indefinitely while authorities investigate the shooting. Prosecutors have said it is too early to tell if criminal charges will be brought. Hilaria Baldwin called on photographers to leave her family alone Meanwhile, Baldwin's wife Hilaria hasposted a message on Instagram,externalcondemning the paparazzi for harassing her family since the incident. ""They have not respected our ask to have space, even after the interview we pulled over to do the other day. We have been chased around in cars - with our children. Several scary momentsâ¦ this is dangerous."" The actor spoke publicly about the shooting over the weekend, calling it a ""one-in-a-trillion event"". ""[Hutchins] was my friend,"" he told photographers in Vermont. ""We were a very, very well-oiled crew shooting a film together and then this horrible event happened.""

Two arrested as scuffles break out at COP26 protest,"One protester was carried away by police officers Five activists have been arrested as hundreds of climate change protesters marched through Glasgow. Scuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building. Police said other arrests were made following ""assaults"" on officers who had paint sprayed in their faces. Most of the demonstrations against corporate ""greenwashing"" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers. The biggest protests of the summit so far began with hundreds of campaigners gathering in the city centre to highlight what they see as the exaggeration of green credentials by big businesses. Some then headed for the offices of SSE where police and security staff prevented activists entering the building, and four arrests were made including two people who, according to the police, sprayed paint at officers. Gary Ritchie, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said they received first aid at the scene before opting to return to the operation, which he described as ""very effective"" and ""very well planned"". Follow live coverage of COP26 Private firms could be used to clear Glasgow's bins Biden leaves Scotland hailing COP26 progress Police close road as protesters march near M8 Another protest took place outside the offices of JP Morgan, where a green flare was let off. Extinction Rebellion said about 500 demonstrators were later ""kettled"" at St Vincent Street before being allowed to move off with a heavy police escort towards the city's Broomielaw next to the River Clyde. Amid shouting and pushing, several protesters fell and police medics helped at least one woman who was injured. ACC Ritchie said most protesters had been ""fairly compliant"" with police ""in negotiations"" with the group about their intentions. ""They have told us they would like to proceed to another part of the city and we have agreed to that,"" he said. ""But for public safety reasons we will be escorting the protesters as they make their way to that location."" ACC Ritchie said police would ""protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community"". He added: ""We will provide a proportionate policing response to any protest and violence will not be tolerated. ""Assaults on officers, who put their safety at risk every day to keep the public safe and have adopted a facilitative and rights-based approach to protest, is totally unacceptable."" Eyewitness: Cameron Buttle, BBC Scotland reporter in Glasgow city centre For around two hours hundreds of public order police were chasing a group of protesters around the centre of Glasgow. It was a hugely difficult operation to police; as soon as a street was blocked the protesters disappeared down a lane or backtracked and took a different route. Eventually a group of about 150 were held in a block just off Renfield Street. It was noisy, passionate and occasionally very tense. I did see some scuffles breaking out in front me but it calmed down very quickly. Eventually the police cordon moved slowly through the city taking the group down towards the main conference venue. Some protesters complained about the police operation, saying it was over the top and heavy handed. The police said they feared that main routes were going to be blocked and said the action was proportionate. Campaigners also used the demonstrations to object to the planned Cambo oil field off Shetland,  on  the anniversary of the Queen inaugurating the flow of North Sea oil in 1975. Friends of the Earth Scotland, along with the campaign groups Platform and Stop Cambo, took part in protest events. Activists took part in a Green Rebellion greenwashing protest on Glasgow's Buchanan Street Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said an environmentalreview of the new Cambo oil fieldshould be carried out before extraction begins. The UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has backed the project, saying Cambo is ""priced in"" to the UK government's plans to reduce emissions. Rosemary Harris, of Platform, said there should be no new investment in oil and gas. She said: ""Any new oil and gas production is continuing to support a declining industry. There's a lot of talk about it being important for jobs, but they should be creating pathways for workers outside oil and gas."" Inside the conference hall, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to cut carbon emissions by rewiring the ""entire global financial system"". He said the plan would help persuade firms investing in fossil fuels to instead put their money into green energy and technologies. About 450 of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension companies, which control about Â£100tn, have signed up. More than 100 world leaders were in Glasgow for the first two days of the COP26 summit but most have now left, leaving delegations to continue the negotiations. US President Joe Biden flew out on Tuesday night after a two-day visit. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Oxford Brookes expels students over gang rape claim,"Two students were expelled from Oxford Brookes University following an allegation of gang rape, the BBC can confirm. A third was suspended after an appeal, and a fourth given a less serious punishment. The incident, first revealed in The Times, was reported to the university in February 2018. The university said it issued ""appropriate penalties"". The alleged victim was a 19-year-old student who claimed she did not consent to sex with any of the four students,according to the Times.,external A police investigation was carried out ""over a period of several months"" in 2018, a spokesman for Thames Valley Police told the BBC. However, it was ""decided that there was insufficient evidence to progress the case further"". The spokesman added that any new information relating to the investigation should be reported to the force. The Times reported that a separate investigation by the university resulted in two of the students being expelled. A third student's punishment was reduced - following an appeal - from expulsion to a term's suspension, and an order to write an apology letter to the alleged victim. A fourth was not found to have breached university regulations and was given a written warning, the paper added. Questions have been raised over the university's admissions policy, after it was reported that one of the students had been under investigation for sexual offences at a US university. Oxford Brookes was one of dozens of universities mentioned on the Everyone's Invited website The university said in a statement that sexual violence and harassment had ""no place at Oxford Brookes"". It said the incident was ""thoroughly investigated"" and that the university had liaised with the police. ""Appropriate penalties, including the most severe penalties available to the University in relation to some of the students, were applied and were upheld on appeal,"" it said. It said it recognised the ""very distressing nature of the allegations"" and that specialist support services had helped ""those most closely affected"". ""As part of our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and respectful culture, we are reviewing behaviour and practices within Brookes Sport, including all clubs, to ensure that policies and practices promote the culture, behaviours and values we expect of all our students,"" it added. Oxford Brookes was one of dozens of universities mentioned on theEveryone's Invited website, which made headlines in March after thousands of victims shared experiences of sexual assault and rape at schools and universities in the UK. At the time,the university said,externalit was ""very concerned"" by accounts of ""traumatic experiences"" at Oxford Brookes, and encouraged students to report incidents. Around the same time,a group of Oxford Brookes students campaignedfor better lighting in parts of the city, after Sarah Everard's murder sparked a debate over women's safety.

Staff gaps see UK meat sent to EU for butchering,"Pork producers are set to begin sending pigs to the Netherlands for butchering and packing. UK meat producers have started sending carcasses to the EU for butchering before re-importing them as they continue to combat a labour shortage. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) say producers are sending beef to the Republic of Ireland amid local shortages of butchers. Meanwhile, pork producers are set to begin sending pigs to the Netherlands for butchering and packing. Meat exported in this way cannot be labelled as British pork for UK sale. According to the BMPA, the move will cost an additional Â£1,500 for each lorry load of carcasses. This includes transport fees, as well as Brexit customs requirements, such as an export health certificate for each consignment. Meat exported from the UK currently undergoes checks in the EU, however, the introduction of post-Brexit import controls on food and animals products in the UK has been delayed until July 2022. ""It is what needs to be done to counteract the problem,"" a spokesperson for BMPA told the BBC. Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU PM not taking pig cull threat seriously, says vet Abattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets The move -which was first reported by the Financial Times,external- comes after post-Brexit staff shortages, and a lack of capacity at abattoirs, have led to the culling of more than 10,000 healthy pigs so far. A shortage of skilled workers, as well as exporting issues, Covid-19, and reduced demand from China, has left the sector with a growing backlog of pork, of which the UK is a significant exporter. Staffing levels are reported to be at least 15% below the normal level. The BMPA said: ""Immigration rules need to be relaxed so we can get experienced people without having to train them to help solve the immediate short-term problem. ""Then we need to be attracting, recruiting, and training people in the UK. This is not an instant fix, however, as we are looking at 18 months or longer to train these people. ""The government also needs to add key level courses to the support they have already given. As far as we can see there are no food related courses, or they are not the ones we need."" Meanwhile, National Farmers Union vice president Tom Bradshaw said: ""Farm businesses have done all they can to recruit staff domestically, but even increasingly competitive wages have had little impact because the labour pool is so limited."" ""A short term Covid Recovery Visa, alongside a permanent Seasonal Workers Scheme, would be an effective and, frankly, vital route to help the pressing needs of the industry today. It would also give us time to invest in the skills and recruitment of our domestic workforce."" Last month, the UK governmentagreed to issue 800 temporary visas for skilled overseas butchersto work in Britain for six months. However, farmers and meat processors, who are waiting for them to arrive, do not expect them before the end of November. Nick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA said: ""We have been saying we are between 10,000 and 12,000 short of these types of workers, 800 doesn't go very far, it has been made very clear it is only for six months and they go again."" The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) refused to comment on the number of applications they had received so far. The government also pledged to fund cold storage for carcasses, while the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has launched a cull and render scheme, dedicating a plant to the disposal of animals. But farmers have criticised the move as not being enough, or not providing a long-term solution, raising concerns about the supply of a number of popular Christmas food products such as pigs in blankets. ""We are in limbo,"" Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association, said. ""Some processors are saying they won't come until mid-December, and some are worried some won't come at all as it is just before Christmas."" ""Butchers are the most meaningful thing we can have. If we get them on the floor we will start moving more pigs."" She told the BBC: ""Sadly this whole situation could have been avoided if the government had acted sooner. While the package of measures announced in October was very welcome, we have yet to see any benefit and even if the measures operate as intended, it will be some time before any meaningful impact is seen on farms. ""For many this will come too late.""

Fishmongers' Hall coroner raises causes of concern,"University of Cambridge graduates Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were unlawfully killed by Usman Khan A coroner has said it was ""very unsatisfactory"" that information the Fishmongers' Hall attacker was likely to carry out an assault was not shared. Convicted terrorist Usman Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at the London venue in November 2019. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, who acted as the inquest coroner, has made 22 recommendations in his prevention of death report. He urged the security services to work more closely with other agencies. He said the case gave ""cause for concern that counter-terrorism police may be in possession of intelligence or information which may be useful to the management of an offender"" by the public protection panel, MAPPA, ""but that such intelligence or information may not be brought to the knowledge of, or taken into account by, MAPPA agencies"". Police and MI5 failure a factor in terror killings Could Fishmongers' Hall attacker have been stopped? How the Fishmongers' Hall attack unfolded The inquests earlier this year found failings by the police, the Probation Service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of Mr Merritt, 25, and 23-year-old Ms Jones. The inquest jury concluded that both were unlawfully killed. Khan, 28, from Staffordshire, was chased from Fishmongers' Hall on to London Bridge by three men, before being shot at 20 times by armed police. Judge Lucraft QC said the Home Office and Ministry of Justice needed to consider how intelligence known only to the Security Service MI5 could be taken into account by the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) system. Usman Khan was shot at 20 times on London Bridge In his report he said: ""A very unsatisfactory situation arose whereby there was a strand of intelligence received shortly prior to Usman Khan's release from prison that he intended to carry out an attack but the MAPPA panel participants were in the main entirely ignorant of that intelligence. ""This case gives cause for concern that counter-terrorism police may be in possession of intelligence or information which may be useful to the management of an offender by the MAPPA panel, but that such intelligence or information may not be brought to the knowledge of or taken into account by MAPPA agencies. ""This issue should be addressed, preferably by ensuring that a single police officer from any covert investigation is responsible and accountable for ensuring that intelligence and information is properly shared and taken into account."" Judge Lucraft also recommended that when decisions were made to vary the licence conditions of an offender this should be properly recorded by the probation officer and the MAPPA panel. Three men chased Khan on to the bridge before armed police arrived In the case of Khan, he was not allowed to go to railway stations but he was given specific permission to travel to London alone on a train to attend the prisoner education event where he carried out his attack. Jurors at the inquests for Mr Merritt and Ms Jones found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan. They concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring him. Deficiencies in the organisation of the event at Fishmongers' Hall, including inadequate security measures, were also found to have been a factor in the deaths.

"Britney Spears blames mum for conservatorshipThe star claims the legal arrangement was her mother's idea, and ""she secretly ruined my life"".Entertainment & Arts","Britney Spears with her mother Lynne in 2002 Britney Spears has said she blames her mother for the conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. The star's father Jamie has been the public face of the legal arrangement that means the pop star has minimal say in her personal and financial affairs. But writing online, the singer claimed it was her mother Lynne's idea. ""What people don't know is that my mom is the one who gave him the idea,"" she said. ""I will never get those years back... she secretly ruined my life."" In the now-deleted Instagram post, she continued: ""You know exactly what you did. My dad is not smart enough to ever think of a conservatorship, but tonight I will smile knowing I have a new life ahead of me."" Spears' post appears to have been prompted by her father requesting the ""immediate"" and ""unconditional"" termination of the conservatorship. The arrangement is a form of legal guardianship normally granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Britney Spears alongside her dad Jamie in 2006 ""Jamie unconditionally loves and supports his daughter. Full stop,"" his lawyers said in court documents obtained by the BBC. ""The fact is that 13 years ago, a conservatorship was necessary to protect Britney in every sense of the word. Her life was in shambles and she was in physical, emotional, mental and financial distress. ""Through the conservatorship, Britney has been able to return to a path towards stability in all of these phases of her life. The mission has been successful and it is now time for Britney to re-take control of her life."" Mr Spears' lawyers said the request came without ""any caveat"" and that he would hand over all documents related to arrangement, adding that he had ""nothing to hide"". In her post on Tuesday, Britney also named her former business manager Lou Taylor as helping to orchestrate the conservatorship. Neither she nor Lynne Spears have responded to the comments. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney criticises family over conservatorship Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Britney Spears has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father to petition a court for legal authority over his daughter's life. The arrangement has come under intense scrutiny, and after years of silence, the singer finally shared her perspective in an explosive 23-minute statement to the Los Angeles Superior Court in June. Labelling the conservatorship ""abusive"", the 39-year-old claimed she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children. ""I just want my life back,"" she told Judge Brenda Penny via phone. THE BATTLE FOR BRITNEY:The truth behind the Britney Spears' conservatorship Her father filed papers to have the conservatorship terminated in September, but did not set a time scale for the transition. Judge Penny temporarily suspended him as conservator of his daughter's estate that month (he had not been in charge of her personal affairs since 2019). The next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 12 November. However, even if the star is released from the arrangement, the legal battle is unlikely to come to a close. The singer's lawyer Mathew Rosengart has accused her father of financial misconduct and ""reaping millions of dollars from his daughter's estate"". In September, he told reporters he had ""serious questions"" about ""potential misconduct, including conflicts of interest, conservatorship abuse and the evident dissipation of Ms Spears fortune"", and vowed a ""top-to-bottom"" examination of documents relating to the case. In court filings this week, Mr Rosengart also accused Mr Spears of trying to avoid answering questions about the alleged surveillance of the singer inside her home. He demanded ""all documents and communications relating to any recording or listening device in the home or bedroom of Britney Jean Spears, including all documents and communications relating to the decision to place any such recording or listening device and the records of any such recording"". Jamie Spears has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, and says he always acted in his daughter's ""best interests"". His own filing suggests he will hand over any documents relating to the case.

Gamer loses work because of her Squid Game name,"A gamer who shares her online name with Netflix smash hit Squid Game says she is losing work because of it. Lydia Ellery, 32, said companies are now hesitant to employ her because of her handle and her perceived association with the show, despite the fact she has been known as Squid Game for more than a decade. She said she has also been subjected to online abuse by fans of the show. As a result, the Twitch streamer is considering changing her name. ""I've received a lot of hate from the fans and I've been turned down for work because of it [the name],"" she told the BBC. Lydia, who is from London but lives in Bristol, has been on social media platforms like game streaming site Twitch and Instagram as Squid Game for 11 years, and as SquidGaming on Twitter. She has 42,300 followers on Twitch and is also part of Yogscast, a collective with more than seven million YouTube subscribers. ""For me it was just a silly name I thought up on the spot,"" she said. ""My friends called me squid because it rhymes with lid, and my name is Lydia."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Korean TV series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation. The Netflix show was watched by 142 million households around the world in its first four weeks, and Lydia has been hit with a wave of attention. ""Because the show doesn't have an official Instagram account, I was flooded with people tagging me or sending me messages thinking I was the show,"" she said.

Lydia said some of the messages have been hateful, which has made her feel stressed. ""I started getting abusive messages from people. People were getting angry with me because they were mega fans... and thought I took the account from the show. ""I had to turn off notifications on my Instagram because it was just constant. My phone has been flooded."" Lydia's accounts have been so popular that she's been kicked out of them several times and been asked to reset her password. ""People were reporting my account and endless people have tried to hack into my account, I keep getting emails from people trying to log in. It's been really frustrating,"" she said. Lydia said that coupled with the loss of income and association with the TV series, she is considering changing her name - and the brand she's built up for more than a decade. ""My SEO [search engine optimisation] is completely messed up now,"" she said. ""If you search for me and my brand which I've had for over 10 years... all you get is the TV show. More recently I've been turned down for work because of my handle. ""I guess it's the connotations of the show - it's a very violent show, maybe it's that?"" In addition to her live-streaming, Lydia does some presenting and advertising work - which has suffered. ""The companies who were giving me this recent role specifically told me I didn't get the work because of my Squid Game handle,"" she said. And while she doesn't want to change her name, she isn't sure if she has a choice. ""I feel down about the whole situation and incredibly fed up,"" she said.

UK firms forced to show how they will hit net zero,"Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules. By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target. An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise. And although the plans will need to be published, the government said ""the aim is to increase transparency and accountability"" and the UK was not ""making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory"". The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the ""first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre"". He said the changes would mean: ""Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards."" In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (Â£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. What does net zero mean? Green investing: How your savings can fight climate change However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were ""doomed to fail"". ""Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. ""However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,"" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still ""pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects."" Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear. ""None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,"" he said. Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. ""Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,"" he said. However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (Â£95trn) of private capital ""is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero"". In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. Can COP26 really save the planet? What's the climate impact of private jets at COP26? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures? Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023. The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there. A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based ""gold standard"" for the plans in order to guard against so-called ""greenwashing"" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance. However, the government said there was ""not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like,external"". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (Â£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying ""transparency was critical"". She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry ""to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers"". But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were ""real business opportunities"" in ""adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices"". Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a ""valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation"". ""It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,"" she added. And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would ""spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business"". Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

Shock win for Republican in Virginia governor vote,"Glenn Youngkin celebrated on stage with his family in Chantilly, Virginia Republican Glenn Youngkin has been elected as Virginia's next governor in a major upset, with his Democratic opponent conceding the race. The ballot has been widely seen as a referendum on Joe Biden's presidency, and defeat will unnerve the Democrats. He won by 10 points in Virginia in the presidential election just a year ago. But rising inflation, a slow economic recovery, a deadlocked legislative agenda and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan have hit his popularity. In a speech to cheering supporters, Mr Youngkin promised to get to work straight away to transform the state. ""We work in real people time, not government time,"" the Republican declared. Key takeaways from a bad night for Joe Biden Mr McAuliffe served as governor from 2014-18. His opinion poll lead vanished in recent weeks, and in a statement after his losssaid he had ""come up short"",externalbut insisted the state remained on a path towards ""inclusion, openness and tolerance for all"". The state's current, Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, was unable to stand for re-election as Virginia does not allow governors to serve consecutive terms in office. In more potential good news for Virginia Republicans, their candidate, former US Marine Winsome Sears, is tipped to become the first black female lieutenant governor of the state, which was the former seat of the pro-slavery Confederacy during the American Civil War. Winsome Sears is a former US Marine The Republican candidate for Virginia attorney general, Cuban American Jason Miyares, was also leading that vote count. And Republicans seemed to be closing in on control of the state's House of Delegates. In other elections across the US on Tuesday: In New Jersey,Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli is neck and neck with Democratic Governor Phil Murphy,external Amid surging crime,Minneapolis voters rejected a proposalto replace the city's police department with a new Department of Public Safety, more than a year after the murder of George Floyd by an officer As expected, Democrat Eric Adams won New York City's mayoral election to replace his party colleague Bill de Blasio; Republican challenger Curtis Sliwa was involved in an argument at his polling station after turning up to vote with a pet cat and being told his furry friend Gizmo could not enter Pittsburgh picked its first black mayor, Democrat Ed Gainey In New York, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa turned up to vote with his cat Gizmo In Boston, Asian-American candidate Michelle Wu was elected mayor, becoming the first woman and first person of colour to take the post. ""One of my sons asked me the other night if boys can be elected mayor of Boston,"" the Democrat told supporters. ""They have been, and they will again some day, but not tonight."" This video can not be played Watch: Diverse candidates elected across US Mr Youngkin is the first member of his party elected to statewide office in Virginia since 2009. The political newcomer focused during the bitterly fought election on crime and the economy, as well as how schools handle race, gender and mask mandates. Mr McAuliffe campaigned on other cultural issues, such as abortion rights and voting reform. But the Democrat's critics hammered him for saying during a debate: ""I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach."" Terry McAuliffe tried to liken his challenger to Donald Trump According to exit polls by the BBC's US partner, CBS, education and the school curriculum were top issues for slightly more than half of all voters. At a news conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Biden predicted his party would win the first major election since he took office 10 months ago, but he acknowledged ""the off-year is always unpredictable"". How Virginia's governor race explains US politics The Democratic president's approval rating has fallen to 43%, according to an opinion poll average by RealClearPolitics. The McAuliffe campaign tried to liken the challenger to former President Donald Trump, who remains unpopular in Virginia. But Mr Youngkin, a mild-mannered private equity tycoon, sought to appeal to moderates by keeping Mr Trump at arm's length, while tapping into the former president's supporters in the state. His balancing act may offer a template for Republicans seeking to win back suburban moderate voters who were turned off by Mr Trump's firebrand style of politics. The race could shape party messaging and battle-plans for next year's mid-term elections, when the Democrats will defend their wafer-thin majorities in Congress, and the 2024 White House election. Mr Trump thanked his supporters for ""coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin"", saying the MAGA movement was ""bigger and stronger than ever before"". By Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Fairfax, Virginia The restaurant was crowded, with people angling for the best place to watch election returns on big screens, with American flags everywhere. They had gathered hoping to see Glenn Youngkin win. Over the past several months, he has charted a course for conservatives - he talks frequently about race relations, and has denounced the teaching of critical race theory. He ran on a law-and-order platform, and opposed mask mandates, and his messaging echoed the kind that Mr Trump uses. But Mr Youngkin kept his distance from the former president. In this way, Mr Youngkin has appealed to voters who like Mr Trump's positions, but are uneasy about the man himself. His win is likely to guide other conservatives in their campaigns for the congressional midterms.

Tackling climate change: how will the world pay for it?,"On day four of the climate summit, the focus turns to how the world finances the transition to green economies World leaders have left Glasgow with some important deals agreed but many difficult issues remain on the negotiating table Developing countries are angry that $100bn in promised annual climate finance is yet to materialise They say that those with the most historical responsibility for climate change should pay for efforts to tackle it and adapt to its effects UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promises to accelerate that finance and says the global financial system is being rewired for net zero COP26's overarching goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of day four of the COP26 climate conference. We'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to the energy industry. Here's a reminder of the day's developments:  Today's live page was written by George Bowden, Paul McLaren and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay, Claudia Allen and Kevin Ponniah. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Expectations for this COP26 conference were low. Governments are still far, far from achieving their goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. We've already got dangerous warming in the form of floods, record heatwaves and wildfires, with a rise of just 1.1C. So you could be forgiven for thinking it's all bad news. But seasoned COP observers have been pleasantly surprised by a slew of announcements that suggest the world is on an unstoppable path to a low-carbon future. So far so good, then. But there have been disappointments. It had been expected that China would improve its offer to peak emissions by 2030. At least a token gesture was anticipated, but it's brought nothing. The only consolation for the COP is that China usually over-delivers on its promises - unlike some others. Read Roger's full analysis here. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions - and thanks to Dr Liz Stephens and Helen Briggs for answering today's selection. If you have comments or questions you can contact us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk- remember to mention climate in your email subject. Shortly, we'll be bringing our live coverage of day four of COP26 to a close, but we'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to energy. Helen Briggs We've had a few questions on this theme of what happens if countries donât keep their promises, including from Diana Butungi in Kampala. She wants to know if China and India could be sanctioned if they failed to set a 2050 net-zero target. The deal the world signed up to in Paris is largely based on carrot not stick, when it comes to goals for slashing emissions. Countries set their own emissions targets, which are assessed every five years. The process relies on trust and the sense weâre all in this together â with leaders seen as lagging behind if they donât step up to the mark. But while there are no sanctions for missing emissions targets or not pledging to do enough to keep warming in check, there is talk of shortening the timetable by which countries submit their emissions plans so they come to the table with more ambitious plans sooner than 2025. Wael HusseinBBC News, Cairo Alexandria is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea The city of Alexandria, on Egyptâs Mediterranean coast, has
survived invasions, earthquakes and fires since it was established 2,000 years
ago by Alexander the Great. Now, it's facing a new threat: rising sea levels. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday that Alexandria would be among the low-lying major cities âlost
beneath the wavesâ if global temperatures rose by 4C. In response, Alexandriaâs Governor Mohammed el-Sherif has noted that the city, which is home
to 5 million people, is already suffering from the effects of climate change. Sherif says rainfall has been increasing year after year, causing
huge problems. In 2015, six people were killed when a severe storm flooded
large parts of the city. Authorities have installed concrete sea defences to
reduce the impact of waves, but they cannot stop the water level from rising.

The Earthâs gravitational force keeps the gases from leaving our atmosphere. All planets in our solar system have an atmosphere in one form or another, for example, Mars, a smaller planet than Earth,has an atmosphere of less than 1% of the volume of our own atmosphere,external. Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼terLatin America Editor, BBC News One of the tangible achievements to have come out of COP26
has been the expansion of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, announced by Ecuadorâs
president in Glasgow. The waters around the Galapagos Islands teem with endangered
species such as the endangered whale shark. But in recent years, a huge Chinese fishing fleet has been
accused by conservationists of âpillagingâ the waters surrounding the islands. President Lasso tells the BBC that the expansion is not in
response to the movements of the Chinese fleet but rather âto show that action
rather than words were the most effective way to fight climate changeâ. The move has been welcomed as âa brilliant first stepâ by conservationists.
Among them is Sarah Darwin, great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, whose
theory of evolution was inspired by the biodiversity he found on the islands. Sarah Darwin, a botanist and an ambassador for the Galapagos
Conservation Trust says that she hopes that the conservation efforts conducted
in and around the islands would set a wider example. ""If you can save the Galapagos, you can save the
world,"" she says. You can read more about the expansionhere. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Peter Falandysz in County Durham, England, asks if anyone in government is looking at reducing speed limits on motorways to save fuel and cut emission - might it be a quick and relatively easy thing to implement? There are ways to save a bit of fuel â and therefore pollution â by driving more smoothly or slowly, but this is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the huge emissions cuts needed over the course of the decade to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels that power our cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. Transport accounts for about one-fifth of global carbon dioxide emissions, with much of it coming from cars. The governmentâs net-zero strategy relies on a shift towards electric vehicles, among other things. And we will all have to rethink the way we travel in a net-zero world. There have been several protests taking place in Glasgow today, including the one involving the inflatable Nessie that was escorted away by police. Protesters
from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are holding demonstrations in central Glasgow outside the offices of companies they accuse of ""greenwashing"" - paying lip service to climate change but not tackling it. BBC
Scotlandâs James Cheyne says at least two XR protesters were arrested this
afternoon after a demonstration outside power company SSE. Police Scotland says a number of officers were sprayed with paint and two arrests were made. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading On Tuesday we reported on measures to reduce emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Alan Morley-Fletcher from Cornwall in England asks if home composting in your own garden emits harmful methane? And, if so, what can we do to compost in a non-polluting way? Decomposing material only emits methane under anaerobic (zero oxygen) conditions, like in a landfill. A well-managed compost heap decomposes under aerobic conditions, so no methane is released. You can ensure that your compost heap has enough oxygen by balancing green and brown material. TheRoyal Horticultural Society recommends,externalthat 25% to 50% of the material should be soft green waste, with the rest brown material such as leaves, cardboard and woodchip. The inclusion of brown waste as well as turning the heap regularly will ensure that there is enough oxygen for aerobic bacteria to thrive. Remember too that home composting means that the environmental costs of collecting and transporting the waste are avoided, as are the transport costs of bringing compost into your garden. Leading organisations in the world of sport have agreed to reach net zero emissions by 2040 - as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030. All new and existing members of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be called upon to adopt the targets, which were agreed today. The agreement aims to gather sports organisations, teams, athletes, and fans in a concerted effort to raise awareness for the urgency required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa says: ""The sector eagerly took up the challenge, but also told us that they want to do more and to do it faster."" Signatories to the framework,externalinclude the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, Athletics Kenya, BBC Sport, the Premier League, Formula E and Munster Rugby. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow One of the questions we've had is: why can't we ban deforestation sooner? Forests have long been seen as a critical part of the climate solution, but rates of deforestation around the world are still rising, despite international efforts. In 2014, the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it in 2030, but the agreement failed. One of the first deals struck in Glasgow was a new pact on deforestation, signed by more than 100 world leaders, who pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The move was given a cautious welcome by experts, but some said the target of 2030 was disappointing. Part of the problem is that many of the worldâs remaining forests are in countries in the global south where jobs and livelihoods depend on exports such as palm oil, beef and soya. And some people living in the Amazon depend on the forest for their livelihoods and need support in finding new incomes. There are a complex set of problems that need to be solved if the world is to do better at preventing deforestation. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Many readers have asked about the speed of change, including Graeme from Somerset in England, who says: Hasnât Covid proven that people can quickly switch careers if financial support is there?  Canât we just ban deforestation by the end of 2022 rather than by 2030? While the rest of the world still demands exports such as palm oil or beef, there is still more money to be made from clearing forests than protecting them. It is not easy for those who make livelihoods from these exports to find new incomes, nor is it easy to bring in policies and legislation at national and local levels both to stop deforestation and enforce that stop. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of our readers are interested in the agriculture sector and how much difference food choices make.Preeti Singh, in India, asks:What is the direct and indirect impact of meat and dairy consumption on climate change? Beef is by far the worst food you can eat from a climate change perspective. This is because cows produce methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and have large land-use requirements for grazing and feed production. A study by the UNâs Food and Agricultural Organisation in 2013,externalestimated that livestock production as a whole accounted for 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. This estimate takes into account the full life cycle of the supply chain, from land use, feed production, animal production (including methane emissions) and transportation of products. Beef and dairy production is by far the biggest source of emissions in the livestock sector, counting for 8.8% of that 14.5%. The demand for meat is predicted to increase as societies become more affluent and the worldâs population grows.One estimate,externalsuggests that livestock production will grow by 25% between 2015 and 2030. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Bernath Bence in the Netherlands asks if there are plans for governments to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? ""It seems that solutions might exist, but up to now it is financed by private companies."" Carbon capture is a cutting-edge, costly and controversial technology, but some experts believe it will be part of the solution to achieving net zero. So-called nature solutions - such as planting trees and restoring peatlands - take time to reap rewards, and remain vulnerable to logging or wildfires. Some argue they may not be enough in themselves and are calling for a mass rollout of plants to capture carbon dioxide and bury the gases underground. Despite questions over the use of carbon capture, some countries are forging ahead. Efforts are under way in Norway, the Netherlands and the UK to build up networks for capturing greenhouse gases and storing them under the North Sea. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow We've heard about wealthy nations, but what influence do less developed, poorer countries have during the negotiation process? That's a question from Navein in Malaysia. The idea that everyone has a place at the table is central to the negotiations. Poorer nations have been key players in the talks for years. The issue of mutual trust between developed and developing countries is a prevailing theme at Glasgow, with impassioned speeches from leaders of countries facing the biggest devastation from climate change. The run-up to this conference was marred by concerns over access to Covid vaccines and problems caused by travel restrictions. Ensuring everyone feels they have a voice will be central to the success of the talks. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of you have asked what an ordinary person who is not in a position of power can do to help with climate change. Gemma-Kirstie in Hove in England asks: I want to do something but sometimes feel helpless, so my question is: what can each one of us do that will have an impact? While it is commonly quoted that 71% of global emissions are produced by just 100 companies, it is us who consume what these companies produce. For most of us, reducing our air travel and eating less meat are the single biggest changes we can make to reduce our own carbon footprint, but we also need to lobby for change in our society as a whole, for example to make sure that large infrastructure investments are undertaken in ways compatible with our climate goals. We're turning our attention now to your questions about climate change. Answering them are Dr Liz Stephens, an associate professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading, and the BBC's own science correspondent Helen Briggs. We'll also continue to bring you the latest developments from Glasgow. By Daniel Kraemer Rich countries have failed to meet a pledge made over a decade ago to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cope with climate. That target has now been pushed back to 2023, although some remain optimistic it could be reached earlier. The group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) say this delay is unacceptable and that the figure of $100bn falls far short of what these nations need to deal with a crisis not of their own making. Various declarations have been made by rich nations at the climate summit on how they plan meet their goals on climate finance for developing nations.

Payout after mum died following benefit errorsAn inquest found 28 errors were made in the case of a mother who took an overdose.Nottingham,"This video can not be played Philippa Day: Benefits problems 'destroyed Nottingham mum' The family of a mother who died after a series of errors with her benefits has agreed a ""substantial settlement"". Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home with a letter rejecting an assessment in August 2019. An inquest heard the way her claim was dealt with was the ""predominant factor"" in her overdose. The family said the settlement would provide for Miss Day's son, but that nothing can ""put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death"". The exact amount of the settlement has not been disclosed. The inquest heardthe authorities who dealt with Miss Day's benefits claim made 28 errors in managing her case. At one point Miss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, saw her income go down from Â£228 a week to Â£60. The court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was ""starving"" and ""couldn't survive like this for much longer"". There were failings at both the DWP and contractors Capita, the coroner found. Miss Day's sister, Imogen, said: ""Capita's wall of bureaucracy, with no consideration for Philippa's mental state, exacerbated her despair at her debt and poverty. ""She was met with cold, uncaring call operators who would not listen to her cries for help. ""This settlement will in some measure provide for Philippa's family and a materially stable upbringing for Philippa's son, but he has lost his mother, and there is nothing Capita can do to put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death."" Philippa Day (left) took a fatal overdose and died in October 2019 However, the family said they welcomed an offer to meet with Capita to discuss improvements to their service. Merry Varney, from Leigh Day solicitors - who represented the family - said: ""Capita has shown acceptance of their failures and a willingness to ensure their mistakes are not repeated, however there remain too many examples of the DWP, which controls the financial circumstances of the majority of people too sick to work, acting inhumanely to those receiving benefits and a continued resistance by the DWP to transparent investigations into benefit-related deaths. ""Until the DWP changes its attitude, people like Philippa and her family remain at risk of gross human rights violations and 'benefit-related deaths' are just another example of preventable deaths of people with disabilities occurring without any proper investigation or scrutiny."" A Capita spokesperson said: ""We are very sorry for the mistakes we made in processing Philippa's Personal Independence Payment claim and the additional stress this caused her. ""In partnership with the DWP, we have considered and reviewed the coroner's report and we are implementing all the recommendations that are relevant to us. ""Following this incident, we have strengthened our processes and we are working to continuously improve and deliver a professional, efficient and kind service for every PIP applicant we assess."" In response to the regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death (PFD)report stemming from the inquest, the DWP wrote to coroner Gordon Clow and pledged to ensure all of its staff handling PIP and employment and support allowance (ESA) would undertake training in mental health, behaviour and relationships as well as ""supporting vulnerable customers"". Following a Freedom of Information request by the BBC Shared Data Unit, the DWP said all of its 7,000 staff had received the training by the end of June ""other than a small number absent for reasons such as maternity leave and therefore not currently working in the business"". Imogen Day described the training as a ""positive step"", but said she continued to ""have concerns over the culture at DWP, which the coroner referred to as showing a lack of compassion"".

"Gamer loses work because of her Squid Game nameThe Twitch streamer, whose online handle is the same as the Netflix show's name, has received online abuse.Technology","A gamer who shares her online name with Netflix smash hit Squid Game says she is losing work because of it. Lydia Ellery, 32, said companies are now hesitant to employ her because of her handle and her perceived association with the show, despite the fact she has been known as Squid Game for more than a decade. She said she has also been subjected to online abuse by fans of the show. As a result, the Twitch streamer is considering changing her name. ""I've received a lot of hate from the fans and I've been turned down for work because of it [the name],"" she told the BBC. Lydia, who is from London but lives in Bristol, has been on social media platforms like game streaming site Twitch and Instagram as Squid Game for 11 years, and as SquidGaming on Twitter. She has 42,300 followers on Twitch and is also part of Yogscast, a collective with more than seven million YouTube subscribers. ""For me it was just a silly name I thought up on the spot,"" she said. ""My friends called me squid because it rhymes with lid, and my name is Lydia."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Korean TV series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation. The Netflix show was watched by 142 million households around the world in its first four weeks, and Lydia has been hit with a wave of attention. ""Because the show doesn't have an official Instagram account, I was flooded with people tagging me or sending me messages thinking I was the show,"" she said.

Lydia said some of the messages have been hateful, which has made her feel stressed. ""I started getting abusive messages from people. People were getting angry with me because they were mega fans... and thought I took the account from the show. ""I had to turn off notifications on my Instagram because it was just constant. My phone has been flooded."" Lydia's accounts have been so popular that she's been kicked out of them several times and been asked to reset her password. ""People were reporting my account and endless people have tried to hack into my account, I keep getting emails from people trying to log in. It's been really frustrating,"" she said. Lydia said that coupled with the loss of income and association with the TV series, she is considering changing her name - and the brand she's built up for more than a decade. ""My SEO [search engine optimisation] is completely messed up now,"" she said. ""If you search for me and my brand which I've had for over 10 years... all you get is the TV show. More recently I've been turned down for work because of my handle. ""I guess it's the connotations of the show - it's a very violent show, maybe it's that?"" In addition to her live-streaming, Lydia does some presenting and advertising work - which has suffered. ""The companies who were giving me this recent role specifically told me I didn't get the work because of my Squid Game handle,"" she said. And while she doesn't want to change her name, she isn't sure if she has a choice. ""I feel down about the whole situation and incredibly fed up,"" she said.

"Average house price more than Â£250,000, says lender","A typical UK home costs more than Â£250,000 for the first time after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year, according to the Nationwide. The building society said the average house price was Â£250,311 in October, up 0.7% on the previous month. It said this was an increase of Â£30,728 since the start of the pandemic. Covid has coincided with intense demand from buyers unmatched by supply. Official forecasters say the pace of house price rises will slow. ""The dynamics of the housing market may be about to shift slowly once again, but make no mistake, the boom still isn't over,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. UK house prices have risen sharply over the last 18 months owing to changing preferences of buyers, who are now looking for more indoor and outside space, but those properties have not been plentiful on the market. That has led to intense competition among potential buyers in some areas, particularly in rural and coastal spots. The market also been buoyed by tax incentives, with ministers introducing stamp duty holidays, as well as cheap borrowing costs. Those tax breaks are now over, and there is widespread speculation thatmortgage rates will risefrom the ultra-low levels of recent times. What an interest rate rise would mean for you The epicentre of Britain's house price boom ""We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,"" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics. The outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision will be one factor affecting house prices in the months ahead. ""The outlook remains extremely uncertain,"" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner. ""If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months - especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences."" The government's official, independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that house prices would continue to rise in the coming years, albeit at a slower rate. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home, especially if the cost of borrowing rises. The OBR has now predicted that house prices will go up by 8.6% this year, compared with a year earlier. The annual rise would then slow to 3.2% in 2022, before decelerating further to 0.9% in 2023, it said. This would be followed by rises of 1.9% in 2024, 2.9% in 2025, and 3.5% in 2026, although longer-term forecasts and more difficult to make accurately.

Domestic Covid passport app launched in NI,"The new app was developed to help businesses to check their customers' vaccination status A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination status within Northern Ireland has been launched by the health department. TheCovid Cert Check NI app,externalwill facilitate ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues. The department has also updated its COVIDCert NI app which allows people travelling abroad to prove vaccination. It can now be updated to show the ""domestic use"" certificate. The apps are free to download and can be used on smartphones and tablet computers. Currently people in Northern Ireland are not required to prove their vaccination status in order to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues. However Stormont ministers recently published a contingency plan which referred to the ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings"". It is one of a number of contingency measures which could be introduced over the winter if ministers feel such checks are necessary. ""Decisions on whether domestic certification would be introduced on a compulsory basis in Northern Ireland settings will rest with the Northern Ireland Executive,"" the department said in a statement. Vaccine passports a 'no brainer', says Mallon Unlocking options 'limited' by jab passport delay NI vaccine app 'built for overseas travel only' It added that the new Cert Check NI app would be ""more user-friendly and reliable than using the printed vaccination cards to prove you have had both jabs"". The earlierCOVIDCert NI app was launched in July, in response to changes in international travel rules. Since then, more than 228,500 vaccine certificates have been issued to its Northern Ireland users. The existing COVIDCert NI has now been updated to cater for domestic use as well as international travel Now, people who have already downloaded the existing COVIDCert NI app for international travel will be given an option to activate their ""domestic certificate"". To use this new feature, they will have to take a selfie photo with their phone or tablet computer which is then ""locked into the app"". The purpose of adding the selfie is to prevent abuse of the system and it also avoids users having to present separate photo ID when they use the COVIDCert NI app as proof of vaccination status. The department said users' selfie photos will stay on their device within the app but the image is ""not shared with or collected by anyone else"". ""Citizens are encouraged to download the app, and ensure that they have the necessary certificates downloaded, should they wish to present them,"" the statement said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the app showed ""just how easy it would be to introduce mandatory vaccination certification across all our hospitality and entertainment businesses"". He said while many businesses may choose to use the app, the decision should have been made at Stormont to protect the health service. ""The SDLP will continue to push for vaccine certification,"" he added. While it is not mandatory, Northern Ireland now has a Covid-19 certificate which can be used in domestic and social settings. It looks a lot more professional than the current blue card that hardly resembles anything official. It is available and good to go, but only on a voluntary basis. However, it does pave the way for the Northern Ireland Executive to introduce compulsory checks at the flick of a switch if and when it is required, for instance post-Christmas when health officials might need to call for greater control over the hospitality industry. That might need to happen if the health service becomes overwhelmed, and by making vaccine certification checks mandatory it could mean avoiding another lockdown. The new app was developed to assist Northern Ireland-based organisations to check their customers' vaccination status and can be scanned by participating venues.

By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target. An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise. And although the plans will need to be published, the government said ""the aim is to increase transparency and accountability"" and the UK was not ""making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory"". The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the ""first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre"". He said the changes would mean: ""Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards."" In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (Â£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. What does net zero mean? Green investing: How your savings can fight climate change However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were ""doomed to fail"". ""Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. ""However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,"" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still ""pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects."" Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear. ""None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,"" he said. Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. ""Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,"" he said. However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (Â£95trn) of private capital ""is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero"". In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. Can COP26 really save the planet? What's the climate impact of private jets at COP26? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures? Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023. The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there. A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based ""gold standard"" for the plans in order to guard against so-called ""greenwashing"" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance. However, the government said there was ""not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like,external"". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (Â£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying ""transparency was critical"". She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry ""to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers"". But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were ""real business opportunities"" in ""adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices"". Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a ""valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation"". ""It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,"" she added. And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would ""spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business"". Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

Taliban bans foreign currencies in AfghanistanThe country's economy is on the brink of collapse after the exodus of international support.,"The Taliban has banned the use of foreign currencies in Afghanistan, a move that could further disrupt an economy on the brink of collapse. ""The economic situation and national interests in the country require that all Afghans use Afghani currency in their every trade,"" the Taliban said. The economy is struggling due to the withdrawal of international financial support after the Taliban took control. The US dollar has been used widely in Afghanistan's markets. Dollars are also often used for trade in areas bordering Afghanistan's neighbours such as Pakistan. ""The Islamic Emirate instructs all citizens, shopkeepers, traders, businessmen and the general public to henceforth conduct all transactions in Afghanis and strictly refrain from using foreign currency,""Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement posted online,external. ""Anyone violating this order will face legal action,"" the statement said. After the Taliban seized control of the country in August, billions of dollars of Afghanistan's overseas assets were frozen by the US Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe. ""We believe that it's essential that we maintain our sanctions against the Taliban but at the same time find ways for legitimate humanitarian assistance to get to the Afghan people. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Deputy United States Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the US Senate Banking Committee last month. The Taliban has called for the release of Afghanistan's assets that are being held overseas as the nation faces a severe cash crunch. Afghanistan has also been hit by the exodus of foreign aid. Grants from overseas previously financed three quarters of its public spending. Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Afghanistan will no longer be able to access its resources, while the World Bank also halted funding for projects in the country. Last month, the IMF warned thatthe country's economy could shrink by 30% this year, pushing millions into poverty and causing a humanitarian crisis. The fund also said that Afghanistan's economic woes could fuel a refugee crisis impacting neighbouring countries, Turkey and Europe. The country is also suffering from a severe drought, which has ruined much of its wheat crop and sent prices soaring. The United Nations World Food Programme has warned that millions of Afghans could face starvation due to a combination of the drought, conflict and Covid-19. However, although Western powers have said that they want to avoid a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan, they have refused to officially recognise the Taliban government.

"Average house price now more than Â£250,000, says lender","A typical UK home costs more than Â£250,000 for the first time after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year, according to the Nationwide. The building society said the average house price was Â£250,311 in October, up 0.7% on the previous month. It said this was an increase of Â£30,728 since the start of the pandemic. Covid has coincided with intense demand from buyers unmatched by supply. Official forecasters say the pace of house price rises will slow. ""The dynamics of the housing market may be about to shift slowly once again, but make no mistake, the boom still isn't over,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. UK house prices have risen sharply over the last 18 months owing to changing preferences of buyers, who are now looking for more indoor and outside space, but those properties have not been plentiful on the market. That has led to intense competition among potential buyers in some areas, particularly in rural and coastal spots. The market also been buoyed by tax incentives, with ministers introducing stamp duty holidays, as well as cheap borrowing costs. Those tax breaks are now over, and there is widespread speculation thatmortgage rates will risefrom the ultra-low levels of recent times. What an interest rate rise would mean for you The epicentre of Britain's house price boom ""We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,"" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics. The outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision will be one factor affecting house prices in the months ahead. ""The outlook remains extremely uncertain,"" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner. ""If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months - especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences."" The government's official, independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that house prices would continue to rise in the coming years, albeit at a slower rate. It means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home, especially if the cost of borrowing rises. The OBR has now predicted that house prices will go up by 8.6% this year, compared with a year earlier. The annual rise would then slow to 3.2% in 2022, before decelerating further to 0.9% in 2023, it said. This would be followed by rises of 1.9% in 2024, 2.9% in 2025, and 3.5% in 2026, although longer-term forecasts and more difficult to make accurately.

What is net zero?,"In order to help meet international climate targets, the world needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050, the UN says. This will involve major changes for governments, businesses and individuals. Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This main way to do this is to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the first place. But not all emissions can be eliminated completely, so those that remain need to actively removed. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill, as well as other sources. These gases increase global temperatures by trapping extra energy in the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, rapiddeforestation across the worldmeans there are fewer trees to absorb CO2. Under the2015 Paris climate agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. To achieve this, CO2 emissions need to fall by nearly half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. But despite these international commitments, emissionsremain at record highs,external. A really simple guide to climate change Natural ways of removing CO2include planting treesandrestoring peatlands. Trees can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere There are also novel, human-designed methods - at very early stages - designed to take CO2 directly out of the air. Carbon captureis a related technology, where CO2 produced in power stations or other industrial processes is captured before it is released into the atmosphere, and stored underground. While these technologies could be important in future, they are expensive, and can currently only cancel out a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions which are still being produced. They are not a substitute for making drastic cuts to fossil fuel use, the International Energy Agency warns. To help achieve its 2050 target, UK governments have made a series of pledges, which include: achievingso-called 'clean' electricity by 2030, by rapidly increasing wind and solar generation ending the sale ofnew fully petrol and diesel cars by 2030 installing600,000 electric heat pumps a yearby 2028 investing intechnology to capture and store CO2 The UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 werearound 50% of 1990 levels,external. This figure only includes emissions generated within the UK, in line with UN reporting standards. Under the Paris climate agreement, the UK needs to reduce its emissionsby 68% by 2030,externalcompared with 1990 levels - a key step towards achieving net zero by 2050. In July 2024, the UK's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC),warned that only a third of emissions cuts needed to meet this goalwere backed up by credible policies. At the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer announced a new target to cut the UK's annual emissions by 81% versus 1990 levels by 2035. Piers Forster, interim chair of the CCC, welcomed the announcement, which he said would ""support jobs and investment"". However, he warned that UK also needed to demonstrate greater progress regarding electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting. What is COP29 and what will be discussed? About 145 countrieshave - or are considering - net zero targets, covering about 90% of global emissions,external. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline. China- currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - is aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions are not fully developed, but its electric vehicle sales and renewable energy sector have beengrowing rapidly,external. China is quickly expanding its solar and wind capacity TheUShas historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called theInflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. TheEU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March 2023, it announced its own green investment package, called theNet Zero Industry Act.,external RussiaandIndiaare also significant emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2060 and 2070 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up. How is my country tackling climate change? There is controversy about how some countries and companies might reach net zero. For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imports energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. But in reality, it may not have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. There are also schemes that enable countries or companies to reach net zero by paying others to reduce theirs instead - for example giving funds to plant trees. But these can be controversial, withconcerns about how effective these schemes really are. Some climate scientists also fear that a focus on net zero targets in 2050 or beyond can underplay the need for rapid emissions cuts now, withthe world far off track to meet its climate goals. While the most significant changes need to come from government,individuals can also play their part to help reach net zero.

Will UK meet its climate targets?,"The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. The UK has been relatively successful in cutting its emissions so far. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have expressed concerns that the UKcould miss its future targets, owing to ""worryingly slow"" recent progress. And in May 2024 theHigh Court ruledfor the second time in two years that the government would have to redraft its net zero strategy because its existing plan did not provide enough detail about how future targets could be met. What progress is being made? Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions from electricity supply havefallen by more than three-quarters.,external This is due to a decline in using fossil fuels - in particular coal - for electricity. In 2023, about 47% of electricity was generated by renewables, such as wind and solar,according to provisional data,external. That is up from 7% in 2010. The government pledged thatall of the UK's electricity would come from low carbon sourcesby 2035. It plans toincrease offshore wind capacity five-fold,externalby 2030,increase solar power capacity five-fold,externalby 2035, andexpand nuclear power,external. However, reports by theCCC,external, theNational Audit Office,externaland across-party group of MPs,externalhave warned that the UK risks missing its 2035 target without clearer planning and much faster action. Where does the UK get its energy and electricity? Despite the push for renewable energy, the government announced in July 2023 that it was granting100 oil and gas production licencesfor the North Sea. The government says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy such as gas from ""hostile states"". But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports andbring bills downfor consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero,external"". North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked Buildings account forabout 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions,external, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 electricheat pumpsa year by 2028 to replace gas boilers, but this target is ""significantly off track"",the CCC says,external. In 2023, the Prime Ministerincreased grantsto Â£7,500 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. This has led to asurge in applications.,external However, he also said around a fifth of homes would never be required to switch from a fossil fuel boiler. This makes net zero by 2050 ""considerably harder to achieve"", the CCC warned. The UK has some of theleast energy-efficient homes,externalin Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing, by reducing the energy needed for heating. The government has introduced theGreat British Insulation Scheme,externalto help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. But in September 2023, the government cancelled regulations that would have required landlords to improve the energy efficiency of private rented homes. Transport (not including aviation and shipping)accounted for just under a quarter,externalof UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government hasdelayed its banon the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, a move which has divided the car industry. But it has set quotas for the percentage of a manufacturer's sales that have to bezero emission, increasing year-on-year to 80% by 2030. This has been welcomed by the CCC. Electric car sales have been faring relatively well,according to the CCC,external. In 2023,16.5% of new car sales were battery electric vehicles,external- up from less than 2% in 2019. Thegovernment wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points,externalfor electric cars by 2030, in addition to those in private homes or workplaces. The number of public charging points had increased tomore than 60,000,externalby the end of April 2024 - up by 45% from the previous year- but these are not evenly distributed across the UK. Nearly half of allnew bus registrations,externalwere zero-emission in 2023. The government has committed further funding forregional electric bus schemes,external, but is yet to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, butthe CCC argues,externalit needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall,the CCC says,externalthere has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport. Flyingmakes up,externalabout 7% of overall UK emissions, andshipping about,external3%. The UK hasa strategy,externalfor delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised forrelying too muchon technologies such as cleaner fuels and zero emissions aircraft that are unlikely to be widely available anytime soon. As a result,the CCC says,externalthat the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. In April 2024 the government announceda target for 10% of jet fuel to come from ""sustainable sources"",externalby 2030. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping,the CCC says,external. Agriculture and the way land is usedproduce 11%,externalof the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but theCCC said,externalit failed to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised fornot doing moreto encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating more plant-based food, for example. Meat consumption in the UKhas been fallingthough - down 17% in the decade to 2019. In February 2023, the governmentreleased details,externalof its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Trees and peatlandsplay important roles,externalin removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. UKforest cover,externalis 13%,among the lowest,externalin Europe. The government has atarget to plant,external30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting hasnot risen above,external15,000 hectares since 2001. TheUK forestry body has warnedthat there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated thatonly around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state,external, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlandsare responsible for around 5%of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up CO2. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels areless than half this,external, leaving the target ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. Thegovernment considers,externalhydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. Itwants to have,externala 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is very much in its infancy, andthe government admits,externalit will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. It has announced aseries of projects and incentives for investment,external. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating in 2026, buthad to cancel a proposed trialbecause the main source of hydrogen supply was not ready. The government sees technologies to capture the CO2 produced by power stations and industrial processes as a key part of its net zero strategy. It aims to capture and storebetween 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year,externalby 2030. In March 2023, the Chancellor pledged Â£20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, andseveral projects have been announced,externalaround the UK. But the technology is still emerging, is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change? Industrial emissionsrepresent about 14%,externalof the UK's total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two thirds by 2035. It hasa scheme to cap the amount of emissions,externalallowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries.

"UK firms forced to show how they will hit net zeroCompanies must outline how they aim to meet the UK's 2050 net-zero target, under government plans.Business","Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules. By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target. An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise. And although the plans will need to be published, the government said ""the aim is to increase transparency and accountability"" and the UK was not ""making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory"". The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the ""first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre"". He said the changes would mean: ""Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards."" In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (Â£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. What does net zero mean? Green investing: How your savings can fight climate change However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were ""doomed to fail"". ""Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. ""However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,"" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still ""pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects."" Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear. ""None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,"" he said. Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. ""Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,"" he said. However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (Â£95trn) of private capital ""is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero"". In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. Can COP26 really save the planet? What's the climate impact of private jets at COP26? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures? Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023. The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there. A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based ""gold standard"" for the plans in order to guard against so-called ""greenwashing"" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance. However, the government said there was ""not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like,external"". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (Â£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying ""transparency was critical"". She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry ""to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers"". But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were ""real business opportunities"" in ""adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices"". Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a ""valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation"". ""It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,"" she added. And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would ""spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business"". Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

Negotiators knuckle down as COP focus turns to cash,"On day four of the climate summit, the focus turns to how the world finances the transition to green economies World leaders have left Glasgow with some important deals agreed but many difficult issues remain on the negotiating table Developing countries are angry that $100bn in promised annual climate finance is yet to materialise They say that those with the most historical responsibility for climate change should pay for efforts to tackle it and adapt to its effects UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promises to accelerate that finance and says the global financial system is being rewired for net zero COP26's overarching goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of day four of the COP26 climate conference. We'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to the energy industry. Here's a reminder of the day's developments:  Today's live page was written by George Bowden, Paul McLaren and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay, Claudia Allen and Kevin Ponniah. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Expectations for this COP26 conference were low. Governments are still far, far from achieving their goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. We've already got dangerous warming in the form of floods, record heatwaves and wildfires, with a rise of just 1.1C. So you could be forgiven for thinking it's all bad news. But seasoned COP observers have been pleasantly surprised by a slew of announcements that suggest the world is on an unstoppable path to a low-carbon future. So far so good, then. But there have been disappointments. It had been expected that China would improve its offer to peak emissions by 2030. At least a token gesture was anticipated, but it's brought nothing. The only consolation for the COP is that China usually over-delivers on its promises - unlike some others. Read Roger's full analysis here. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions - and thanks to Dr Liz Stephens and Helen Briggs for answering today's selection. If you have comments or questions you can contact us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk- remember to mention climate in your email subject. Shortly, we'll be bringing our live coverage of day four of COP26 to a close, but we'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to energy. Helen Briggs We've had a few questions on this theme of what happens if countries donât keep their promises, including from Diana Butungi in Kampala. She wants to know if China and India could be sanctioned if they failed to set a 2050 net-zero target. The deal the world signed up to in Paris is largely based on carrot not stick, when it comes to goals for slashing emissions. Countries set their own emissions targets, which are assessed every five years. The process relies on trust and the sense weâre all in this together â with leaders seen as lagging behind if they donât step up to the mark. But while there are no sanctions for missing emissions targets or not pledging to do enough to keep warming in check, there is talk of shortening the timetable by which countries submit their emissions plans so they come to the table with more ambitious plans sooner than 2025. Wael HusseinBBC News, Cairo Alexandria is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea The city of Alexandria, on Egyptâs Mediterranean coast, has
survived invasions, earthquakes and fires since it was established 2,000 years
ago by Alexander the Great. Now, it's facing a new threat: rising sea levels. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday that Alexandria would be among the low-lying major cities âlost
beneath the wavesâ if global temperatures rose by 4C. In response, Alexandriaâs Governor Mohammed el-Sherif has noted that the city, which is home
to 5 million people, is already suffering from the effects of climate change. Sherif says rainfall has been increasing year after year, causing
huge problems. In 2015, six people were killed when a severe storm flooded
large parts of the city. Authorities have installed concrete sea defences to
reduce the impact of waves, but they cannot stop the water level from rising. Rachel King says she was thrilled to meet US President Joe Biden US President Joe Biden may have ended his flying visit to Scotland for COP26 - but one hotel worker is still ""on cloud nine"" after meeting him. Rachel King works at the Dalmahoy Hotel, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, where the president was staying withhis huge entourage.

Read more on this story here US President Joe Biden waves from Air Force One as he departs Edinburgh on Wednesday evening Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Time for a simple one now, and reader Thomas Sheehan from Durham asks what is stopping the greenhouse gases from disappearing off into space and beyond. The Earthâs gravitational force keeps the gases from leaving our atmosphere. All planets in our solar system have an atmosphere in one form or another, for example, Mars, a smaller planet than Earth,has an atmosphere of less than 1% of the volume of our own atmosphere,external. Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼terLatin America Editor, BBC News One of the tangible achievements to have come out of COP26
has been the expansion of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, announced by Ecuadorâs
president in Glasgow. The waters around the Galapagos Islands teem with endangered
species such as the endangered whale shark. But in recent years, a huge Chinese fishing fleet has been
accused by conservationists of âpillagingâ the waters surrounding the islands. President Lasso tells the BBC that the expansion is not in
response to the movements of the Chinese fleet but rather âto show that action
rather than words were the most effective way to fight climate changeâ. The move has been welcomed as âa brilliant first stepâ by conservationists.
Among them is Sarah Darwin, great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, whose
theory of evolution was inspired by the biodiversity he found on the islands. Sarah Darwin, a botanist and an ambassador for the Galapagos
Conservation Trust says that she hopes that the conservation efforts conducted
in and around the islands would set a wider example. ""If you can save the Galapagos, you can save the
world,"" she says. You can read more about the expansionhere. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Peter Falandysz in County Durham, England, asks if anyone in government is looking at reducing speed limits on motorways to save fuel and cut emission - might it be a quick and relatively easy thing to implement? There are ways to save a bit of fuel â and therefore pollution â by driving more smoothly or slowly, but this is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the huge emissions cuts needed over the course of the decade to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels that power our cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. Transport accounts for about one-fifth of global carbon dioxide emissions, with much of it coming from cars. The governmentâs net-zero strategy relies on a shift towards electric vehicles, among other things. And we will all have to rethink the way we travel in a net-zero world. There have been several protests taking place in Glasgow today, including the one involving the inflatable Nessie that was escorted away by police. Protesters
from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are holding demonstrations in central Glasgow outside the offices of companies they accuse of ""greenwashing"" - paying lip service to climate change but not tackling it. BBC
Scotlandâs James Cheyne says at least two XR protesters were arrested this
afternoon after a demonstration outside power company SSE. Police Scotland says a number of officers were sprayed with paint and two arrests were made. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading On Tuesday we reported on measures to reduce emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Alan Morley-Fletcher from Cornwall in England asks if home composting in your own garden emits harmful methane? And, if so, what can we do to compost in a non-polluting way? Decomposing material only emits methane under anaerobic (zero oxygen) conditions, like in a landfill. A well-managed compost heap decomposes under aerobic conditions, so no methane is released. You can ensure that your compost heap has enough oxygen by balancing green and brown material. TheRoyal Horticultural Society recommends,externalthat 25% to 50% of the material should be soft green waste, with the rest brown material such as leaves, cardboard and woodchip. The inclusion of brown waste as well as turning the heap regularly will ensure that there is enough oxygen for aerobic bacteria to thrive. Remember too that home composting means that the environmental costs of collecting and transporting the waste are avoided, as are the transport costs of bringing compost into your garden. Leading organisations in the world of sport have agreed to reach net zero emissions by 2040 - as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030. All new and existing members of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be called upon to adopt the targets, which were agreed today. The agreement aims to gather sports organisations, teams, athletes, and fans in a concerted effort to raise awareness for the urgency required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa says: ""The sector eagerly took up the challenge, but also told us that they want to do more and to do it faster."" Signatories to the framework,externalinclude the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, Athletics Kenya, BBC Sport, the Premier League, Formula E and Munster Rugby. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow One of the questions we've had is: why can't we ban deforestation sooner? Forests have long been seen as a critical part of the climate solution, but rates of deforestation around the world are still rising, despite international efforts. In 2014, the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it in 2030, but the agreement failed. One of the first deals struck in Glasgow was a new pact on deforestation, signed by more than 100 world leaders, who pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The move was given a cautious welcome by experts, but some said the target of 2030 was disappointing. Part of the problem is that many of the worldâs remaining forests are in countries in the global south where jobs and livelihoods depend on exports such as palm oil, beef and soya. And some people living in the Amazon depend on the forest for their livelihoods and need support in finding new incomes. There are a complex set of problems that need to be solved if the world is to do better at preventing deforestation. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Many readers have asked about the speed of change, including Graeme from Somerset in England, who says: Hasnât Covid proven that people can quickly switch careers if financial support is there?  Canât we just ban deforestation by the end of 2022 rather than by 2030? While the rest of the world still demands exports such as palm oil or beef, there is still more money to be made from clearing forests than protecting them. It is not easy for those who make livelihoods from these exports to find new incomes, nor is it easy to bring in policies and legislation at national and local levels both to stop deforestation and enforce that stop. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of our readers are interested in the agriculture sector and how much difference food choices make.Preeti Singh, in India, asks:What is the direct and indirect impact of meat and dairy consumption on climate change? Beef is by far the worst food you can eat from a climate change perspective. This is because cows produce methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and have large land-use requirements for grazing and feed production. A study by the UNâs Food and Agricultural Organisation in 2013,externalestimated that livestock production as a whole accounted for 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. This estimate takes into account the full life cycle of the supply chain, from land use, feed production, animal production (including methane emissions) and transportation of products. Beef and dairy production is by far the biggest source of emissions in the livestock sector, counting for 8.8% of that 14.5%. The demand for meat is predicted to increase as societies become more affluent and the worldâs population grows.One estimate,externalsuggests that livestock production will grow by 25% between 2015 and 2030. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Bernath Bence in the Netherlands asks if there are plans for governments to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? ""It seems that solutions might exist, but up to now it is financed by private companies."" Carbon capture is a cutting-edge, costly and controversial technology, but some experts believe it will be part of the solution to achieving net zero. So-called nature solutions - such as planting trees and restoring peatlands - take time to reap rewards, and remain vulnerable to logging or wildfires. Some argue they may not be enough in themselves and are calling for a mass rollout of plants to capture carbon dioxide and bury the gases underground. Despite questions over the use of carbon capture, some countries are forging ahead. Efforts are under way in Norway, the Netherlands and the UK to build up networks for capturing greenhouse gases and storing them under the North Sea. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow We've heard about wealthy nations, but what influence do less developed, poorer countries have during the negotiation process? That's a question from Navein in Malaysia. The idea that everyone has a place at the table is central to the negotiations. Poorer nations have been key players in the talks for years. The issue of mutual trust between developed and developing countries is a prevailing theme at Glasgow, with impassioned speeches from leaders of countries facing the biggest devastation from climate change. The run-up to this conference was marred by concerns over access to Covid vaccines and problems caused by travel restrictions. Ensuring everyone feels they have a voice will be central to the success of the talks. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of you have asked what an ordinary person who is not in a position of power can do to help with climate change. Gemma-Kirstie in Hove in England asks: I want to do something but sometimes feel helpless, so my question is: what can each one of us do that will have an impact? While it is commonly quoted that 71% of global emissions are produced by just 100 companies, it is us who consume what these companies produce. For most of us, reducing our air travel and eating less meat are the single biggest changes we can make to reduce our own carbon footprint, but we also need to lobby for change in our society as a whole, for example to make sure that large infrastructure investments are undertaken in ways compatible with our climate goals. We're turning our attention now to your questions about climate change. Answering them are Dr Liz Stephens, an associate professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading, and the BBC's own science correspondent Helen Briggs. We'll also continue to bring you the latest developments from Glasgow. By Daniel Kraemer Rich countries have failed to meet a pledge made over a decade ago to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cope with climate. That target has now been pushed back to 2023, although some remain optimistic it could be reached earlier. The group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) say this delay is unacceptable and that the figure of $100bn falls far short of what these nations need to deal with a crisis not of their own making. Various declarations have been made by rich nations at the climate summit on how they plan meet their goals on climate finance for developing nations.

LiveLiveNegotiators knuckle down as COP focus turns to cash3 minutes ago,"On day four of the climate summit, the focus turns to how the world finances the transition to green economies World leaders have left Glasgow with some important deals agreed but many difficult issues remain on the negotiating table Developing countries are angry that $100bn in promised annual climate finance is yet to materialise They say that those with the most historical responsibility for climate change should pay for efforts to tackle it and adapt to its effects UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promises to accelerate that finance and says the global financial system is being rewired for net zero COP26's overarching goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of day four of the COP26 climate conference. We'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to the energy industry. Here's a reminder of the day's developments:  Today's live page was written by George Bowden, Paul McLaren and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay, Claudia Allen and Kevin Ponniah. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Expectations for this COP26 conference were low. Governments are still far, far from achieving their goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. We've already got dangerous warming in the form of floods, record heatwaves and wildfires, with a rise of just 1.1C. So you could be forgiven for thinking it's all bad news. But seasoned COP observers have been pleasantly surprised by a slew of announcements that suggest the world is on an unstoppable path to a low-carbon future. So far so good, then. But there have been disappointments. It had been expected that China would improve its offer to peak emissions by 2030. At least a token gesture was anticipated, but it's brought nothing. The only consolation for the COP is that China usually over-delivers on its promises - unlike some others. Read Roger's full analysis here. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions - and thanks to Dr Liz Stephens and Helen Briggs for answering today's selection. If you have comments or questions you can contact us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk- remember to mention climate in your email subject. Shortly, we'll be bringing our live coverage of day four of COP26 to a close, but we'll be back tomorrow morning, when the focus turns to energy. Helen Briggs We've had a few questions on this theme of what happens if countries donât keep their promises, including from Diana Butungi in Kampala. She wants to know if China and India could be sanctioned if they failed to set a 2050 net-zero target. The deal the world signed up to in Paris is largely based on carrot not stick, when it comes to goals for slashing emissions. Countries set their own emissions targets, which are assessed every five years. The process relies on trust and the sense weâre all in this together â with leaders seen as lagging behind if they donât step up to the mark. But while there are no sanctions for missing emissions targets or not pledging to do enough to keep warming in check, there is talk of shortening the timetable by which countries submit their emissions plans so they come to the table with more ambitious plans sooner than 2025. Wael HusseinBBC News, Cairo Alexandria is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea The city of Alexandria, on Egyptâs Mediterranean coast, has
survived invasions, earthquakes and fires since it was established 2,000 years
ago by Alexander the Great. Now, it's facing a new threat: rising sea levels. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday that Alexandria would be among the low-lying major cities âlost
beneath the wavesâ if global temperatures rose by 4C. In response, Alexandriaâs Governor Mohammed el-Sherif has noted that the city, which is home
to 5 million people, is already suffering from the effects of climate change. Sherif says rainfall has been increasing year after year, causing
huge problems. In 2015, six people were killed when a severe storm flooded
large parts of the city. Authorities have installed concrete sea defences to
reduce the impact of waves, but they cannot stop the water level from rising. Rachel King says she was thrilled to meet US President Joe Biden US President Joe Biden may have ended his flying visit to Scotland for COP26 - but one hotel worker is still ""on cloud nine"" after meeting him. Rachel King works at the Dalmahoy Hotel, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, where the president was staying withhis huge entourage. The 30-year-old met the president in the canteen area of the venue and was thrilled to shake his hand. ""I'll remember this for the rest of my life,"" she says. Read more on this story here US President Joe Biden waves from Air Force One as he departs Edinburgh on Wednesday evening Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Time for a simple one now, and reader Thomas Sheehan from Durham asks what is stopping the greenhouse gases from disappearing off into space and beyond. The Earthâs gravitational force keeps the gases from leaving our atmosphere. All planets in our solar system have an atmosphere in one form or another, for example, Mars, a smaller planet than Earth,has an atmosphere of less than 1% of the volume of our own atmosphere,external. Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼terLatin America Editor, BBC News One of the tangible achievements to have come out of COP26
has been the expansion of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, announced by Ecuadorâs
president in Glasgow. The waters around the Galapagos Islands teem with endangered
species such as the endangered whale shark. But in recent years, a huge Chinese fishing fleet has been
accused by conservationists of âpillagingâ the waters surrounding the islands. President Lasso tells the BBC that the expansion is not in
response to the movements of the Chinese fleet but rather âto show that action
rather than words were the most effective way to fight climate changeâ. The move has been welcomed as âa brilliant first stepâ by conservationists.
Among them is Sarah Darwin, great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, whose
theory of evolution was inspired by the biodiversity he found on the islands. Sarah Darwin, a botanist and an ambassador for the Galapagos
Conservation Trust says that she hopes that the conservation efforts conducted
in and around the islands would set a wider example. ""If you can save the Galapagos, you can save the
world,"" she says. You can read more about the expansionhere. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Peter Falandysz in County Durham, England, asks if anyone in government is looking at reducing speed limits on motorways to save fuel and cut emission - might it be a quick and relatively easy thing to implement? There are ways to save a bit of fuel â and therefore pollution â by driving more smoothly or slowly, but this is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the huge emissions cuts needed over the course of the decade to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels that power our cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. Transport accounts for about one-fifth of global carbon dioxide emissions, with much of it coming from cars. The governmentâs net-zero strategy relies on a shift towards electric vehicles, among other things. And we will all have to rethink the way we travel in a net-zero world. There have been several protests taking place in Glasgow today, including the one involving the inflatable Nessie that was escorted away by police. Protesters
from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are holding demonstrations in central Glasgow outside the offices of companies they accuse of ""greenwashing"" - paying lip service to climate change but not tackling it. BBC
Scotlandâs James Cheyne says at least two XR protesters were arrested this
afternoon after a demonstration outside power company SSE. Police Scotland says a number of officers were sprayed with paint and two arrests were made. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading On Tuesday we reported on measures to reduce emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Alan Morley-Fletcher from Cornwall in England asks if home composting in your own garden emits harmful methane? And, if so, what can we do to compost in a non-polluting way? Decomposing material only emits methane under anaerobic (zero oxygen) conditions, like in a landfill. A well-managed compost heap decomposes under aerobic conditions, so no methane is released. You can ensure that your compost heap has enough oxygen by balancing green and brown material. TheRoyal Horticultural Society recommends,externalthat 25% to 50% of the material should be soft green waste, with the rest brown material such as leaves, cardboard and woodchip. The inclusion of brown waste as well as turning the heap regularly will ensure that there is enough oxygen for aerobic bacteria to thrive. Remember too that home composting means that the environmental costs of collecting and transporting the waste are avoided, as are the transport costs of bringing compost into your garden. Leading organisations in the world of sport have agreed to reach net zero emissions by 2040 - as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030. All new and existing members of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be called upon to adopt the targets, which were agreed today. The agreement aims to gather sports organisations, teams, athletes, and fans in a concerted effort to raise awareness for the urgency required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa says: ""The sector eagerly took up the challenge, but also told us that they want to do more and to do it faster."" Signatories to the framework,externalinclude the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, Athletics Kenya, BBC Sport, the Premier League, Formula E and Munster Rugby. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow One of the questions we've had is: why can't we ban deforestation sooner? Forests have long been seen as a critical part of the climate solution, but rates of deforestation around the world are still rising, despite international efforts. In 2014, the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it in 2030, but the agreement failed. One of the first deals struck in Glasgow was a new pact on deforestation, signed by more than 100 world leaders, who pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The move was given a cautious welcome by experts, but some said the target of 2030 was disappointing. Part of the problem is that many of the worldâs remaining forests are in countries in the global south where jobs and livelihoods depend on exports such as palm oil, beef and soya. And some people living in the Amazon depend on the forest for their livelihoods and need support in finding new incomes. There are a complex set of problems that need to be solved if the world is to do better at preventing deforestation. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Many readers have asked about the speed of change, including Graeme from Somerset in England, who says: Hasnât Covid proven that people can quickly switch careers if financial support is there?  Canât we just ban deforestation by the end of 2022 rather than by 2030? While the rest of the world still demands exports such as palm oil or beef, there is still more money to be made from clearing forests than protecting them. It is not easy for those who make livelihoods from these exports to find new incomes, nor is it easy to bring in policies and legislation at national and local levels both to stop deforestation and enforce that stop. Dr Liz StephensAssociate professor in climate risks and resilience, University of Reading Lots of our readers are interested in the agriculture sector and how much difference food choices make.Preeti Singh, in India, asks:What is the direct and indirect impact of meat and dairy consumption on climate change? Beef is by far the worst food you can eat from a climate change perspective. This is because cows produce methane, a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and have large land-use requirements for grazing and feed production. A study by the UNâs Food and Agricultural Organisation in 2013,externalestimated that livestock production as a whole accounted for 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. This estimate takes into account the full life cycle of the supply chain, from land use, feed production, animal production (including methane emissions) and transportation of products. Beef and dairy production is by far the biggest source of emissions in the livestock sector, counting for 8.8% of that 14.5%. The demand for meat is predicted to increase as societies become more affluent and the worldâs population grows.One estimate,externalsuggests that livestock production will grow by 25% between 2015 and 2030. Helen BriggsBBC science correspondent in Glasgow Bernath Bence in the Netherlands asks if there are plans for governments to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? ""It seems that solutions might exist, but up to now it is financed by private companies."" Carbon capture is a cutting-edge, costly and controversial technology, but some experts believe it will be part of the solution to achieving net zero. So-called nature solutions - such as planting trees and restoring peatlands - take time to reap rewards, and remain vulnerable to logging or wildfires. Some argue they may not be enough in themselves and are calling for a mass rollout of plants to capture carbon dioxide and bury the gases underground. Despite questions over the use of carbon capture, some countries are forging ahead. Efforts are under way in Norway, the Netherlands and the UK to build up networks for capturing greenhouse gases and storing them under the North Sea.

Climate summit: Daily briefingFive things you need to know about COP26 - the United Nations climate change conference - on Wednesday.,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Wednesday. Today is finance day at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and ChancellorRishi Sunak is due to set out plans to encourage large firms to work towards the UK's 2050 net-zero target.Under new Treasury rules most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to publish details, by 2023, of how they will move to low-carbon emissions. Though not mandatory, the government said the aim is to increase transparency and accountability. However, green groups say the proposals do not go far enough. This announcement comes as deals such ascutting methane emissionsandboosting green technologieswere agreed on Tuesday. To keep up-to-day with what's happening to today,follow our updates. The vast majority of world leaders viewed COP26 as an opportunity to ""press the restart button"", USPresident Joe Biden said, hailing the progress of the conference as he left.His visit ended following the conclusion of the world leaders summit, which kickstarted the conference. He left Edinburgh Airport in Air Force One after saying: ""We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role."" He added that the absence of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the summit was a ""big mistake"". To help end its reliance on coal, South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) from wealthier nationsin what President Cyril Ramaphosa says is a ""watershed moment"". The deal could have global and local implications as the country is a major emitter of greenhouse gases, which cause the planet's temperature to rise. South Africa uses coal to generate electricity. The Republic of the Marshall Islands - a sprawling nation of more than 1,200 low-lying atolls and isles in the Pacific Ocean - are only 2m above sea level. Sea level rise caused by climate change means it is one of the most threatened countries in the world, says poet and activist Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner, adding that unlike other island nations, there are no mountains and there's no higher ground to go to. She's a climate envoy at COP26 andshe told us how it feels to fight for her country's very existence. A bubble playground's making an impression on children and there's a hope it could make an impression on the world.

His balancing act may offer a template for Republicans seeking to win back suburban moderate voters who were turned off by Mr Trump's firebrand style of politics. The race could shape party messaging and battle-plans for next year's mid-term elections, when the Democrats will defend their wafer-thin majorities in Congress, and the 2024 White House election.

They had gathered hoping to see Glenn Youngkin win. Over the past several months, he has charted a course for conservatives - he talks frequently about race relations, and has denounced the teaching of critical race theory. He ran on a law-and-order platform, and opposed mask mandates, and his messaging echoed the kind that Mr Trump uses. But Mr Youngkin kept his distance from the former president. In this way, Mr Youngkin has appealed to voters who like Mr Trump's positions, but are uneasy about the man himself.

Over the past several months, he has charted a course for conservatives - he talks frequently about race relations, and has denounced the teaching of critical race theory.

Will the UK meet its climate targets?,"The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. The UK has been relatively successful in cutting its emissions so far. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have expressed concerns that the UKcould miss its future targets, owing to ""worryingly slow"" recent progress. And in May 2024 theHigh Court ruledfor the second time in two years that the government would have to redraft its net zero strategy because its existing plan did not provide enough detail about how future targets could be met. What progress is being made? Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions from electricity supply havefallen by more than three-quarters.,external This is due to a decline in using fossil fuels - in particular coal - for electricity. In 2023, about 47% of electricity was generated by renewables, such as wind and solar,according to provisional data,external. That is up from 7% in 2010. The government pledged thatall of the UK's electricity would come from low carbon sourcesby 2035. It plans toincrease offshore wind capacity five-fold,externalby 2030,increase solar power capacity five-fold,externalby 2035, andexpand nuclear power,external. However, reports by theCCC,external, theNational Audit Office,externaland across-party group of MPs,externalhave warned that the UK risks missing its 2035 target without clearer planning and much faster action. Where does the UK get its energy and electricity? Despite the push for renewable energy, the government announced in July 2023 that it was granting100 oil and gas production licencesfor the North Sea. The government says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy such as gas from ""hostile states"". But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports andbring bills downfor consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero,external"". North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked Buildings account forabout 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions,external, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 electricheat pumpsa year by 2028 to replace gas boilers, but this target is ""significantly off track"",the CCC says,external. In 2023, the Prime Ministerincreased grantsto Â£7,500 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. This has led to asurge in applications.,external However, he also said around a fifth of homes would never be required to switch from a fossil fuel boiler. This makes net zero by 2050 ""considerably harder to achieve"", the CCC warned. The UK has some of theleast energy-efficient homes,externalin Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing, by reducing the energy needed for heating. The government has introduced theGreat British Insulation Scheme,externalto help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. But in September 2023, the government cancelled regulations that would have required landlords to improve the energy efficiency of private rented homes. Transport (not including aviation and shipping)accounted for just under a quarter,externalof UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government hasdelayed its banon the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, a move which has divided the car industry. But it has set quotas for the percentage of a manufacturer's sales that have to bezero emission, increasing year-on-year to 80% by 2030. This has been welcomed by the CCC. Electric car sales have been faring relatively well,according to the CCC,external. In 2023,16.5% of new car sales were battery electric vehicles,external- up from less than 2% in 2019. Thegovernment wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points,externalfor electric cars by 2030, in addition to those in private homes or workplaces. The number of public charging points had increased tomore than 60,000,externalby the end of April 2024 - up by 45% from the previous year- but these are not evenly distributed across the UK. Nearly half of allnew bus registrations,externalwere zero-emission in 2023. The government has committed further funding forregional electric bus schemes,external, but is yet to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, butthe CCC argues,externalit needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall,the CCC says,externalthere has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport. Flyingmakes up,externalabout 7% of overall UK emissions, andshipping about,external3%. The UK hasa strategy,externalfor delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised forrelying too muchon technologies such as cleaner fuels and zero emissions aircraft that are unlikely to be widely available anytime soon. As a result,the CCC says,externalthat the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. In April 2024 the government announceda target for 10% of jet fuel to come from ""sustainable sources"",externalby 2030. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping,the CCC says,external. Agriculture and the way land is usedproduce 11%,externalof the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but theCCC said,externalit failed to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised fornot doing moreto encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating more plant-based food, for example. Meat consumption in the UKhas been fallingthough - down 17% in the decade to 2019. In February 2023, the governmentreleased details,externalof its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Trees and peatlandsplay important roles,externalin removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. UKforest cover,externalis 13%,among the lowest,externalin Europe. The government has atarget to plant,external30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting hasnot risen above,external15,000 hectares since 2001. TheUK forestry body has warnedthat there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated thatonly around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state,external, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlandsare responsible for around 5%of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up CO2. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels areless than half this,external, leaving the target ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. Thegovernment considers,externalhydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. Itwants to have,externala 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is very much in its infancy, andthe government admits,externalit will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. It has announced aseries of projects and incentives for investment,external. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating in 2026, buthad to cancel a proposed trialbecause the main source of hydrogen supply was not ready. The government sees technologies to capture the CO2 produced by power stations and industrial processes as a key part of its net zero strategy. It aims to capture and storebetween 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year,externalby 2030. In March 2023, the Chancellor pledged Â£20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, andseveral projects have been announced,externalaround the UK. But the technology is still emerging, is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change? Industrial emissionsrepresent about 14%,externalof the UK's total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two thirds by 2035. It hasa scheme to cap the amount of emissions,externalallowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries.
